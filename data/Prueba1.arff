'Its spot on! Stopped at the Agora about 5 years ago, and new I'd be back, which I was just lst week! Nothings changed... quite literally! I'm not sure its had a lick of paint since I was last there, but honestly compared to other hotels, its a delight!The location for starters is brilliant.. right on the Singel next to the flower market....within a 5 min walk you can be at every main attraction!The rooms are comfortable with a TV which has some English channels. The cleaner came in every day! Bathroom was nice, we only had a shower in our room, which was ok, but would've appreciated a soak in a bath after walking around all day! Breakfast was nice! Nothing hot, just croissants, cheese, ham, cereal, boiled eggs etc.... but very nice! You don't want to be filling your belly too full if you're gonna be trogging round all day!Staff are brilliant, very friendly! Speak excellent English too!The only advise I can give is to get this hotel booked! If you ask for a discount, YOU WILL GET ONE - just be cheaky, I was! Another word of advise.... don't sleep with the window open at night, we were almost eaten alive by the pesky mosquitos - totally our fault, we never expected mosquitos in Amsterdam so never gave 'em a 2nd thought!!

'Needs A Major Overhaul We stayed at the Hotel Agora with our three children in March. We were supposed to have adjacent rooms, but due to an emergency our rooms were two floors apart. We didn't feel comfortable with that, so my husband and I split up to be with the kids. We expected small rooms and lots of stairs, and that was fine. But as I entered the rooms and saw the stained carpets, chipped paint, and cigarette burns on the blankets I just felt sick. I asked what we could do to get out of the reservation but of course we were stuck with it. Along with thin towels and lukewarm showers, the last night we battled the mosquitoes that came in when the cleaning staff left the windows wide open. Pretty much the only advantage was the location--very central. And there is a mediocre breakfast included in the rate. I can say that the pillows and mattress were good (no mattress pad of course, just a thin sheet), the place is very secure, and the staff was friendly and helpful (though young). For the price you should be able to do much better! ',POOR,
'A bargain! Booked over the internet, paid 80 euros. Great location, staff super-friendly, room pretty good, breakfast fine. Its not the Ritz, but a great deal price-wise and a brilliant location. ',GOOD,
'Good location, but... We went to Amsterdam in Agora Hotel last june. It was the second time. We went once before a couple of years before. This time I was very disappointed to see that the general state of the room was very mediocre compared to the rate (more than 140 鈧?per night) : dirty walls, carpet with holes, outdates interior decoration. In a word, the room would have deserved a good renovation! However, the location of the hotel is really perfect to visit and enjoy amsterdam day and night life! Just be aware that the rooms on the street are quite noisy because of a night club next door. In the morning the breakfast is correct. And the staff is nice and accommodating.In sum, not too bad but don't expect too much !!! ',POOR,
'A Disappointment This hotel has nothing to reccomend it other than the location. Let's just say the bath featured a can of bug-spray and mildewed tile. Then there was the dirty carpet, the tired bedding, the youth hostel level of service. This was basically a diappointment all-round. Perhaps some of the rooms are nicer and more updated. Ours was a horror -- the type of room in which you do not want to spend an extra 10 minutes. Terrible value for the money. ',POOR,
'You Can't Beat the Location This is the 3rd time we stayed here over the 10 trips or so we have taken to Amsterdam....Main reason why we stay here....we love the location...And the staff is very friendly and helpful...The rooms are very small...and i see the hotel has become quite run down.but we still had a very pleasant stay...We stayed 7 nights in total...4 at first...then we went to India...and then 3 after we returned from India..We got the same room both times, room 24 overlooking the canal. The plus with this room is it is on the first floor!! It is fairly noisy late at night as there is a night club next door...but....i still love staying here, as anything we want is right outside the door, or a very short walk.I hope that they do a little renovating in the future, and will be sure to stay there again!! ',POOR,
'Very central Hotel Agora is incredibly central, overlooking the Singel canal, which is definitely its biggest selling point. Our room was a bit tired-looking, although the bathroom had clearly been fairly recently replaced. As with any of the canal-side houses, the hotel is quite narrow and as a result the staircase is relatively steep and twisty - not ideal for anyone with mobility issues. The breakfast is included in the price of the room, which makes a nice change. The buffet is limited but good - the usual croissants, ham and cheese: John was a particular fan of the chocolate croissants!For a weekend trip to Amsterdam, the Hotel Agora isn't a bad choice - the staff are welcoming, the rooms are adequate and the location is ideal. ',POOR,
'Lovely situated hotel! We have just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam in the lovely hotel Agora! We really liked the hotel and its surroundings. We were surprised of the location; a lot of the famous museums are walking distance from the hotel and it is even situated on the Singel, one of the canals of Amsterdam. All the members of the staff were very friendly and cooperative. Due to the fact that it was our first time in Amsterdam, we had a lot of questions. Therefor the personell of Hotel Agora has given a lot of good advises for sightseeing in Amsterdam. We also appreciated the dutch breakfast in the morning, good service! ',GOOD,
'this place is knackered This is an uncomfortable hotel that's cold, ugly, shabby and very, very tired. Rooms are small, basic and cold, and breakfast is toast in a bland poky room. On our lasty night here we came home at around 1 am to find our door lock was faulty and we couldn't get into our room so we reported it to the night staff. We spent 4 hours in the lobby waiting while the staff organised a repair man to open the door. We were ignored by the staff as we waited. Eventually after 3 hours I found a member of staff and requested blankets to try and get warmed up in the lobby as we waited. Blankets were located after approx. 30 mins and they smelt disgusting. We finally got in to our room at 5:15 am. Thankfully this happened on our last night in this hotel that I was glad to leave. ',POOR,
'Nice, comfy and friendly       TV, Desk and Chair ',GOOD,
'I enjoyed I was looking for a hotel next to the singel canal as I knew it would be central to just about everything. This was my 5th stay in Amsterdam and I knew what to expect of the old converted canal houses.Yes, the Agora is a little tired looking now, but the service was really good and the staff friendly.My friend and I had the attic room . It was a lovely size and very clean. Due to all the hot weather of late, there was also a nice big fan in the room, which was much appreaciated.The bed linen was spotless, clean and crisp. The bathroom was also nice and clean. I too, also found a can of bug spray in the room, but with the windows open and being next to a canal i was happy to find it as there were plenty of gnats on the ceiling. We closed the windows, sprayed the room then went out for a walk. We had no problems (or insect bites) during our stay. I think some of the reviews are a little harsh, come on folks, this is a two star hotel!! I've stayed in worse four star hotels and paid a lot more.Plenty of steps to climb, but I did expect that. The breakfast was more than ample, typical dutch fare. and you could have as much as you wanted.Perhaps, a little expensive, but I did go in the height of the holiday season, so, that too was expected. Most of the hotels do special offers throughout the year, so you just have to watch out for them. All in all, myself and my friend enjoyed ourselves, and our stay at the Agora, and YES we would stay there again, it was very central, and quiet . One other thing, one of the staff did say that the hotel was having a refurbishment, probably this winter..so watch this space! ',POOR,
'Small and charcterful Stayed here in 1997, at that time rated hotel high. Stayed again in July 2006. On this visit some disappointment about slightly rundown now and not being kept in best condition, as evidenced in other comments here, but on balance still liked it and still several positive points.Location of hotel good. Better hotels tend to be further out, while the ones right in the centre are generally inferior budget ones.Stayed in room 35. Small attic room on top floor, rather cramped, and many quite steep stairs to reach it; but adequately warned about these points on website and when booking. Double bed, window with no view, very little storage space, but definitely a room with appealing character. Walls need some paint. Own private bathroom across corridor, ie not ensuite; obviously recently refurbished, good size, high standard, very clean, plenty of hot water, shower quite good. Electronic safe in room, no extra charge, good. Key cards to control access to both hotel and room.Mosquitoes and a noisy unit outside (a/c or similar) a problem the first night (unusually hot weather), so kept window closed subsequent nights.Staff efficient, helpful and friendly.Breakfast typical Dutch continental of various breads, jam, cheese, cold meat, eggs, and a few other supplies. Good coffee and orange juice. Served as help yourself buffet, not a vast spread, but quite good and sufficient for us. Breakfast room peaceful and quite spacious, better than many hotels. A few items not fresh on second morning, assume left over from previous day, otherwise a good and relaxing breakfast.Some parts of hotel need attention. Graffiti on outside an unwelcome start. Stair carpet in poor condition, and distinct musty smell on lower stairs, as noticed by everyone else on this website. Repainting some walls would be a significant, and cheap, enhancement.Paid 92 Euros per night, which is reasonable for Amsterdam (although 88 Euros posted in room ?). Larger ensuite rooms around 120 Euros, 140 euros for view of canal. Booking dealt with efficiently by email, cancellation available up to 48 hours before arrival.In summary: Needs some refurbishment - new carpets and some paint, and ensure everything at breakfast is fresh. Otherwise, still an attractive hotel with character, good value, good location, a typical Amsterdam house rather than a bland hotel. (Other than spending a lot more money elsewhere) we would probably stay here again.Martin  Sally ',POOR,
'Good Location that's about it. This is a hotel that has seen better times. The location is great, close to everything and right on the Singel canal. However, the lobby is a good clue that the Agora is getting tired to say the least. The furnishings are old and the walls need a paint job. When you are ready to go up the stairs from the lobby, a strange smell greets your nostrals. Not pleasant. The rooms are ok, the showers could use a good cleaning, but our room had a nice view of the canal.There is a disco next store and on a Friday and Saturday night the pounding of the music beat goes until 4am. Unless you sleep though anything, this will be a problem.The staff is friendly, but the breakfest is skimpy. It seemed like I needed to ask for basic food stuff every morning, like juice and coffee.It's too bad that I can't give this hotel a good review, if the owners of this hotel tried, this could be a very nice and cozy place to stay. ',POOR,
'Great location, somewhat odd hotel Wonderfully friendly staff and great location makes up for somewhat decayed state of furnishings and especially carpet. We settled on funky as the best description of it - very steep stairs with weird angles, quite decent sized rooms with better than average bathrooms, reasonable breakfasts, but on the verge of run-down. ',POOR,
'Great Location Too bad the hotel does not live up to the website. It was dirty everywhere, from soilded carpets to worn walls and doors to large amounts of mold in the shower. The staff was friendly but inexperienced and could not give basic tour information or get a taxi for us. The complimentary breakfast was pathetic and you are better to pay for something at a cafe nearby. The bed was hard and difficult to sleep on.The location was ideal near the Leidesplein and a tram stop. This was the cheapest canal house with a water view I was able to find. But at $135 Euro a night I expected a basic level that was not there. ',POOR,
'Checked in and Checked Back Out!       Grafitti on outside ',POOR,
'Horrible Hotel This hotel is not worth the money. Stayed there three terrible nights. The beds were horrible - might as well been trying to sleep in a hammock. The room stank of smoke, and most of our neighbors stayed in their rooms smoking pot all day, which is their right, but the smoke filled the halls and all the rooms on the floor. There are no non smoking rooms. On a scary note, the fire escape stairs aren't finished, and they're made of wood. That seems like a bad idea. The location is good, but for 120 Euro, you can find better places. I will never stay there again. ',POOR,
'Hotel Agora- Not recommended Stayed at Hotel Agora on my eighth visit to A'dam. Have stayed in many hotels there and do not consider myself to be a nit- picky person. However, I have to agree with the sentiments of those who previously posted- sewage smell in the stairway, mold in the bathroom, etc. Breakfast was skimpy- on my first day there they ran out of boiled eggs. The staff was pleasant enough, but for the money you could do better elsewhere. The best thing about it was the location- everything very walkable from this hotel. Still, my advice is that you could do much better elsewhere for the same price or less. Keep looking before you settle for this hotel. ',POOR,
'Outstanding Location       Outside - a little shaby ',GOOD,
'Terrible hotel, despite the location This is in many ways a terrible hotel. Prepare to be disappointed - I know I was. Imagaine going back to the 60s - and you'll find the rooms haven't been touched since. The worst is the carpets - absolutely filthy. Old furniture, beds that sag - and worst of all, mould in the bathrooms. Sure, the place is in the centre of everything, and the 4 rooms at the front with windows over the Singel canal have a great view - but don't turn round and look at the dump you are staying in. The rooms are tiny. I gave up after one night, after finding there was no hot water, and my TV had no reception. No, none at all, of any picture! This place isn't particularly cheap either, and there are much better hotels just over the road. My view - avoid. ',POOR,
'Great Hotel, Great Location My wife sent me and my best friend to Amsterdam for a week for my 40th birthday (Thanks honey!) and after much research, I booked a room at the Agora. We were not disapointed. Our room faced the Singel Canal and featured a modern bathroom with a shower. The room was clean and came with a security card-operated safe perfect for storing passports and valuables. The security card also opened the front door, the door leading to the upper floors and the room itself. We felt very safe. Breakfast as noted in other reviews was delicious and filling. The coffee was especially exceptional. The Agora is very centrally located to the flower market, the museums and the nightlife of the Leidseplein. There are many pubs (including a great single malt scotch bar) and restaurants nearby and if you have any questions about what to do or see, the owners are very friendly and eager to answer all your questions. The only concerns you might want to consider are the steps - they are numerous and steep. Don't forget, you are staying in a Dutch canal house... I would consider asking about a ground floor room if you have bad knees or vertigo. Also, the hotel is located on a major intersection (the Koningsplein) where the trams take a hard left from Leidsestraat then a right on up the Spui. While I found the ringing of tram bells and general street noise charming and a welcome change from the everyday, those who prefer a less frenetic atmosphere might want a Garden view room. A note to westerners - this is not a Holiday Inn. If you are expecting a large room with every possible amenity, look elsewhere. If however, you want to experience staying in the intimate setting of a canal house in a great part of town for a very attractive price, I would highly recommend The Agora. ',GOOD,
'splendid hotel We, a family group of six aged 12 to 56, stayed at the Agora for 4 nights - and enjoyed our stay very much. Perfect location close to many interisting places, locations and restaurants. Nice and quiet rooms, good beds, recently renovated bathrooms. Delicious breakfast buffet in cozy room. The hotel is clean, safe and quiet. The staff are kind and helpful. Good quality for money - we will definitely stay at the Agora next time in Amsterdam ',GOOD,
'awesome!       bathroom ',GOOD,
'Bad Taste My husband and myself stayed at the Agora Hotel during May this year (2005). Apart from the fact that the hotel is centrally situated within walking distance to all major attractions and a relative, good enough breakfast, there is nothing positive that we can say about the hotel.Firstly when you are in the foyer of the hotel a sewerage smell hangs in the air, secondly the furbishment of the room dated from the 1960's, the carpet was disgustingly filfy and the room had a terrible smell of cigarette smoke. (We are smokers ourselves). The bedding, specially the mattresses are disgusting and it is obvious that the owners do not plough any capital back into upgrading the facilities. The Agora Hotel will be a definite NO for us to visit again. We have travelled a lot, we are not fussy people but the Agora Hotel was a terrible mistake for us to have stayed in during our visit to lovely AmsterdamAlba Moolman, Cape Town, South Africa ',POOR,
'Loved the Agora We (3 females) stayed at the Hotel Agora, Amsterdam from May 8-14, 2005, and loved the hotel. It is in a GREAT location - 15 min. walk north to Dam Square (up a great shopping street) and 15 min. walk south to the museums (down a great shopping street). The room was quite adequate for the price, with a brand new bathroom. It was very clean, safe and quiet. The breakfast buffet (which was included in the price) was very good -- cereals, breads, boiled eggs, cheese, cold cuts, tea, coffee  orange juice. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel for the great price, location and hospitality.Transportation tip - buy a round trip Connexion bus shuttel ticket at the airport which takes you from the airport to the hotel and back (about 18 euros return). The bus conveniently stops 2 blocks from the hotel - but make sure you tell the driver it's Hotel Ahora (Dutch pronunciation of Agora) and even show the driver the name and address of the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Ideal location, clean, comfortable, inexpensive I was returning from a conference and stayed in Hotel Agora to explore Amsterdam for three days. My room was at the top of the stairs, so I had a good workout. By the end of three days, I could run up easily and I did often. I did not have to carry my suitcase because the owner carried it up himself.Agora was ideal for a single woman staying in Amsterdam. The front door has a key lock, the door to the stairs has a key lock, the room has a key lock. I never felt more safe. The staff was very nice and spoke English and French. The best part of the hotel was the location. So close to everything and anything - shops, restaurants, flowers. The first day I walked to the Rijksmuseum because I couldn't figure out the trams (which are very easy). Agora's proximity to many interesting places and its affordable rooms make it my first choice upon any return trips (and I hope to soon.) ',GOOD,
'Very friendly.good location Just back from Hotel Agora - good value, well located hotel on the Singel Canal next to the floating flower market. Friendly, informative staff. Rooms at the front look over canal - double glazing and dark curtains so you get a good night's sleep. Rooms at back look over a pretty courtyard garden. ',GOOD,
'Nice Hotel in a semi central location This Hotel attracted me thru its reviews and price. The location was a few doors down from the main road thru town, but quiet. Transportation was easy, A variety of restaurants were nearby for dinner, and the hotel serves a nice breakfast in a nice setting. ',GOOD,
'Great location, olde worlde charm We stayed at the Agora Hotel in Amsterdam from the 6th to 9th January 05. It is on the Singel Canal, within minutes of the Flower Market. My husband and I and our 13 year old had Room 32, a Triple facing the Canal. The outlook is lovely, specially at night, with the canal and street lit up. Being winter, we had the windows opened only a few inches for fresh air, so the noise of the nearby Trams did not bother us, but it could be different in summer. I think the ambience more than makes up for any background noise.  The room had a double bed (two singles pushed together) and a single. The bathroom is a bit small for three, but recently renovated and everything is clean. Towels were changed everyday. There is a shower only.  The room smelt strongly of smoke when we came in, but this is a problem I think one encounters everywhere in this city. We got some air freshener from the Management and left the windows open for a while and that helped.  Breakfast, which was included, was good. Cereal, juice, beautiful breads, toast and spreads, hard boiled eggs, some typical Dutch sweet cookies/toast, tea/coffee. The breakfast room was obviously the living room of the previous owners and is furnished with some lovely Dutch pieces, very comfortable and relaxing.  The Managers/Owners, Els and Yvo, and their staff, all speak English, are friendly and extremely helpful with suggestions and directions. They called a Taxi to take us to Central Station on our departure and it arrived in a matter of minutes.  The only drawback of the Agora is the steep, narrow stairs to the upper levels. We had to drag three big suitcases to our room and it was not easy. All Canal house hotels must have this problem, but be forewarned if you cannot manage steps.   There are many good restaurants within a short walk of the Hotel. we tried an Indonesian restaurant, that does Rijstaffel, it was excellent. All the sights are reached by a short tram ride or a brisk walk.  The biggest problem we encountered in Amsterdam was the amount of smokers in restaurants. There are few designated non smoking areas and some of these are in very close proximity to the smoking section. Ask, before you sit down, if this is as much of a bother to you, as it was to us.  Amsterdam can be very cloudy and windy. A good head scarf is invaluable, besides all the other cold weather gear.   We truly enjoyed our short stay in Amsterdam and the Agora did much towards that satisfied feeling. From what I have seen on the Web, it is one of the most reasonably priced Canal hotels. Enjoy !  ',GOOD,
'Good Hotel, Good Price, Great Location I agree with the reviewer from England that the person from the US is off the mark with comments about security. We stayed at the Agora during October 2004 and never felt the least bit unsafe. There is plenty of security, and we enjoyed our stay there. We had a canal-side room, and are thinking of getting a garden-side room when we go back, because there is quite a bit of street noise on the canal side. But at night we just plugged in the fan that was in the room and it drowned out most of the streetcar noise. And it was nice to look out the window and see the passers-by. At any rate, we found the Agora very comfortable, the staff was very nice, and the location is just great. We also liked the breakfast. There's plenty of choice with coffee, tea, toast, cereals, soft-boiled eggs, meats and cheeses. We'd stay there again without hesitation. ',POOR,
'Security The person from the USA who complained about security is way offtarget. The bedrooms are secure (three swipe cards) at least threecctv,s and staff on hand. The doors are secure, rooms have large safe's. ONLY THE CARELESS WOULD GET ROBBED, and the doors to the rooms are good and solid (fire reg's).Our bathroom was brand new, there were downsides but like forlike it was reasonable value for money, and very Central. Not thebest presented breakfast, or the best choice, but adequate, there is noneed to go hungary.GET IN THERE TO BE IN THE CENTRE FOR THE PRICE. ',POOR,
'Very comfortable beds! We stayed at the end of November 2004.Centrally situated, quiet at night, trams stop right near it. This hotel was excellent. The only slight complaint was that we are ex-smokers, and the room had obviously had a cigar smoker in it before us. Having said that, the room overlooking the canal on the first floor was warm, comfortable, quiet and had a great view.The stairs take a bit of negotiating, but are soon got used to. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Would highly recommend, and hope to return next year. Amsterdan and the canals are wonderful!It was so easy to get a train from Schipol, the station is below the airport. We had planned to get a taxi, but everything is so simple, we caught the train to Central Amsterdam, then got a tram outside the railway station (No. 1.2 or 5) to Konigsplien, to the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel November 25-28, 2004. My room was #35. The room was a bit small and the covers a bit threadbare. The room was slightly drafty, but o.k. (how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room?). The bathroom across the hall was EXCELLENT. Looks like it was just refinished. The room and bathroom were always clean. Breakfast was o.k. The staff were very nice and helped with any questions I had. There are many bars and restaurants in the area. Tram stop for trams 1, 2, and 5 are just around the corner. The hotel is very easy to get to from Central Station, and you can get to the the museum area, or any other destination very easily as well. The location of the hotel was very good. I felt safe at this hotel. FYI there is no elevator, so if you do not like stairs, you want want to find another hotel. This was my 3rd time to the city and I had a pleasant time. I would stay here again. kilmistr@hotmail.com ',GOOD,
'Charming, comfortable  We chose the Agora having read other reviews on this site and were happily not disappointed. We stayed for a 3-night stay, and, having arrived early were able to check into our room at 1030 am. Check in was friendly, speedy and efficient and secure, the room we had booked was a double with ensuite facilities we did not pay extra for canal view and as it was had a view of nearby offices, allowing plenty of people watching , the huge windows were screened by full length voile and long lined curtains. the room was of average size with a huge comfortable double bed, wardrobe with safe deposit box - at no additional cost - and bureau and chairs. The bathroom was modern and clean with a massive walk in shower dispensing hot water every time we used it. There was a hairdryer  shaver point and large soft white towels which were changed daily. We were situated on the 2nd floor and the stairs were quite steep but we soon became acclimitised to them. We found the hotel to be quiet at night times even allowing for its central location . The room was warmly heated and we were able to open the windows to allow additional ventilation. Buffet breakfast was available from 730-10 and there was a wide varied selection to choose from. The Singel is a very pretty canal and the location of the Agora is very handy for Spui , and the Flowermarket about 5mins. away ; the Leidesplein, Vondel Park and Dam square are about 10 mns. away and Red Light area and Station about 15-20 mins walk. There are lots of bars , cafes and a wide choice of varying eteries all close by. Just watch out on the walkways for the bikes ! ',GOOD,
'The Hotel Agora, Very unsafe, beware The rooms at the Hotel Agora are uncomfortable, there are no screens on the windows, no air conditioning and mosquitos are rampant at night. We were bitten from head to toe. If that wasn't enough, the doors on the rooms are made out of particle board, the locks are flimsy, front desk security is non-existent, and we were robbed! The Hotel did nothing to help us. Don't stay here; its' unsafe! ',POOR,
'Great place to stay First time I've stayed at the Agora but would definately stay there again. Staff helpful and welcoming, great location, very clean. Has the charm often lacking in chain hotels but retains the high standards.We stayed in the attic room - a long haul up the stairs but definately worth it! ',GOOD,
'Altogether OK July 2004: We arrived very early on our first day in Amsterdam from an all night transit from London. We were tired and the owner offered us some breakfast-even though we were not entitled to it on that morning. We thought that was nice, however, the owner and her assistant proceeded to talk about us in Dutch as we were only a few feet away eating (about how we were poor backpackers and had booked the cheapest room, what was she to do but give us breakfast etc-She offered the breakfast!) Not realising my husband is Dutch and he could understand everything, it was an embarrasing situation. We went to see the city and came back when our room was ready, the owner asked us where we were from etc and my husband spoke to her in Dutch, her face went red and that said it all. As for the room and location, that was all great, but our first experience tainted our stay and made us wonder if this happens with other guests who can't understand what's being said. We thought it was very unprofessional, rude and altogether uncalled for. Next time, we will stay somewhere else that will hopefully appreciate our choosing to stay at their establishment, not put us down. ',POOR,
'Nice Hotel I recently stayed at the Agora with my partner and found it very pleasant. The location, as other reviewers have said, is excellent with most attractions in walking distance, if not a tram stop is a stones throw away. The staff were friendly and helpful and we were made to feel welcome. Our room was of adequate size, nothing fancy, clean with a nice bathroom. A variety of food is provided for the self-service breakfast, including cereal, breads, cheese and ham. I personally found the same selection for breakfast a bit tedious after a few days but I'm sure it is adequate for most. All in all this is a very nice Hotel, I cannot think of anything bad about it!

'Wonderful as Billed - Outstanding Service The Sumner was a wise choice for a home away from home. The front desk staff (especially Mark and Beatta) could not have been more perfect. The hotel is nice building and is certainly centrally located. A recommendation for a restaurant (seafood just around the corner from the hotel) was excellent. We were always asked whether we wanted Tean and buscuits - which were either served in the parlor or our rooms. We took a 2 day trip to Zurich during our stay and the hotel was kind enough to work out an arrangement that was very convenient. Upon leaving - we had more heavy baggage than I care to admit - the young lady on duty provided a great deal of assistance with luggage that was larger than she was. I coukd go on and on - but I think you get the picture. Nice bathrooms - nice size rooms. Pretty common areas. We've found our new hotel in London and will return - Really this was a 4.5 rating - Karen and Gil (USA) ',GOOD,
'Lovely--Great Location We stayed at The Sumner for two nights in December. The location was great, convenient to many sights and restaurants. We set out walking at 11:00 a.m., after a wonderful complimentary breakfast , and we went to all of the sights that we had wanted to visit. We were back at the hotel by 7:00 p.m. after dinner. The staff was very accomodating and friendly. We will definitely stay at The Sumner when we are in London again. We will also recommend it to our friends. ',GOOD,
'"Well-known" hotels could learn a thing or two from this little gem! We stayed at The Sumner Hotel for one night in December and were very impressed by this small boutique hotel. I had booked a deLuxe double room on the first floor, which like the rest of the hotel, was spotless. Having stayed in many London hotels, I would recommend The Sumner, above any other, to both business and leisure travellers. It gets five stars from me for cleanliness, service, value and dining; it鈥檚 in a great location just off Marble Arch 鈥?and it鈥檚 lovely and quiet too! Some of the larger well-known hotels could learn a thing or two from this little gem. ',GOOD,
'Elegant home away from home Truly a jewel in London. On a side street, very quiet, the surroundings are at once historic and modern. Our room was spacious - very unusual for Europe - and tastefully decorated. The service was so discreet, you hardly knew anyone was working there, except that the room and the public areas were immaculate. Lots of careful detail - the living area, shared, had lovely soft music playing, a computer available, good reading material, and beautiful furniture. Also, terrific location, interesting neighborhoods, shopping and great walking. ',GOOD,
'Great Stay We stayed at the hotel for one evening but would happily recommend it to anyone else. Not too far from Kings Cross and easy to get to the Grosvenor Hotel for our function. Room nice with contempory furnishings and large which makes a pleasant change for London. Shower is compact but enough room to do what is necessary - shower. We were on the first floor and it did feel like a rabbit warren with lots of corridors and doors.Fantastic night sleep had. Thanks! ',GOOD,
'Lovely Hotel What a hotel!Located on a side street just a few minutes walk from Hyde Park Corner. You could almost miss the hotel and walk past it as it just looks like someone's house!We had a room at the back of the hotel - small but very very quiet for central London.The hotel is very well presented and very clean. Breakfast was included in the rate and was adequate (limited hot food but plenty of cold buffet).Overall a wonderful stay. ',GOOD,
'Ab Fab Hotel and Staff I stayed at the Sumner for 8 nights. I was impressed from the moment I stepped over the threshold. The location is ideal for shopping and transportation, the street is quiet, and the room was large by London standards. The hotel seems to be run very efficiently. Everything was spotlessly clean. Throughout the stay the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, and accommodated all our wishes without fuss and without error. Next time I visit London I shall definitely stay at the Sumner. ',GOOD,
'A great London find. Our stay totaled 4 nights and we were very comfortable and well cared for. The staff is incredibly helpful and pleasant. They can get you tickets to shows, explain the Tube, check opening and closing times of attractions. The hotel is spotlessly clean and our room was very quiet. We paid 112 pounds for 2 doubles with the Rick Steve's discount. Bathrooms were the best we encountered in Euorpe, plenty of hot water, and toilets that flushed, etc and good soaps and shampoos. The included breakfast was very nice, with excellent tea. The parlor/drawing room was pleasant and we even had a pot of tea there late one nite after trudging back thru a very cold and blustery snow storm! The free internet is great to print boarding passes or check reservations, tho the front desk will do all this for you. Its a great choice for a London hotel. The car service they book is excellent, on time, and curteous. We'd return. A great find! ',GOOD,
'great boutique hotel located in Marble Arch on a quiet streetconvenient for Tube, but not near attractionsquiet, clean, basic room and breakfast was basicbreakfast room was windowless which was not attractivevery helpful staffwould stay here again ',GOOD,
'A great find My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed a 2 night stay at The Sumner over Hallowe'en. The Hotel is clean, modern and easy to find, and the staff were friendly and efficient. It's very handy for Oxford st. and there are plenty of restaurants on Edgeware road which is a 1 min walk away. The only slight downside for me was the breakfast. it was ok, but not everyone likes bratfurst sausages, and they were the only cooked option other than eggs. It's really ony a minor criticism, though, as we'd definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'An excellent London option We booked the Sumner after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The hotel is well located - the tube is less than 5 minutes away - the Oxford Street shops - the same.We booked a King Double, which was larger than the average London hotel room. It had a pleasant view over the street and the double glazing ensured there was no street noise.The staff were very helpful. The breakfast was generous and while it is described as continental it includes hot and cold food and was more than enough for us. Within a 5 minute radius were some very interesting pubs and restaurants. On the ground floor is a very comfortable guest area with a free internet connection. London is an expensive city by any standards, but we felt we received comparative value for money from the Sumner. We were more than pleased and have booked to stay there again next year. ',GOOD,
'Highly Recommended This is a top quality small boutique hotel in an EXCELLENT location. It is only a 2 min walk to Oxford St and Marble Arch and a 5 min walk into Hyde Park.The decor is really tasteful and modern and we were really impressed with the lounge area which had lots of lovely reading material and more importantly, a PC for guest use FREE OF CHARGE to surf the web. We had drinks in the lounge one evening and although they were a little pricey, it was a lovely atmosphere.We had an executive king sized room which was immaculate, with high quality fittings and fixtures and plenty of space. It overlooked the street but wasn't noisy at all and it was nice to be able to open the windows. (In many hotels we find that's not possible!)We didn't really need specific help from staff but we found them pleasant at all times. When we asked to borrow an ironing board - it was no trouble at all.Although we would recommend this hotel and would stay again, it did have some small down sides for us. Firstly, there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which I would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to pay 拢3.60 for tea for two with biscuits! Also, I like to have a bath and robe in a hotel room, especially after a hard day's sight seeing in London but unfortunately, we had neither. The shower room was like new and very clean but quite small.As for the breakfast, it was more continental than traditional English. The first day, there was no bacon at all and the sausage was like a bratwerst! On day 2, we did have bacon but no sausage. Toast wasn't readily available on the buffet but we did get some when we asked. Despite these small niggles, we thorougly enjoyed our stay. ',GOOD,
'wonderful choice The Sumner was a perfect choice for comfort, location and service and the price with the the Rick Steves discount was excellent. We had a standard room which was in the back which was very quiet and of a good size. The many buses that serve the area are terrific for a first time visitor and good for sightseeing as well as getting where you want to go.The tube is good if you are in a hurry if the lines are working properly. We found good restaurants nearby - Prezzo and the Spaghetti House. The prepared food at Marks and Spencers is as good as all our London friends been telling us. The Sumner staff were always pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was more than ample. Having tea served in our room or the lounge at any time of day or night really was wonderful especially after a long day of touring. ',GOOD,
'outstanding hotel What a magnificent little jewel. We loved the Sumner and the service was outstanding. We could absolutely not ask for more! This hotel is warm, charming and beautiful. Our room was very spacious and well equipped, the attention to detail was evident throughout the hotel. We felt so at home we did not want to leave. It is spotless, and the breakfast was lovely with many choices. The location was superb and very handy to many conveniences. You will not find anything like it for the very affordable price charged. We cannot say enough about this hotel and will certainly stay there the next time we are in London. We have already recommended it to many friends in Canada. Mark was awesome and Peter was wonderful, they were so kind and helpful it made our stay enjoyable. It has internet available for use 24hours. The bathroom was also very comfortable and spacious. Many thanks to the owners for caring so much, it shows! Sincerely, David and Marcella Abugov, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada ',GOOD,
'Very Enjoyable Stay at the Sumner Spent one night at the Sumner in London on our way back home from Europe trip. The room, a deluxe, was delightful - surprisingly large and airy for a London hotel. It is very well fitted out with a wonderful comfortable bed and the bathroom was well accomodated too. Breakfast was included in the rate, which also was surprisingly reasonable by London standards, and the breakfast fare was very good.Also enjoyed the comfortable and large guest lounge and really appreciated having a dedicated guest computer with free internet access.Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Sumner Hotel.       Enjoy the fresh air in Hyde Park ',GOOD,
'Loved this hotel This hotel was one of the best I've stayed in on my last several trips to Europe. The location is great, a sort of quiet area but close to everything plus the Marble Arch underground is only a few blocks away. The staff were extremely curteous and the room was fairly big as far as European standards go. It was very clean, had free internet service in the lobby level, and the hot breakfast which was included I thought was superb. The beds were fairly comfortable as well which is a rarity in most hotels I've stayed. For the price this hotel was a great deal and I for sure would come back. ',GOOD,
'fantastic location September 4thWe spent 3 night at the Sumner and would book there again.The staff were professional and helpful. Our room was large for European standards, big king size bed.Everything was clean and well cared for.The breakfasts were substantial, containing hot and cold items.We could walk to Oxford street and explore alot of the city on foot from this location. Great little pub next door. ',GOOD,
'Incredible London Value Contacted the Sumner after reading all the excellent Trip Advisor reviews. Right away I knew we had made the right choice because of the efficient, courteous and professional manner in which they corresponded with us.We stayed 5 wonderful nights in a spacious and most comfortable king room. The driver and car we requested was right there to meet us after customs at Heathrow and take us to the hotel. The location was great...it took us about 3 minutes to walk to the Marble Arch Tube Station. (If you are going to ride the tube quite a bit as we did, I suggest purchasing Oyster Cards before you go. They reduce the fare for each ride per person from 4 pounds to 1 1/2 pounds. You can purchase them online from the Visit Britain website). There are several restaurants within two to six blocks of the hotel...I would recommend Prezzo and Seaport...they were both excellent...Prezzo very reasonably priced and Seaport a little expensive but well worth it. You are also only two blocks from beautiful Hyde Park, where you can walk forever.We paid 145 pounds per night and besides the lovely room, that also included a very nice breakfast with both hot and cold items, Wi-Fi in the room, a computer with internet access in the lobby, room service at anytime for tea or coffee, and the assistance of one of the most helpful staffs we have encountered anywhere in the world for absolutely anything. You can pay twice that in London and get a tiny room with a cold breakfast in a not so good location and then have to pay extra for computer access.The bathroom had a shower only, which we prefer, with fantastic water pressure, instant hot water, nice toiletries and soft, fluffy towels. The room had both heat and AC, both of which you could adjust to suit you. We had two floor to ceiling 12ft high windows, which you could open, but when closed you could not hear the street traffic.I can't imagine a more pefect place to stay in London..we will definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'The Sumner was lovely Had a lovely 5 day stay starting with a car pick up at the Heathrow that the hotel arranged for us which was fantastic as London greeted with pouring rain ! Had a king room on the top floor which was a great size and 130 GB per night was a good price. Lovley furnitures, manchster and wall mounted flat screen. An extra bonus was the windows open so fresh air can come in ! The staff were helpful, the breakfast (included) was great (met some nice people) and having a free computer in the lounge was great for checking emails. Location was the best. Great Middle Eastern supermarket down the road, restaurants near by, can walk to the tube and we even walked acorss Hyde park to Harrods !(My tiny little concern was that the shower was claustrophobic as the door nearly goes to ceiling heigth and the steam engulfs you however open the door a little gulp air and off you go again ( a bath would have been nice but no room). The heating of the room was questionable (we expressed our concern and a staff member felt the cold air blowing out) as the reverse cycle only blows cool air not hot too and the wall heaters are controlled elsewhere.Lovely blankets were forthcoming but should not have been needed)However these are meant to be minute comments and we loved the place and without a doubt we would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'The Sumner is the place to stay in London If you're looking for super value, incredible service and great accommodations in London, this is the place. My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Sumner and the staff was simply fabulous in helping out with our needs, from theater tickets to directions. The gentleman at the front desk who greeted us, Mark, made us feel very welcome. The room was super clean and comfortable. Also very close to an Underground station where you can go anywhere in London and beyond. Great breakfast every morning, except they close a bit early (no biggie). Even offered to have breakfast ready on the morning we left. Next time, we're in London, the Sumner will surely be our hotel destination. Our only complaint is that we could not find good nearby pubs after our late nights on the town but we never inquired with the Sumner staff. ',GOOD,
'We loved it here! We stayed here for four nights in a regular room and we would go back in a heartbeat! Comfortable room, nice breakfast, friendly staff and a great location - not to mention a reasonable rate for London. We will definetly recommend the Sumner to our friends and family.Dova and Kacee Jones ',GOOD,
'Would have been great except for the cold shower I stayed here for 2 nights in a King room. Everything was great except for the lack of hot water one morning. Given the rave reviews on this site for the hotel, I believe this was an isolated incident, but it does make it difficult for me to want to stay there again, especially as it caused me a lot of inconvenience  the staff provided no apology. Yes, London hotel rooms are very expensive  this hotel is practically a bargain in that context, but for US$320/night I would at least expect hot water when I need it.My room was on the 3rd floor, spacious, well lit with 2 windows overlooking the street,  quiet. The bed was incredibly comfortable, with very soft sheets. There were many cable channels available on the flat screen TV. The main downside was the bathroom - tiny, with a tiny stall shower. One morning, I found there was no hot water; 5 minutes after I called down to reception, I was told that one of the boilers had been turned off but had now been turned back on. I waited 20 minutes for the water to heat up  couldn't wait any longer, as at that point I was already 30 minutes late for my appointment. So I took a barely lukewarm shower. No apologies from reception.The hotel's public areas are very nicely decorated, in a stylish, muted fashion, with a comfortable drawing room. The staff was nice if a bit stiff. The location is great if you need to be near Marble Arch or Oxford St; the street itself is nice  quiet. The room key also opens the front door, which is very convenient but also feels secure. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as an alternative to a big hotel. My only (significant) problem was with the hot water. ',POOR,
'Very nice option Finding a hotel that is reasonably priced in London is incredibly difficult. There seem to be either very expensive or inexpensive yet sketchy hotels. The Sumner is moderately priced by very expensive London standards and is nicely located near the Marble Arch tube station. The hotel is located on a quiet street full of hotels that don't look nearly as nice as The Sumner. The hotel itself is well-appointed with comfortable rooms, a friendly staff and complementary breakfast. The room was spotless, quite large, and relatively quiet. The pros of the hotel are: it feels like (and is) a higher end boutique hotel, great location, reasonable room rate, staff, clean and modern rooms. I would definitely stay at The Sumner on a return visit. ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel In Marble Arch I am a business traveller who visits London about 4 time every year. I always stay near the marble arch. I have tried several hotels in the area. Most are noisy, overpriced with tiny rooms and indifferent service. I was looking to change so I found the Sumner reviews on this website and booked my most recent trip for 3 days. The location is excellent. 3 minute walk to marble arch tube. My room (King) was in a word - massive. I travel extensively all over the world and this is one of the biggest rooms I have ever had. Similarly the bathroom was very large.The Furniture and accessories were all top notch. The staff and service was great. The Breakfast did not feature a massive selection but was good quality and totally acceptable. Wifi was free.I will definitely be back. ',GOOD,
'Exceptional This is an outstanding hotel and I can't recommend it highly enough. The hotel is impeccable clean and the staff are falling over themselves being helpful and courteous. Despite other reviewers comments that the rooms were small, I found mine to be quite spacious for London. It is situated just a few blocks from Hyde Park with easy access to the tube and Oxford Street, so the location is excellent. There is a laundromat around the corner and a gym only five to ten minutes away. Internet use is free on the computer in the lounge and there is a library of London guides for your research. The breakfast was fantastic and overall The Sumner is the very best hotel I have ever used. ',GOOD,
'London in Sumner Recently stayed in the Sumner, following great reviews on Trip advisor. We were not disappointed! The staff were very friendly and the location is fantastic.We will definately go back. the only slight downside is that the breakfast is all pre cooked but there is a great deli just around the corner which just adds to the whole experience! ',GOOD,
'Great little hotel Very comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Bed and pillows excellent (Very important for me). Breakfast very filling. Hotel is spotless. Have booked a return visit. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'Loved the sumner! I stayed here with my parents end June 2008, stayed for 5 days. We had requested for a triple room and they got us a basement room - big enough for 3 of us. Tho initially when we saw we were placed next to the bfast room, we were worried bout the noise, but it was perfect.Which brings me to bfast - fabulous and delicious - eggs (2 types), sausages, baked beans, bacon - all very well cooked, plus a small selection of cereal, cheese and breads.The hotel itself is lovely, and the use of the free internet available 24/7 was much appreciated.Location is fantastic, just 5 mins walk to Marble Arch, with nearby grocers, small cafes and resturants if we're feeling lazy to venture more than 10mins beyond the hotel to have a bite. ',GOOD,
'Recent Stay Just returned from a seven nights stay at this hotel, located on Upper Berkeley Street in the Mayfair section of London. The hotel has only about sixteen rooms and the charges are relatively reasonable (for London). Our room was very comfortable with two twin beds - mattress was quite firm and needed some duvet underlay for my wife. Wi-fi was readily available and free computed access in the lounge was very helpful. The airconditioning worked fine in our room although the fan speed was difficult to control and led to some chilly mornings! The staff was uniformly helpful and excellent. They responded immediately to meet our needs for extra towels, an additional duvet, etc. They readily provided directions, reserved restaurants and called for taxis when needed. Two negative observations: In spite of promised morning newspapers, only a few were available in the lounge and they soon disappeared when guests took them to their rooms. The second, more serious criticism was the poor breakfast choices in the downstairs dining room. Included in the room charge, breakfast included juices, coffee or tea, cereals, fruits, rolls and hot dishes. The latter included either bacon or sausages, baked beans and two kinds of eggs - scrambled or hard boiled. Unfortunately, the hot dishes were not well prepared and also quite lukewarm or cold. Breakfast was only served from 8 AM to 9:30 AM.A final, very positive, aspect of the hotel is its location. It is only a block away from Edgeware Road and three blocks away from Marble Arch, so tube and bus services were readily accessible.The predominant Middle East population in the area provided easy market shopping and some fine Lebanese or Moroccan restaurants. However, our greatest meal in the neighborhood was in Porte des Indes, a fantastically decorated Indian restaurant with marvellous dishes. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic London accommodation! We stayed in the Sumner for 5 nights. The hotel was an old building that had been revamped but still kept its charm. There was a great sitting room with an open fire with books to read or just a place to catch up with friends which was great!There was also free internet access. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They also had their own printed travel booklet which had fantastic info on sights to see and surrounding restaurants, even a map of the shop locations on Oxford street.The breakfast was an added bonus in the morning. It was close to transport and laundry facilities. The rooms themselves were a bit small, but they were suitable for us. The room and bathroom were modern, comfortable and clean.The Sumner is fantastic value for money! I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, and in fact we will stay there again in the near future! ',GOOD,
'Great place! My husband and I stayed at the Sumner for three nights in July 2008. We had booked a King Room through the hotel's website (very user-friendly!) and stayed in Room 205. Out of all the many different hotels we have known in London over the years, the Sumner is easily the best. The location is very convenient for public transport (busses and the Underground from Marble Arch), shopping on Oxford street, and the lovely Hyde Park is just five minutes walk away. A taxi to Paddington Station is relatively cheap (as far as anything is in London) and fast, and from there it's an easy ride to Heathrow Airport on the Express train. Certainly an improvement to the slow ride on the Underground. The area around Marble Arch seems to be firmly in Middle Eastern hands now and there were lots of nice restaurants and excellent caf茅s just around the corner from the hotel. There's also a pub and some small supermarkets.The hotel is very clean and our room was spacious (for London standards). Small bathroom but plenty of fluffy fresh towels and a good powerful shower (by any standards). Our room looked out the front and traffic noise could be heard, so despite the double- glasing it was not as quiet as I had hoped for. Unfortunately, the A/C was right beside the bed and I was a bit bothered by the cold air blowing straight at us. We had very good wireless internet connection in our room and loved the fact that they had three different kinds of socket (UK, Europe, US) actually fitted in the wall by the desk. Why don't other hotels think of that kind of thing? The breakfast buffet should suit most tastes, good continental selection (and fresh fruit!) as well as the traditional cooked breakfast. Nice selection of breads too. The breakfast room is downstairs though and has no daylight or views, so you don't tend to linger.But what really makes this hotel is the friendly, well-trained and highly efficient staff. Everyone seems to be from Poland (no wonder, since the owner is apparently Polish) and they can't do enough for you. A very refreshing change from the attitude you meet elsewhere in the UK. Well done!There are cheaper places to stay but this hotel is excellent value for the money you pay, and if it's the Marble Arch area you want to stay in (or you're not bothered where you are), I would definitely look no further. ',GOOD,
'Mom and I LOVED this Hotel My mother and I (28 yo) were just in London for a week to visit family and spent a lot of time researching affordable/nice hotels online. The Sumner was fabulous and the hotel actually looks like the pictures on the website(s) and is everything it boasts. There is even free internet in the lobby (that was generally available when we wanted it)We liked the room*** and it was very clean, and was the size we expected (not US hotel room big, but European hotel room size) There was definitely enough room for both of us and the bathroom was appropriately sized and very clean, with an overhead shower option (as opposed to hand held). Also there was A/C that we could control and a nice window. The bed was comfortable and there was a flat screen TV. There was no safe in the room, but the hotel had one in which to leave your passports. There was a small frig in the room, with room to leave a few of your own items, e.g., mom and I kept a bottle of wine. The location was also great: I ran every morning in Hyde Park and the area had many restaurants and local eateries, as well as was very close to major sites (hyde park, Marylebone, buckingham is less than a mile, and kensington is just across the park) and tube lines/bus stops are also close. However, I would suggest getting local street map (the hotel does not have) because I'm pretty sure we took the tube when we could have walked and we had to switch tube lines a lot, if we walked we could have eliminated most changes. The hotel staff was very helpful and even looked up some BYO places for us in the neighborhood for dinner. Breakfast was totally convenient and the coffee was delicious. Mom and I are not a big morning eaters, so I can't comment on the eggs, etc but they had bananas and cereals which was perfect for both my mom and I and a nice bread, yogurt and apple/orange selection. Overall it was a GREAT stay!***I would suggest requesting a room that is NOT on the floor with breakfast, I would imagine it would get very loud during breakfast hours and the breakfast smells tend to waft. Our room was not near breakfast, so I can't say for sure. ',GOOD,
'Every thing We hoped It Would be and more My husband and I just got back from a Tour of Italy and spent our last night before returing to Canada in London at the Sumner Hotel. I researched many hotels before I booked and choose the Sumner based on the good reviews on Trip Advisor and other sites. We were certainly not dissapointed. We were only spending 24 hours in London and this hotel was in a wonderful location. We took the express train from Heathrow to Paddington Station, a quick taxi ride and we were at the Sumner- checking in before noon was no problem. A short walk away was Oxford Street shopping,Marble Arch and Hyde Park where we caught the hop on hop off buses for a tour of London. Dinner was eaten at Mason's pub on the corner- great fish and chips. The room was wonderful -large and modern, spotless with a comfy bed and linens. Our room was in the front and very quiet we never heard other guests or street traffic. The bath was clean and modern, not huge but adequate with a box shower.My husband thought the breakfast was the best yet, it certainly had a nice variety in pleasant suroundings.The staff was very helpful and polite and let us leave our luggage in reception to pick up for our afternoon flight.When we return to London we will certainly stay at the Sumner and will recommend it to all our friends. ',GOOD,
'Compact but lovely The Sumner was very clean, bright and comfortable. The beds were amazing and the hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was very small but the amazing bed made up for the small room size. Great location and 2 pubs and a laundromat right around the corner. ',GOOD,
'Felt like home away from home I spent 4 days here while on a business trip and was extremely pleased with the accommodations and amenities. I booked this based on the positive reviews on Trip Advisor and the price (reasonable for London and the quality of the rooms) After a long day of work and running around, it was a pleasure to come back to a comfortable, spacious, and immaculate room and relax. The choice of breakfast foods was wide and everything was absolutely delicious, including the coffee (not alway the best at hotel restaurants) The decor of the hotel from the rooms to the lounge area was smart and stylish without being pretentious or overly modern. The location is only a few blocks from Marble Arch and Oxford Street but away from the crowds - I genuinely felt that I was coming back to a neighborhood despite several other small hotels and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. I had hoped to try the pub on the corner or the fish restaurant around the block, but only managed to get to one of the several Lebanese restaurants on nearby Edgware Road.All in all, I hope to return the next time I am in London for business or pleasure. ',GOOD,
'Solid, Quiet Hotel The Sumner is a small, quiet hotel 2 or 3 blocks north of the Marble Arch tube stop. While it is not in the shadow of the Tower or Whitehall, I thought it was well-located, with the quiet street more than offsetting an extra 3 or 5 minutes by cab.Rooms clean and quiet. Helpful, non-intrusive staff. Good breakfast (cereals, coffee, juice, sausage, eggs, toast) included. Rooms are smallish, but fine. One computer in the sitting room for internet access / EMails. I never stayed on it for more than 5 minutes: internet access was no problem.IMO, the only reason to NOT stay here is if you wanted to walk to night-time entertainment (e.g., theaters). If you're happy flagging cabs after dark, then the Sumner is your place for all of London. ',GOOD,
'Perfect!!! Just everything you need: perfect room, friendly staff, bathroabs and sleepers in your room, nice linen and very comfortable beds. And yes, it's a very quiet place. Would certainly stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Superb hotel and staff. A superb hotel with exceptional staff. Great location close to shopping and easy access to the underground. We appreciated the warm and sincere welcome of staff and the immaculate room. Staff were also of great help before we arrived making show reservations and generally getting us organized.An added bonus is the quiet location just off the beaten path. Makes for restful sleep with little road noise. Exceptional value for a good quality London Hotel. We will certainly be back. ',GOOD,
'Good Boutique Hotel We stayed at this hotel at the end of May 2008, using it as a base for a theatre weekend break.We were given a bedroom at the front of the hotel with smart furniture and comfortable beds. The en-suite was compact, with a shower, (no bath) but it was all very clean and tidy.Although the overall impression of the hotel was very good, there were a number of minor disappointments which I have described below:- There weren鈥檛 any tea  coffee facilities in bedrooms.Although the food at breakfast was very enjoyable, the majority of tables in the basement breakfast room (apart from one long table) only seated two people, which didn't help as there were three of us and the girl serving tried to seat us at tables on different sides of the room!Although impressed by the general appearance and quality of the hotel, I was expecting more of a 鈥渨ow鈥?factor for a London hotel ranked as No 8 on Tripadvisor.Please note that if you are booking online, there appears to be two websites. The main site is www.thesumner.com, but an alternative site www.londonsumnerhotel.co.uk gives discounted room rates!Overall, a very nice hotel in easy walking distance of Marble Arch and Oxford Street with pleasant and helpful staff on the check-in desk. However, I am not convinced it is good value for money, although I would definitely use it again if I could get a discounted rate! ',GOOD,
'Stylish hotel in great location Good clean hotel with boutique style -great location 5 mins walk from Marble Arch. Stayed in room 107 which is on third floor front facing Upper Berkeley Street . Two nights bed  breakfast cost 拢340 in king room- shower only -no bath. Original sash windows with secondary glazing kept out the worst of the traffic noise - my husband tells me I slept through a thunderstorm so street sound wasnt a problem.Lounge area was very welcoming - the whole Hotel had an ambience of staying with a well healed friend with an eye for detail.The breakfast room was in the basement and part self service style. Tea  Toast was brought to your table  you could help yourself to cereals,continental style ham  cheeses, crossants,preserves, juice,scrambled  poached egg,sausage  beans - dont think I missed anything... Breakfast area could have done with some more air conditioning as no windowsWe read in an earlier review that the poached eggs were like bullets - yes they were more like boiled eggs but the scrambled was perfect!London itself was busy as half term holidays - avoid Oxford Street if you can. Take in Regents Park, take tea at the Ritz (book in advance  wear shirt  tie)  have a stroll round Fortnum  Mason  the old victorian arcades of Picadilly - we walked to all these areas from the Hotel.Go in The Sherlock Holmes Museum Baker Street and have a laugh at the letters he still gets.The hotel kept a list of local restaurants with 15 minutes walking distance which was a welcome nice touch.Thoroughly recomend Hotel  would stay again - maybe next time they would have tea  coffee making facilities in room ',GOOD,
'Incredible Boutique Hotel I was in London for a job fair which was located in Central London.As usual, central London is not a cheap place to stay and the less expensive places are not available on short notice.The Sumner is more affordable than many of the hotels in that area and is a real treat. It is clean, professional, and classy. It was very quiet and accessible to everything. The tube is only a couple blocks away.It is a perfect boutique hotel. Not nearly as pretentious as the hotel down the street where my job fair was located. :) ',GOOD,
'Great London Digs Booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. Completley happy and have stayed in many European hotels which have been more expensive with less comfort.Hotel great to deal with via e-mail prior to stay- prompt replies. Quiet room,small but adequate, aware was London . Great air con, lift. Could not beat location- Oxford St, Hyde Park, shopping, V and A museum plus Tube station and more all within easy walking plus good range of restaurants/pubs.Staff great, breakfast above average for Europe- we usually don't eat breakfast in the hotel.Big tick for the Sumner ',GOOD,
'Warm and Friendly - My Favorite Hotel Experience Yet We stayed at the Sumner Hotel in March while visiting our daughter who is currently attending LSE. Our room was terrific, the breakfast were delicious, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The last night of our stay, they moved a bed into our room so our daughter could stay with us -- all free of charge. This is perhaps one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!Casey Malcolm - Devon, PA ',GOOD,
'Would stay again Having read the reviews on here, we decided to stay at the Sumner for 3 nights in April. We were not disappointed. We had a front room on the 3rd. Good size room, the bathroom was a little small but it is London. The only noise we heard was from the pub down the road late at night on the weekend.The breakfast was great, fresh and slight changes each day.Bed was very comfortable.WIFI worked great, better than hotels were you have to pay for it.Great location, easy walk to Oxford Street. Staff were friendly but you didn't see much of them. Felt very safe, you didn't even know it was a hotel from the front.Would highly recommend and would stay again. ',GOOD,
'Great little hotel My husband and I stayed at the Sumner Hotel for two nights. Our trip to London was purely for some retail therapy and a trip to the theatre.We have travelled quite a bit around the world and have visited London on numerous occasions.This little, quaint, homely hotel was perfect for our visit this time.On first arrival, the outside of the townhouse is well kept and inviting. On entering the front door, it really felt as though we were trespassing into someones beautiful home, as there are no obvious signs of a reception desk (this we eventually found in the back room of the house). The d茅cor of the living room and entrance is beautiful. Our welcome was friendly and we were taken down to our room straight away. We were in room 100, which is in the basement of the townhouse 鈥?the path and narrow stair case to the room was slightly disappointing as the grandeur of the entire house did not extend to the basement.Room 100 was spacious 鈥?the d茅cor plainer than the rest of the house, but none the less it was clean and bright and we were pleased. However we were slightly disappointed with the size and d茅cor of the bathroom (it was tiny and definitely did not reflect the rest of the d茅cor of the house) 鈥?it was spotlessly clean.It is a 5/10 minute stroll from the Marble Arch tube station, and 15/20 minute stroll to James Street where you will find loads of restaurants. Location for us was perfect.The location is also very quiet 鈥?our room was at the front of the house and we did not hear anything from the street above. We were up early both mornings and if you are a light sleeper, the noise of staff walking above us on the wooden floor will awaken you from about 6am - this did not annoy us that much 鈥?although if you were trying to have a lie in, this may be quite annoying. The breakfast room is bright and modern. Yes, the breakfast does not have a huge selection (compared to a larger hotel) but the quality and standard is higher than the mass produced breakfasts sitting under warm lamps for hours. Overall, we were very pleased with our choice of hotel 鈥?especially as the cost was fantastic for London. ',GOOD,
'Will be back Went with my 22 year old son to Chelsea v Liverpool in the Champions League Semi last month. Have stayed in various hotels over the years and never found one that combined good price 拢94 bb, good location, good food and pleasent staff (even at 1 in the morning serving us a drink). We will definately be back here and i have recently recommended it to some friiends travelling to London soon. Keep it up guys.... ',GOOD,

'Lovely hotel in a nice neighbourhood Stayed here for one night in a massive basement room which was really quiet. Think it must have been a premier type room as it was lovely, well decorated and very very clean. Checked in early and left luggage when we returned room was ready. It is in a fab area only minutes away from the station. The staff are so helpful.What defo stay here again although when booked I was quoted 拢145 they never added tax onto it so it was approx 拢170 check this when booking but considering the location and the standard was hotel it was a great price ',GOOD,
'Fabulous We recently spent ten nights at the Sumner at Marble Arch. It was our first stay at the hotel and can report that it was as good as the reviews in Trip Advisor. Staff were all attentive, helpful and polite. Location is excellent being close to transport and sites. The area was also safe and quiet which is great for tired travellers.This is more like a home than a hotel with comfortable rooms, modern bathrooms, very clean, friendly staff, free internet and a comfortable loungeroom to relax in. The breakfast also was an excellent way to start the day and changed slightly each day for a bit of variety. The staff here also were very friendly and were keen to attend to our every need.Overall I have no hesitation in recommending the Sumner as a great place to stay. We can't wait to return! ',GOOD,

'wonderful hotel in a great area We have just stayed in The Sumner in London and found it a lovely, warm place to stay in a great area. It is very easy to get around London from this hotel. The breakfast was good food and plenty of it. The hotel did like it's heating but so did most of London - we prefer fresh air. The room was lovely and quite. A great stay. ',GOOD,
'Pretty good, would come back Stayed here in march. The hotel is perfectly located for shopping and not to far from Soho. It looks really nice and the rooms are very comfortable. Rooms size is reasonable for London.The first room we got was a large room on the first floor looking out over the street. Sound insulations wasn't very good good and the road a bit noisy so we changed rooms. We got a great room on the top (attic) floor. Very cosy and really quiet. Loved it.Very nice manager and a very nice girl at check in, but she seemed it bit distracted and not very professional. When I stood in front of here for the 4th time in less then an hour she kindly welcomed me to the hotel and asked if I wanted to check-in. Mind you, this is a very small hotel. Maybe I'm just very easy to forget.Breakfast was fine, but a bit early 08:00 tell 09:30 and somewhat cramped. ',GOOD,
'The Sumner never disappoints! I've just returned from my third stay (8 nights this time) at The Sumner in the past 13 months. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The location is very good: three blocks to Marble Arch tube station, yet in a quiet neighborhood. The rooms are very nicely decorated, and good sized (at least for London: one should never expect American-sized hotel rooms anywhere in Europe). Everything (the rooms, common areas, and breakfast room) was very clean and inviting. The beds deserve a special mention: I slept better than I've slept in months! The room rates are exceptional: I challege anyone to find a comparable hotel in London at anywhere near this price.Most importantly, however, the staff is wonderful. Everything went without a hitch, and they are friendly and helpful. Special kudos to the women who serve breakfast: always cheerful and on the ball.I love The Sumner, and I'll defintely be back as soon as possible! ',GOOD,
'Pleasant central London hotel We enjoyed a one night stay at this hotel. Our room was large and well furnished and the shower with a rainwater head was enormous.Despite being on the ground floor at the front of the hotel, the room was quiet and we slept well in a very confortable bed. The breakfast room was bright and cheery and the continental breakfast was fine - but woiuld prefer real suasages to frankfurters! The hotel is very conveniently placed for shopping. The reception was courteous and efficient. ',GOOD,
'Home away from Home Our first trip to London, we stayed the first week of March. Could not have picked a better spot. We arrived from Heathrow, took the express train to Paddington and cab to the Sumner. Fast. This hotel is quiet (we were on the back), spotlessly clean, and convenient to Marble Arch Tube. We felt safe at all times (my wife and I are in our early 50's). One evening we were running late to a show. In 15 minutes we went from our room to the tube and then to Waterloo station with time to spare. Unbelievable. Service was impeccable and came with a wonderful breakfast to start our day (loved the poached eggs and they have very good tea). WIFI worked without a hitch. This hotel delivers what it promises and our expectations were exceeded at a price we felt was fair.We will be back next year. ',GOOD,
'Sooo quiet! Picked this after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. It was a good choice...5 mins from tube station. Whole hotel was very clean and well decorated. Staff very friendly and helpful....our shower sprang a leak and they were very quick to get it sorted. Beds were really comfortable and it must have been the quietest London hotel I've ever stayed in...slept very well! Only criticism was that breakfast was not very varied.....after 3 days it was getting a little repetitive. Oh......and tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been a nice touch. But we would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Marble Arch Secret! We stayed at the Great Sumner from April 5-9,room 101.This was a Deluxe room and was very big in comparison to other European Hotels that we have stayed in.Breakfast was good, free internet,very close to the tube and the Hop On Bus Tour.I recommend the bus tour for all first timers. (As were we)It's not cheap, but what is in London.The hotel is close to 2 local pubs, convenience store,great chicken swarma sp? takeout,Pret with great salads and sandwiches and others too numerous to mention. Please trust me, this is a Great location.. We walked down Oxford St to Chinatown, Trafalgar square. We walked to Harrods and Big Ben.Back to the hotel, the staff were great. Whatever, we wanted they got for us.When we go back to London, this is where we are staying.... ',GOOD,
'40TH Experience What a fantastic stay. We have just returned after spending five nights at The Sumner to celebrate our 40th. anniversary. It was indeed a memorable stay.We cannot rate the hotel and its wonderful staff enough. Everything was first class, from our extremely spotlessly clean and comfortable king room on the second floor to the most friendly and welcoming staff in reception and in the breakfast room. The buffet breakfast was more than acceptable,with cereals, cold meats and a hot buffet, tea, coffee and toast. More than enough to set anyone up for the day.The location could not be more ideal, only a short walk to Marble Arch with all transport links to anywhere in London.Shopping and restaurants right on the doorstep.We will have no hesitation in recommending The Sumner to all our family and friends. We most definatley will return. Thank you all at The Sumner for the very fond memories of our Ruby Wedding anniversary. ',GOOD,
'great hotel The Sumner Hotel was fantastic. The rooms were clean and lovely, the staff was friendly, the breakfast was great and the price was perfect.We took our three children, and truly felt at home. I had requested connecting rooms but was told no rooms connected directly. I was a bit concerned before we left that our kids would be too far away from us. In the end it was a perfect set-up.Each floor of the Sumner has two rooms that can be closed off from the hallway..so it was like a huge suite. The hotel lobby feels like a comfortable living room, with great books on London, games for the kids and internet access. ',GOOD,
'lovely hotel, great location Myself and hubby were in London visiting family, so decided to have belated valentines break by having a night away from the kids and going to the Comedy Store. I looked for hotel using Trip Advisor and found this little gem, it was no 8 out of all the hotels listed for London, so figured it must be ok.We were delighted with the location, the price, the room, the breakfast and the staff. Just off Marble Arch, it took us about 30 mins to stroll up to Leicester Square, via Regent St. We both love walking around central London so really enjoyed this. The room was gorgeous. We booked a deluxe double and it was really spacious with a massive bed, fully stocked and not overly expensive mini-bar and a fabulous shower.Breakfast was included in the price which is not common in London hotels so a real bonus and it was great. We could only stay for one night, but would love to have been there for a few days, if only for the great shopping to be had on Oxford Street. Having 3 kids under 5, the chance to lie in bed, drinking wine and watching Deal or No Deal on a weds afternoon is pure luxury and this hotel was great. Will be back. ',GOOD,
'The Sumner was great - would stay there again! My wife, 9-year old son and myself just returned from a week in London. We booked, a king double with a roll-away bed and were very pleased. The hotel is small, but that added to the experience as it has the appeal of a home. And might I add, an extremely clean home. The room was large enough for us; in fact maybe a little larger than we had expected. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant and the central location gave us easy access to transportation and all the things we wanted to do. Much has been said about the breakfast. We thought that it was a nice way to start the day and was in the tradition of an English breakfast. If folks were expecting a full American breakfast, it's not that easy to find anywhere in London. Sometimes, the difference in a stay can be measured in the little things. In the case of The Sumner, the staff, the hotel's cleanliness and even the Easter treat left in our room on Easter Sunday all added up to make this a place we'll certainly visit again and again. ',GOOD,
'A nice small hotel near Marble Arch I will begin by saying that March, and particularly this cold one, is not the ideal time to be in London, particularly at a hotel where being close to Hyde Park is one of the perks. This is a small boutique townhouse hotel, close enough to Marble Arch tube and bus stops, but in a quiet mostly residential neighborhood. Plenty of restaurants, and close to Oxford Street shopping. London is so easy to get around anyway.Traveling with our teenage daughters, we took two rooms. It seems as though there are basically two rooms per floor in each of two adjoining buildings, so our two rooms actually functioned like a family suite with a door that could be closed to the stairwell and elevator.Our superior double was quite spacious, but our daughters' standard double was small and a little dark, facing the back with only one window. Bathrooms were small, with a pre-fab shower that felt cramped even to me, and I am a small woman. My husband was actually claustrophobic. Everything was spotlessly clean however, and decor was pleasing in a contemporary, boutique hotel-like fashion. Flat screen TV, free wireless internet, adapter built in to the desk outlet - all nice touches. Beds and sheets very comfortable.Breakfast was, in my opinion, unappealing and subpar. Orange juice out of a can.We picked up breakfast from local patisserie after the first morning. Although the street is quiet to begin with, and there are literally two sets of window panes for each window, we had problems with noise - footsteps and voices - from the room above. Front desk staff were sometimes literally not there when we were looking for them, but once they showed up, were quite pleasant and helpful.Overall, decent value, some very nice features. Would probably try to score something a little better next time. ',GOOD,
'Adored the Sumner My husband and I stayed at the Sumner at the end of February 2008. I can not say enough about how thoughtful and accommodating the staff was. The room was spacious and even had US plug ins. The neighborhood is excellent for strolling and very close to the beautiful Hyde Park. The price for the location would be hard to beat. ',GOOD,

'loved it! My mother and I stayed here for a long weekend and we both loved the hotel. The location is very central, close to oxford street and mable arch - still, our room was soo quiet! Stayed in a standard room - a little small as we imagined - but very clean and stylish. The staff is very nice, polite and helpfull, made our experience even greater. Overall - loved it! ',GOOD,
'LOVED LOVED LOVED the Sumner! I just got back from my trip to London with my parents and my sister, and we had a fabulous stay at the Sumner. I stayed in room 104 and although it was on the smaller side (I shared the room with my sister), it was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean and the shower had great water pressure and I always had hot water. The hairdryer provided in the room worked great too, which usually doesn't happen with hotel hairdryers! The staff were always friendly and very helpful. There is a computer with internet on the main floor that was great, and a little main floor lobby area with couches stocked with magazines. There is also a lift/elevator which was a godsend for how heavy my luggage was! The location near the Marble Arch tube stop was super helpful, as it's only two blocks away so you could get anywhere super fast. Really, my only complaint was that the pillows were very thin, as I like to have a little fluffier of a pillow when I sleep. It was the perfect place for my family, and I would really recommend it to anyone. ',GOOD,
'Sumner hotel booked a king size room for 3 nights and got a good sized room with very large bed. Shower room on the small side but acceptable. Tthe main disappointment was the breakfast which had little choice. Only two cereals and poached eggs like bullets! Bacon appeared on one day. ',GOOD,
'Restful comfort The Sumner Hotel was a restful comfortable place to stay. It was so close to Marble Arch yet once we had closed the door, it offered us a tranquil, serene retreat. The staff were helpful and professional, the room was very clean and beautifully decorated with a king size bed. We were particularly thrilled that the room was spacious as we were at the end of our holiday and could rationalise our packing easily. The shower was of antipodean quality - powerful and luxurious. We were thrilled by the free internet, the graceful sitting room where we met up with London based friends and the substantial, diverse breakfast offered as part of the package. We will definitely stay at The Sumner Hotel again and have already recommended it to friends. ',GOOD,
'great hotel Just come back having stayed there for the last three nights.Great location although not obvious where it is so remember the number in the street. Rooms very clean, excellent shower,good minibar.TV fine and beds comfortable. Breakfast good. Nice sitting room with good choice of London guides. Free internet access there as well. Prices reasonable for central London.Would certainly recommend it and would go back. ',GOOD,
'Perfect! I stayed at the Sumner Hotel with my parents, sister and husband. Everything about it was wonderful. The rooms were clean, beautiful, and had comfortable beds. There was free internet access. The staff was PHENOMENALLY helpful. My sister and parents lost their bags on the way to London. The staff helped us to find everything they needed. They even tracked the lost baggage hourly online! They let us use their umbrellas on the way to the store to get new ones. They even held our bags for us while we were in Paris so our cousin in London could bring them to us on the train. The breakfasts in the morning were wonderful. There was an assortment of fruits, yogurts, breads and really great tea. I think it was the best hotel experience I have ever had. ',GOOD,
'Very pleasant and spacious rooms, a lovely stay!       bed ',GOOD,
'Distinctly average Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor and seen the Sumner ranked as 6 out of over 1000 hotels in London, I was expecting an enjoyable and impressive experience. Unfortunately, the Sumner hotel is distinctely average. Nothing stood out from this experience.I booked a Queen double. The room turned out to be reasonably small and was not actually a double, but two twin beds attached together. The bathroom was perhaps the most disappointing aspect: very small with a tiny shower. In addition the air conditioning was not working properly and cannot be used to heat the room, only cool the room.My other area of disappointment was breakfast. Not only were they unable to offer room service breakfast (an essential part of a romantic theatre weekend away), but the breakfast room was cramped and hot food selection limited to sausages, eggs and beans. Where was the bacon, hash browns and black pudding? No english breakfast on a Sunday morning is complete without these. The only above average thing about the whole hotel was the extremely tasty sausages.Overall, a disappointing distinctly average experience. ',POOR,
'Fantastic Find I spent a lot of time researching for the right place, and it was time well spent. After an initial mix up with the booking (apparently Late Rooms had double booked the room), the rest of the stay was perfect. They checked us in 3 hours early and our room was of an excellent size (not just for London, but for any location). Although we didn't have a bath, the shower was great and bathroom modern and stylish. Bath robes were provided and the decor in the whole hotel was calming and pleasingly traditional yet modern. Staff were very friendly and personal. I can't stand the big chain hotels for the impersonal service you get, and The Sumner was a fantastic anitdote. My only very minor complaint was that the Georgian windows in the sitting room (with free internet access) were crying out for a Christmas tree, and there were no decorations at all. Amazing location about 5 mins walk from Marble Arch but in a very quiet little street. Breakfast wasn't amazing, but perfectly adequate. ',GOOD,
'Stylish, quiet and very clean My wife and I stayed for 5 nights in December 2007 for a mixture of business and leaisure. Being just a couple of blocks from Marble Arch it is very convenient for Oxford Street but also very near Hyde Park. The staff were delightful - very welcoming and professional. Although occupying a traditional terrace house the whole hotel has new modern decor to a very high standard. There is free wireless internet access throughout and a PC in the lounge for guests. There is a lift but some rooms still require you to negotiate about 10 stairs. We had a second floor double room overlooking the rear and it was amazingly quiet for central London. Even a front room should be quite quiet as the traffic is very light in that street. The bed was huge and very comfortable with a duvet. The bathroom with shower was very good with clean fresh towels. Breakfast was 8.00 - 9.30 in a beautiful basement room - the usual buffet of cereals, fruit juice, yoghurt, toast, fresh bread plus hot bacon or sausage, scrambled egg (a bit tired looking), tomatoes etc. I would recommend it highly. ',GOOD,

'Highly Reccomend the Sumner I spent the Thanksgiving weekend at the Sumner and it was all that the reviews stated. Our room was clean and quiet, and the beds were super comfy!! The staff was helpful, friendly and greated us every time we returned. The internet access in the lobby was great for looking up the things we planned to do each day. I thought that the breakfast was FABULOUS, hot with lots of choices, which is phenomenal that it is included in the price of the room. I was pleasantly surprised that the menu items even changed somewhat from day to day.The hotel had a great list of recommended restaurants, one of which was so memorable that shoudl I return it will be on the top of my list. Make sure to try Le Relais de Venise - the steak was to die for!!! I can't wait to return to The Sumner!! ',GOOD,
'A big let down The Sumner is the sister Hotel of the award-winning 5 Sumner Place, and claims to have adopted many of its attributes and practises. We only stayed one night, but were disappointed that it didnt live up to expectations. The room was small, had no drawer space and the designer decorations weren't much in evidence, unless you counted a painted old wardrobe. The flat-screen TV was, strangely, positioned on the wall to the side of the bed, which meant the best view was to be had by sitting on the end of the bed, rather than in it. The buffet breakfast was a big disappointment. OK, this is only a small hotel but the choice was very limited. A choice of 2 cereals, 2 juices (one orange, the other??). A small array of meats and cheese and a hot selection consisting of poached eggs, beans and...... frankfurters. These were awful, and lingered far longer than the rest of a poor breakfast. We asked for toast (no toaster available to do your own) and got one slice of white and one of brown. I'm sure we could have had more, but we couldn't be bothered. Considering what we paid, our worst choice yet in London ',POOR,

'Good value, good location for London Booked after seeing good reviews on Tripadvisor. London is now mega expensive, so it's good to see a good value hotel like this doing well. It's like an upmarket BB - clean, bright, nice staff. The room we had was small (they do have bigger rooms though), but perfectly OK, after all you're not in the room much. We've stayed in a few London hotels and this is one of the more intimate, in contrast to the nearby Thistle Marble Arch, say. Depends what you're after. The only complaint is that the towels were too new- so a bit sqeaky! Still, better than the threadbare efforts you get in a lot of London hotels.Highly recommended for base to see theatre shows and shops - but don't go and see the Seagull! at the New London, maybe we're thick but Russian symbolism lost us; we did go to see Les Miserables , took us 20 years to get around to it, but well worth it. ',GOOD,
'Great small hotel My two teenaged children and I stayed for 3 nights at the Sumner from 24-27 November 2007. I have been to London before and had stayed in hotels along Oxford Street and at apartments in Mayfair. I found this hotel from the internet and having read the good reviews, booked a triple room directly with them online. I must say that I made the correct decision. This hotel is small but I liked the ambience. The room was not big but spacious enough for us. It was clean and comfortable. This is important for me. The availability of free internet access and elevator was a bonus. I avoid hotels without elevators due to luggage concerns. The shower facilities were good and toiletries supplied nice. We liked the availability of ironing facilities and hair dryer in our room. The reception staff was friendly and helpful, which we appreciate. It is so close to the Marble Arch underground station and we had no problems visiting sights in London. Being Muslims, food is a concern. But Edgeware Road has plenty of small Middle Eastern restaurants and is only a short walking distance away so food was no problem. We felt safe walking the streets around this hotel, and having Starbucks and Sainsbury's around the corner is also great. My children had no complaints while we were there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to visitors to London. I certainly will stay in this hotel again. Getting a London Black Cab was easy. So transport to the airport was no problem. Notwithstanding the above, I would have appreciated some assistance with our luggage on check-out. Since there were three of us, I didn't ask for assitance but an offer to help carry the luggage would have been nice and appreciated. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful stay in a great neighborhood November 30, 2007 We've just returned from a six day stay in London. The Sumner Hotel was just lovely. It was in an excellent location, close to the Marble Arch Tube, a selection of restaurants and shops, and nice walking tours. The room was very warm and inviting, and staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with directions and maps. We would no doubt stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Great Find in London... Wow, it's not too often that you come across a great hotel, in a good location at a reasonable price (well reasonable for London anyway).Situated on a side street about halfway down the Edgware Road it's about a 10 minute stroll to Marble Arch / Oxford St and 15-20 minutes to Paddington station. There are a few NCP car parks nearby including Portman Square which is at the end of the road the hotel is on (5 mins walk) although NCP car parks aren't cheap so if you're staying longer than 24 hours it's probably not a good idea to drive into and park in London.The hotel has been very recently refurbished - the reception and lounge have wooden/laminate floors, subtle lighting and comfortable furniture. The reception staff, like many London hotels, seem to be eastern european and are very helpful. I didn't need to test their local knowledge but I'm sure they could direct you to a local attraction if you asked.The bedrooms are very well decorated, large comfortable bed, desk and a wardrobe. The room I stayed in wasn't exactly huge but there was enough room for two people although I probably wouldn't want to spend an enormous amount of time couped up in it. The bathroom was only a shower cubicle but it was roomy enough and modern fittings throughout with plenty of hot water.All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel if you're visiting London - you can stay at the nearby Marriot for twice the price but you'd be missing out on a gem! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful My husband and I had been researching London hotels for days and luckily stumbled across the Sumner. It was a great find. Our cabbie had a bit of trouble finding it and if you're taking the tube, be informed that the addresses on this street are very odd...they go up one side and down the other. I highly recommend the Sumner. The room was immaculately clean, spacious, beautifully appointed and quiet. The staff was very helpful in general and specifically in recommending transportation options...bus vs. tube, etc... Breakfast was great with many options. I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Sumner. Also, it's a great value in a very expensive city. ',GOOD,
'Not that impressed We were not impressed with this hotel. After having read the fantastic reviews maybe we were expecting abit more. We were 3 adults and when I booked thay assured me that 3 adults could easily stay in 1 room. Upon arrival, there were 2 single beds and at the foot of them a third bed had been placed. We tried moving the bed a bit further away from the other beds but had no space in the room like that. During the night I usually got the others duvets thrown on to me, etc. It was clean and newly refurbished and the majority of the staff were friendly. One complaint is that on the 2 days out of the 3 the cleaner only placed 1 set of clean towels for us and no extra toilet paper. I can accept that mistakes can happen, i called reception and they immediately sent up 2 more sets of clean towels as well as an extra roll of toilet paper. However, when the same situation occured again on the 2nd morning we were a bit diassapointed. Breakfast was offered in our rate, it was ok but not a great choice and there was only 1 girl there on duty so it took quite a long time for tables to be re-set and for the juice, coffee and food to be refilled when they had finished. The breakfast room was a bit of a dissapointment, it was in the basement and small and had no windows. The location was great however, and it was clean but after having read so many wonderful reviews I think we were expecting a bit more. Maybe we would, maybe we wouldnt return, we have not yet decided on that one. A piece of advice however, the rooms shouldnt be offered as triple rooms, they are not very spacious to begin with so a third bed makes them extra tight. ',POOR,
'Relaxing stay We have just spent the weekend in the Sumner. I had high expectations as the reviews were very good and I wasn't disappointed. Our flight was delayed and we were late for a lunch reservation so I couldn't check in, I simply left the bags with the front desk and they left my bags to the room. Breakfast was simple but sufficent, enough to kep you going until lunch time. The room itself was large with plenty of space and quiet even though it was at the front of the building. Location wise is was also very good, close to Oxford street and Regent Street. Staff were plesent and very helpful. ',GOOD,
'Sumner Hotel a Perfect Choice The Sumner was the perfect choice for first trip to London. Great location just north of Hyde Park, very helpful staff. Nice updated property, clean and quiet, and in great London neighborhood. Easy access to underground and train stations, but also situated for walking to major sites and for shopping. Easy walk to good restaurants and pubs ...recommended by staff. Staying in a neighborhood allows for a real feel of London, and this one was very good. Staff was very responsive before and during the stay, and we would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'New York Style Boutique Hotel We stayed at The Sumner Hotel from Sunday to Wednesday(September 30 to October 3). We booked the largest room and stayed on the main floor. The pictures shown on their website are accurate and the place is newly renovated. There is always an individual at reception and they are a pleasure to deal with. If you have any questions, they are always available to answer them. The owner also takes pride in the Hotel and we met him personally during our stay. We would recommend this place and thank both the owner and the employees for an enjoyable stay. ',GOOD,
'The Sumner Hotel--A delightful choice in London! My sister and I just returned from our first trip to London. (We selected the Sumner Hotel based upon Trip Advisor research and positive comments found online.)We loved everything about this little hotel! The location was ideal for us. The Sumner is very near the Marble Arch tube station and within a short walking distance of several bus stops. While the hotel sits on a quiet residential street, there are many places to dine, drink, and shop in a two or three block area. The ever-popular Oxford Street shopping area and the Marks  Spencer store are only a short walk away. We felt quite comfortable while out in the neighborhood. One evening, we returned very late from the theater and walked back to the Sumner from the tube station with absolutely no worries about safety or security.We stayed in two different rooms at the Sumner...both were delightful. Each room had a towel warmer in the bathroom and a hair dryer. (One of our rooms even had a pants press and ironing board!) Big, fluffy duvet covers and quality linens adorned each comfortable bed. The bathrooms were positively spotless! A buffet breakfast was served downstairs until 10:00 am. Fresh coffee and juice were available each morning. Several food choices were also offered including: eggs, meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, cereal, jams, and breads. Eating at the buffet was a great way to start a busy day of sightseeing.The Sumner Hotel staff was SO helpful. Beata knows the London area very well and helped us plan routes to major London attractions. We were especially grateful that the desk personnel were able to arrange efficient transportation for us to the airport and train station.All of these ammenities came at what we thought was a very reasonable price. We would highly recommend The Sumner Hotel and will definitely return to stay here again on our next visit to London. ',GOOD,
'Great Quality Hotel in a Super Location We stayed here for one night and had a great stay. The best bits are the cleanliness of the place and its central location and its close proximity to Marble Arch tube station. Breakfast was disappointing - items having run out and not quickly replenished and only a very small choice of cereals (2). Breakfast adequate but have had better in other top cities in this price range.Please be very aware of the extremely slippery front entrance/exit when wet. Today it was wet after a shower when we left and my husband slipped twice. He only saved himself by grabbing the rails on the left - a nasty accident waiting to happen. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Week! We (my spouse and I) just completed a wonderful week visiting London and staying at the Sumner Hotel. We chose this small hotel based on Tripadvisor ratings and were not disappointed. We stayed in the deluxe king suite on the first floor. Great location, very convenient, perhaps a little noisy being right on the street but it's a busy city and this street is actually off the main roads. Hotel location is within easy walking distance to stores on Oxford Street, many pubs, train stations, tubes and bus stops.The room was clean and comfortable with a WONDERFUL large shower. The staff at the reception desk , especially Beata and Pietre, could not have done more! Friendly, helpful, always anxious to be of service. The only drawback was lack of drawer space in the room which for a 7 night stay was a little inconvenient. However, overall, this hotel was a great choice and we will not hesitate to return and to recommend it to our friends. ',GOOD,
'A chic hotel A Jewel of a hotel, very chic, beautifully decorated and in a great location, a five minute walk from Oxford Street and nearest Tube. The staff were very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Loved the Roses chocolates dotted about in the hotel. You cant just wander in off the street, the outside door can only be opened by your room keycard or Reception, which is great for security. I felt safe walking around outside the hotel, there was a handy local pub a couple of doors away which we visited after the theatre, again felt very welcome. We had a triple room, ideal for friends, although a bit tight if you were staying there for more than a weekend. Breakfast buffet (hot) was very nice and something for everyone. Would deifintely stay again. ',GOOD,
'A Wonderful Place! Wow....my friend and I had a wonderful time in the early part of September and The Sumner helped our vacation be a tremendous memory. The hotel provided us with good food, nice surroundings, clean environment, and great conversations. The staff was very helpful and fun. If and when I come back to London, I do and want to stay at The Sumner. Great location, close to transportation (Tube and bus), restaurants galore, shops...just about anything you wish for. I had a fantastic time in London, and The Sumner was a good small part of it. Thank you and I bow to you. Keep up the good work!! ',GOOD,
'Great experience My fiance and I stayed at the Sumner for 2 nights mainly based upon the reviews on Tripadvisor. Rates were very reasonable (for London standards) at 135 GBP per night (plus VAT tax). We arrived about 6am (friday) the day of check in, but luckily our room was ready!It may be hard to tell from the pictures on Tripadvisor but the hotel is really nice and very well done. The hotel is clean, extremely quiet and the rooms spacious. The beds are are actually two beds that are conjoined, however it's basically like one king bed. Beds were really comfortable and I slept great. The location was perfect for us. It's right next to Hyde Park, Oxford Street, Marble Arch tube stop. It's a bit of walk to attractions like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, etc but I thought this area was a better place to stay. More restuarants, shoppping and pubs. I would definitely recommend the Sumner. Great boutique hotel. ',GOOD,
'Best London Location This is a lovely hotel in one of the best locations, especially for shopping. Our room was on the 4th floor, reached by a lift and overlooking the street. Very clean, comfortable, spacious, it had complimentary toiletries by Soames  Gilchrist in the bathroom. and a mini bar that was stuffed full of everything, from wine to chocolate bars, no bottle opener, but we had 2 glasses in the room. There are local grocery shops very close by so you have a choice whether to use it or not. The staff are very nice and helpful and the downstairs sitting room has a computer with internet access for everyone to use, at no extra charge. There are also daily newspapers and lots of magazines and books to read. The breakfasts had a good choice, cheese, fruit, sausage/eggs/bacon. The area seemed quite safe, even after dark there were lots of people about. We will definitely stay here on our next visit to London. ',GOOD,
'Thanks for the recommendation We were in London last week (mid-week) for an overnight stay. I went on sites like hotels.com to find a room and came across the Sumner. Never heard of it before, so I searched on TripAdvisor and you all said it was fab, so we booked it direct. I have stayed at the Cumberland and the Montcalm before and the Sumner is just around the corner and worth trying to get into - it's only small, so might have to be lucky. Beautifully renovated hotel, really well done. Small gripes: room should have been ready for 1pm, but wasn't. So we went to lunch and had the best fish platter in years in England at a seafood restuarant around the corner. We had one of the rooms featured in their photos - really nice, but lacking pen and paper to jot down notes on the phone to a friend and lacking a bottle opener and glasses to make proper use of the mini-bar. Not the end of the world, but things you'd expect for a 4-star. Room was noisier than I expected from the reviews, but I guess I'm not used to London where traffic never stops and road sweepers/recyclers start early!Breakfast was very nice - very continental and included in the price - a bonus in London. A very nice, friendly and chic hotel. Give it a try. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Sumner In my opinion the Sumner Hotel and all of the staff are quite simply outstanding!! The public spaces are warm and inviting and the staff could not have been more gracious.My only concern is if one has mobility issues they only have a few rooms that dont involve some steps. We were in room 208 and the lift took us up to the 4th floor. We then climbed 5 steps. However, I was assured that when booking that the rooms in the lower level and on the ground level do not require steps. In any event help was offered if needed. With the sky high prices in London this hotel offers real value and the breakfast buffet was nicely presented. This will be my hotel of choice in London as long as the current management and staff are in place. Also the room was very quiet and everything was very clean throughout the property.Rick C,Washington Indiana ',GOOD,
'Perfect short stay This hotel is perfect for a short stay in London for business or pleasure. It is spotlessly clean, the rooms are more than adequate and well above average for central London. The location is good. Very close to Marble Arch underground and with ample restaurants in the vicinity. There is a decent choice at breakfast and the staff are very pleasant and helpful. There is good wireless internet access for free - make sure you ask for the code when you check in. Good value, clean and comfortable, a rarity in London. ',GOOD,
'Excellent standard, location and staff We booked two queen size rooms for 1 night (18th Oct).On arriving at the hotel we were pleased to find a very smart and well presented reception area. Although we arrived at midday both rooms had been made ready for our arrival. The bedrooms are finished to a high standard and very clean. After tea and biscuits in the lounge we spoke to Beata on reception into the possibilty of theatre tickets. Within minutes we had 4 front row circle tickets, right in the centre for The sound of music!!!!Wow, what a show.The following morning we had breakfast which was excellent and served in a lovely bright room.All in all this is one of the best hotels that I have stayed in in London including some 5* hotels.If you want a well located, well presented, efficient hotel then the Sumner should be on your list.Finally, to Beata, you are a star! Thanks for making our short stay in London so enjoyable. ',GOOD,
'A Wonderful Stay in London We loved this hotel! It was in a great location--just a short walk to the Marble Arch tube station. It seemed to be a relatively quiet street, although our room was on the inner courtyard, which made for much peace and quiet. They provided free internet access in a large library area downstairs. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms big enough by London standards. The staff was very helpful. Great breakfast. Great Italian restaurant close by. I would love to stay here each time I visit London. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Stay at the Sumner!! My husband and I stayed at the Sumner for 4 nights in early September as part of our honeymoon. We loved the location as it was a short walk to the Marble Arch Tube (5 mins.) as well as close to the bus stop(s) so we could get anywhere we needed to go very easily. Also, the neighborhood is very quiet, which was nice.The room was very clean, the staff was extremely helpful whenever we asked them for anything and the breakfast was certainly quite adequate to get the day going (eggs, beans, fruit, cheeses, coffee, juice, croissants, ham or bacon).When we arrived for check-in, our room was not quite ready so the receptionist on duty provided coffee and tea and cookies for us to eat in the downstairs living room. Also, for our last night at the Sumner, they provided a small bottle of wine for us to share with a congratulations note to us since we are newlyweds. It was a nice touch.The price was very good for London in my opinion, and I would love to stay here again! ',GOOD,
'great value, good location Just read reviews from others, I would like to add that the triple room is huge, stuff members are very helpful. We got to the hotel before 9:00 am and was able to check in right way! ',GOOD,
'Excellent value in central London The hotel, an elegant converted townhouse, is in a quiet, very central location near Marble Arch tube station. Our room cost just under 拢150.00. It was small but comfortable and well equipped. The shower room was also small but it was bright and modern. The public rooms are stylish - the whole hotel has been recently refurbished. The staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. A varied breakfast is included in the price - this was quite good though not outstanding. Still, overall this hotel offers excellent value for money and thoroughly deserves its high tripadvisor ratings. ',GOOD,
'Perfect Location! Great Hotel! I write this review of our stay at the Sumner nearly three months after we returned home to the U.S., yet the memory of our wonderful stay at the hotel remains as strong as the day we departed London.There really isn't much we can add to other stellar reviews other than to say that one runs out of superlatives when recounting our stay at the Sumner.The staff was fantastic -- booked all of our dinner reservations as requested prior to our arrival, our room was excellent and the location was ideal.We have found a home in London and will stay there any other time we decide to return. ',GOOD,
'great stay at the Sumner + good location to all the main sights, newly renovated, clean/comfortable/efficient, great wireless internet, breakfast was ok, staff was very good/friendly/helpful, overall excellent value for the money in London = we chose the Sumner mostly based on Tripadvisor feedback ...the feedback was bang-on! We had a really good experience at the Sumner and will definitely return, I may even consider staying here on business for my next trip to London ',GOOD,
'Excellent Home Base in London This is a great place to be when in London. If you just want to do your own thing and not have to deal with crowded lobbies, elevators, and want a solid, no-nonsense place to be in London then this is where you want to be. It's very low-key. When I was walking to the Marble Arch tube I would pass the big and modern Cumberland hotel and was just so happy I wasn't staying there with all the crowds and doormen. The Sumner is perfect for independent travelers who want safety, quality, service, and to be away from the crowds and other people. The breakfast was very good. One example of service: I accidentally put the do not disturb sign out instead of the clean room sign. we came back from a day of siteseeing and the room wasn't cleaned. I called down to the front desk and the room was cleaned immediately. that wouldnt happen at a large hotel. also, the free internet in lobby was perfect. ',GOOD,
'The Sumner is Awesome My husband, daughter and myself stayed at the Sumner from August 20th through the 26th. We were very happy with our choice. The people at the front desk were very helpful. Several mornings we had early tours and it was no problem getting breakfast a bit early. (cereal, milk, fruit, bread) The hotel is designed to give maximum privacy- as we got off the hotel on the second floor we had to walk up a short flight of steps into an alcove and there were only two rooms in this area. We had a room with a king and a cot for my daughter. The cot was very comfortable (we were a little concerned about that). For a London hotel room the size was pretty good. The location was great. We were right around the corner from Starbucks (which doesn't open till 7:00 for those of you used to a cup of coffee really early) and within walking distance of many really good restaurants. We ate at the Bombay Spice twice- absolutely delicious. We were also a 5 minute walk to the Marble Arch Tube station as well as stores to buy water and snacks. The room was clean and well kept. The bathroom is not huge but quite functional. Storage for clothes was not tremendous but we had enough space for three people's clothes for a week. The hotel has a lovely sitting area downstairs with a computer available for use. There is also free wireless access. Overall, we were very pleased with the Sumner and would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel Tripadvisor reviews steered us here and we were very pleased with this property. Great location for anything you want to do. Hotel was very clean, staff was great, and breakfast was very good. Rooms and beds were fine-everything is quite new. We would definitely go back. ',GOOD,
'Absolutely Fabulous!!!! Booked this hotel after reading the reviews, I was taking my mother to London for the weekend to shop and take in show and sightsee, so needed to be central.Found the Sumner no problem off the tube station from Marble Arch, short walk away from Oxford street.First impressions were amazing, the hotel is beautiful and immaculate, we arrived at 10am and weren't due to check in till 12, receptionist took our bags to look after until we returned later in the day.When we returned later at about 4pm we were shown to our rooms and our bags had already been taken down for us. The room was the basement room 200 opposite the breakfast room and accessible by the lift. It was wonderful and not at all like I expected. air conditioning and immaculately clean and bathroom nice size with tub and powerful shower and the usual complimentary shampoos etc. Also nice fluffy white towels.The exterior door is closed and accessible by your room key card which is good being in heart of London.Next morning the breakfast served was wonderful and all you can eat and lots of selection which set us up for the day sightseeing, we checked out early and again left our bags for safekeeping rather than trail them with us around london, we returned at 5.30 and collected our bags.Overall our stay was fantastic and the staff very freindly and helpful and always willing to help and give a smie.I would definately return to this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel The Sumner is a terrific, quaint, elegant little hotel just off Oxford Street. We were immediately impressed by the ambiance of the place. Very quiet and mellow, very modern. The front desk was exceptionally helpful, the room was clean, the beds comfortable, the traditional English breakfast was also good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. We had an online rate of 100 pounds. Great Deal! ',GOOD,
'Great Stay at the Sumner Staff was super friendly and super helpful. Breakfast was good, and a good deal to be included in the price of our stay. The Hotel lobby, dining room, and our room were immaculate. Beds were comfortable. The room was a good size for London standards and noise was not a problem. Oh yeah, free hi-speed internet and bottled water was a plus.The neighborhood was quiet and about 5 min walk to the underground at Marble Arch. Very convenient location. One item to note, the streets between the underground and the hotel were dimly lit at night. Not really a problem, but may make some uncomfortable. However, we always felt safe walking through the area night.Overall, I felt we paid a bit more than we wanted to to stay here, but we did not regret it at all because we had a very comfortable stay. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Our family of four stayed three nights at this lovely hotel. It is very clean and well-maintained. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were a good size. Air conditioning in room was working properly as was the lift.The breakfast is very good. Not excessive, but certainly enough variety for our 10 year old and 17 year old.The hotel is about three blocks from the Marble Arch tube station.I have no hesitation endorsing this hotel to families or singles. In fact, I will probably be staying there again as a single in the near future. ',GOOD,
'10 Perfect Days and Nights... After much internet research and searching...my 14 year old daughter and I settled on The Sumner Hotel, in the Marble Arch neighborhood of London. The website and all communications with the hotel front desk pointed to a beautifully appointed room, quiet and convenient neighborhood, delightful staff and wonderful breakfast...we were never disappointed. We can't wait to go back!We stayed for 10 nights this June and would most definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a beautiful, small hotel at a reasonable price. Not only was the tube station around the block, but we had our choice of excellent neighborhood restaurants, a multi screen movie theatre, and a short walk to Shakespeare and the Open Air Theatre in Regents Park where we saw the most beautiful rose garden and had a delicious before show dinner, Madame Tussauds was also near by, as well as Speaker's Corner and Hyde Park.Go and enjoy!

'Wonderful Small Hotel A gem of a hotel in London. Affordable (by London standards), accessible, sophisticated decor, 24 hour service, US plugs in the room (major asset), spacious by London standards, intimate, tolerant of children, great breakfast. ',GOOD,
'Great Boutique Hotel We stayed at the Sumner Aug 13 - 18, 2007. The hotel was very modern with excellent facilities (i.e. plasma tv, AC, Internet Access) and great service from staff. Hotel was very conveniently located (five minutes) to Marble Arch, Subway and fantastic shopping of Oxford Street.Strongly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a modern, friendly, conveniently located hotel at a reasonable cost. ',GOOD,
'Good Location Nice boutique hotel well situated just off Oxford Street. and near Marble Arch so Hyde Park is close, if you need some fresh air.We had a superior room that was very clean and really could not be faulted. Breakfast was OK by UK standardsThe hotel overall was exactly what we were looking for - well situated, comfortable, clean and modern. We would stay there again as by London standards it was good value. ',GOOD,
'Boutique Boutique We stayed here for three nights in July in the more modern style room. Overall we were very pleased with the choice as it gives you what you expect of a boutique hotel - limited number of rooms, a more private personalized feel, and in this case spacious rooms (by London standards) and a great location being a two minute walk from Marble Arch tube station and the start of Oxford Street.I was a bit worried at first that my room was on the ground floor and hence with the road outside but it was actually ok in terms of noise. The bathroom was also a plus with a very spacious shower.This hotel was value for money (again by London standards!) because at 150 pounds per night you would not be able to find much else in the same area at the larger chain hotels and they almost always will have a smaller room. The breakfast included in the morning was fresh and well made and although my girlfriend and I always showed up at 930 or 935am (it closes at 930am) the accomodating staff always brought out additional fresh food and did not ever make it seem like the placed needed to be closed. ',GOOD,
'Upscale and Clean, Clueless Staff The room I stayed in really did look like the photos, quite nice and new. My room faced the back so it was very quiet, but even the street side is not very noisy.Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Check-in was easy.The staff was surprisingly clueless about the neighborhood. I asked about a cafe for a quick bite at 9 pm and the clerk had no idea where to go. Another time I asked for a close-by book store, and the clerk directed me to a store that had been out of business for some time.The immediate neighborhood is almost entirely residential and an easy walk to the Marble Arch tube, Hyde Park and Portman Square. Not many restaurant choices, but there's a convenience store about 2 blocks away. ',GOOD,
'great for family Based on other reviews, we stayed at the Sumner for 4 nights in June with extended family and were not disappointed. We booked a king room for more space to accommodate an extra bed for our child, which can be difficult to find in London at the Sumner's rates and quality. I can only echo other reviews in the comfort and cleanliness of the rooms, relatively peaceful and convenient location (including a grocery store within a block), and friendly and helpful staff. Definitely will stay here again! ',GOOD,
'Outstanding Boutique Hotel We stayed at the Sumner for a week in late June, 2007 after a recommendation from a friend. Charming boutique hotel, with great central location in London. Loved everything about the hotel, including breakfast, quality of room, terrific shower and bathroom.The staff was so accomodating, we felt like we were staying in our own private B  B.

'Lovely boutique hotel We stayed at the Sumner from July 2-5. This was our first trip to London so I researched many hotels on the internet before choosing this one. The taxi driver didn't know where it was and fortunately we had the street address because the only indication it's there is a small plaque next to the front door. The hotel has about 20 rooms in a converted townhouse. The configuration of the rooms is unusual, at least by US standards. We were in rooms 203 and 204, which were reached by taking the elevator to the first or third level (reception is on level zero and there is no stop on the second level) and walking up or down a few steps. It's not a problem for anyone who can walk the stairs. The rooms were sizeable and very comfortable for two people. Breakfast was included every morning and it was more than sufficient (eggs, bacon/bangers, beans, cereals, breads, cheese, juice, fruit, coffee or tea). The staff is excellent. The location was a couple of blocks from the Marble Arch tube stop and very convenient. We throughly enjoyed our stay at the Sumner and recommend it without hesitation. ',GOOD,
'Delightful and affordable jewel in London My husband and I stayed at the Sumner in early May for 6 nights as part of our 25th Anniversary celebration trip to London. We booked the Sumner just two weeks before our departure (prior arrangements at another location had fallen through), and Justina, the receptionist, was so accommodating and booked us a room that was perfect for us (#8). A recent renovation of the property has produced a lovely boutique-style hotel with a homey, welcoming feel. Our room was reasonably spacious by London standards and certainly more than adequate. The best part was the excellent and comfortable beds and pillows, great showers and the fact that everything was new and therefore in pristine condition. The rooms wisely include plugs in various voltages that precludes the need for adapters (so smart!) as well as a hair dryer, substantial, fluffy towels and a room fridge that was great for storing water and other snacks.The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. Breakfasts (included in the room rate, another plus in pricey London), was quite generous and a great way to start a busy day of sightseeing. Offerings included eggs, breakfast meat, beans, cold sliced meats and cheese, fresh fruit, toast, croissants, coffee, tea, juices, yogurt, cereals --- quite comprehensive by any standard. The location was an easy 3 block stroll from Marble Arch (Oxford St) and the Marble Arch tube. The neighborhood itself was semi-residential, so noise and the usual city hustle-and-bustle was kept to a minimum.All in all...we highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Very charming boutique hotel This small hotel appears to be fairly new. Everything wasspotless and contempory. Although the rooms are small, they were more than adequate concerning that most people don't spend too much time in their hotel room in London. The bathroom has a fabulous shower and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was accomodating even though we strolled in after midnight. The complementary breakfast was better than a typical continental breakfast(fresh fruit, toast to order, coissants, yougurt, meats, cheeses, eggs, sausage, andcereal. The location is close to Marble Arch which is centrally located. I plan on staying at this hotel when I return to London. ',GOOD,
'Kicked out of our Reserved Room!! I would have loved to share everyone's glowing reviews here about this hotel, as I had booked it for one night, but had tried several times to extend my stay. Although we were unsuccessful to extend our stay, we thought would at least be able to spend our last night of vacation relaxing at this seemingly beloved hotel. We checked in our bags early in the morning and were told that our room was not available until noon time. We didn't return until about 5 pm at which point, we were told that our room was not available because there was no water in the room, and that we would have to stay at another nearby hotel which was supposed to be comparable. No assistance was initially offered to help us to the hotel, and we were told that we had to invoice The Sumner for the difference in funds b/c the hotel they booked us in was more expensive than The Sumner. No compensation, reduction in fees, credit was offered. Simply, you will need to go b/c the room is not available....that along with an apology. No call was placed to us even though I had given out my cell phone to them when I had tried to extend my stay previously. They provided my credit card information to the other hotel without my permission despite EU's very strict privacy rules. Water could not be restored to my room despite the 5 to 6 hours they had to try to fix anything. To top it off, the room they booked us in was not comparable whatsoever. The room was very dirty, noisy (with a concert nearby), not a boutique hotel like The Sumner had advertised. This is a far cry from what I was expecting and unfortunately, I am not able to recommend The Sumner. ',POOR,
'Absolutely Charming! The Sumner Hotel was a very pleasant surprise, upon our arrival into London. It is a small, boutique hotel located just behind the Marble Arch, in Westminster. Location: The location is great. Just a few blocks from the tube's Marble Arch station, we were able to get anywhere in metro London in just minutes. There are a few pubs and a lot of middle eastern restaurants, nearby.Customer Service: The employees were very nice and accommodating. Justina was very friendly and helpful.Room: Our room was on the first floor, and was pretty good size, with a king-size bed, tv, desk and mirror. The bathroom was one of the best I've seen in a hotel. Huge tile shower with an overhead waterfall sprayer. Also, the hotel is on a quiet backstreet, so we rarely heard anything more than random cars and people.Extras: Breakfast is included, and while it wasn't a five star meal, pastries, juice and tea are always a nice start to the morning.All in all, we were VERY pleased with the Sumner, and were somewhat disappointed with the hotel we checked-into, in Paris, as it just didn't measure up to the Sumner.I highly recommend this hotel for the price, value and location. ',GOOD,
'What a great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed in a double room at the Sumner for two nights in May, 2007. The location was perfect, near the Marble Arch underground station. As far as the hotel and the room, this was definitely the nicest/most modern of the 8 hotels we stayed at on our Europe trip: LCD TV, modern bathroom, and very clean. The breakfast in the basement was also fantastic, with cereal, fresh fruit, some cooked items, etc. My only complaint concerned some loud Karaoke music we heard from outside on the first night--but reception said there was some sort of event going on in Kensington Park that night which may have been to blame. Assuming that is true (and there isn't a Karaoke bar a few doors down) I suppose I can't fault the hotel for that. While nothing in London is cheap, staying at the Sumner seemed like a good value for my $ compared to other hotels I researched. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel! My husband and I stayed here in February of this year. Overall, the hotel was pretty much perfect. The only downside would probably be the room size, but that was not an impediment to enjoying our vacation!LOCATION - the hotel is located near Marble Arch just off of Oxford Street. My husband and I are somewhat conflicted about the location, but in the end, we think it was a good choice. The hotel, although located just off Oxford Street, is a good walk (short tube ride) from the real heart of the City, Bond Street, Picadilly Circus, etc. On the other hand, it is centrally located if you consider that Notting Hill, Knightsbridge, etc. are to the west and southwest of the hotel and Hyde Park is just at your feet. Admittingly, we spent most of our time to the east and southeast, so being closer to that area (say Mayfair) would have worked out better. That being said, the hotel is NOT in a bad location. My husband and I walked just about everywhere, so the location was suitable.PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - the hotel is located a short walk (about 3-4 blocks) from the Marble Arch station on the Central Line. While convenient, the Central line is not the MOST convenient line to be on. We did quite a bit of transferring. Not a huge deal, just something to consider.ROOM - definitely small, but that's to be expected in London. My husband and I didn't stay in the room very much at all, we basically used it as a sleeping base, so a small room didn't matter much to us. If we anticipated staying in the room a lot (who does that in London), then it may have been a problem.RATE - we paid 85 pounds per night excluding taxes. Total, we paid 300 pounds for 3 nights, including taxes which equals about $197 per night USD. While not generally cheap, definitely the best value for the city we were in! The location was good, the hotel was brand new and clean and it included a free breakfast which was a bonus.BREAKFAST - breakfast was good. it included eggs, sausages, beans, cheese, cereal, juices, etc.GETTING TO THE HOTEL - we flew into Heathrow and took the 15 minute Heathrow Express ride (29 pounds one way, each person) to Paddington Station (runs every 15 minutes) and then from Paddington Station, we took a taxi to the hotel. Paddington Station is only a mile from the hotel, so the taxi fare was minimal. Between my husband and I and the taxi ride, the cost of transportation was about 65 pounds. This is probably about equivalent to taking a taxi directly from the airport, but it was a lot faster. The tube would have been the cheapest route, but likewise would have taken a while and with luggage, would not be ideal.INTERNET - there is one computer with internet access in the downstairs common area. We never had a problem getting on to use the computer. We also brought our laptop since there is free wireless internet in the rooms.SERVICE - everyone was very nice and helpful during our entire stay.ALL IN ALL - an excellent choice for our stay. We had a wonderful time in London and the hotel was perfect for our needs. ',GOOD,
'a top class small hotel As someone who has stayed in hotels in London regularly over the last 10-15 years this was definitely one of the better ones. As an all round experience I could not fault the standard of accommodation, the decor, the breakfasts or the friendliness/helpfulness of the staff. The hotel's location is excellent; only 5 mins walk from Marble Arch tube station and less than that from the Edgeware road restaurants  bars. Our rooms were well proportioned, comfortable and very clean with air conditioning that worked (not always the case in London). We also had 3 great night's sleep - uninterrupted by street noise -this is something special where hotels in London re concerned.I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be back.

'Boutique style at a great price! This little hotel offers boutique style at a great price, and a very convenient location just off Oxford Street to top that. My room was quite small and slightly impractical (nowhere to hang your towels and no safe) but these little lapses or imperfections are easily overlooked due to the utterly charming nature of the property itself and the staff that runs it. The breakfast, although very simple, is served with care and good service. It really feels as if you are staying as a guest in a London townhouse rather than a hotel. A very sympathetic and relatively stylish haven in Central London. I strongly recommend. ',GOOD,
'Great value We stayed only 1 night at Sumner but we really liked it a lot. Location is perfect, hotel staff is kind and polite. We stayed in a king double. The bed was extremely comfortable, duvet and pillows just like at home. Entering the hotel you can already feel how tidy and neat it is. The bathroom is spacious and amenities are good also. ',GOOD,
'Will stay there again! I have stayed at the Sumner Hotel twice now and found it to be a great value! It is clean w/lovey decor and a nice breakfast. The location is great for dinners out in Marylebone or a walk though Hyde Park to Notting Hill. And close to the Tube which is great too. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I read a previous review where someone complained about the mini bar only having water. I think this is the funniest thing to complain about. Within a 3 minute walk of the hotel, there is a darling Italian market and other conveniences. Mini bars just allow you to spend money on overpriced items! ',GOOD,
'This is a fantastic Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in April '07. We really liked it a lot! The location is great, very centrally located within London, and just about three blocks to the Marble Arch tube station, which is located on the Central Line. Its also just about four blocks to Hyde Park. It is a small hotel, located in what appears to be a renovated townhouse, and you almost feel more like you are staying in a little apartment rather than a hotel (but the rooms are hotel rooms, with a little fridge). The front desk staff were very nice and accomodating. The room was also very nice and sizable, with a flat screen tv, and a desk, along with a mini fridge. The bathrooms also look like they were recently re-done with a nice marble sink, however our room did only have a shower (no tub), I dont know if other rooms have tubs. They also have a nice breakfast included as well, with eggs and toast and beans and cheeses and meats and cereal... basically everything you'd want to start you on your day. Essentially this hotel is an excellent, pretty, well located hotel and we both enjoyed staying here immensly. ',GOOD,
'Great location Really nice small hotel, chic BB. Well located near to marble Arch. Good value for short stay. ',GOOD,
'Great Deal Excellent customer service at a great price! Townhouse small hotel, like a B  B, very modern and clean. Good-sized room with dreamy beds. Central heating made it too hot in the room, but the window opens. My room was quiet and at the back; the front rooms were noisy due to pedestrians walking by . Breakfast included, but the menu is the same every day (not a fan of bacon and baked beans). Tea/coffee 24/7 for only 1.5 pounds. I spent under 900 pounds for 8 days. Ride from LGW (Gatwick) by hired taxi from hotel was 85 pounds. Suggest going through Heathrow, which is closer and cheaper. Walking distance to Oxford St shopping, Marble Arch, and Hyde Park. Staff was very solicitous and always cheerful. ',GOOD,

'The best we have seen in London Our experience of hotels in London has until now been quite bad. But it has changed now.Due to:Good location very near Oxford Street.Very very nice newly renovated clean rooms (not very bit though).Two rooms chosen for our family according to our requirements that fitted us perfectly.Very nice staff.The breakfast was not huge but still one of the better we have experienced. Attentive and thoughtful.When in London next time we will return! ',GOOD,
''So' recommend The Sumner I have spent the last 20 years in staying in London hotels for both business and pleasure. It is such a refreshing change to have found a Hotel that has 'True London' character with all the refinements that go with 5* luxury.The decor is so opulent, the fixtures and fittings are the best I have seen anywhere. And as for breakfast...I want breakfast in that room every day...it is so refreshing  vibrant....!You can't even find a better location. It is so convenient for all Public Transport, but there are so many car parking spaces available all the time. Amazing for such a central area.What makes this place even better are the staff. I cannot thank them enough every time I stay.This is the only Hotel I will use when in London. The only problem I can see, is it's just so good, hence becoming so popular, I might not always get in...!!!I normally refrain from recommending any accommodation to people as I never know what their expectations are. However, I have recommended this to so many now and everyone has said it has been superb.Many thanks. ',GOOD,
'Sumner Hotel is in a great location We went to London for the first time for a 3 day stay and chose this hotel based on a recommendation from a friend. The location was perfect for catching transportation (buses, tube) to all of London's main central attractions. Some of them were even within a short 15-20 minute walk! The hotel was very clean and the rooms well maintained. The rooms were a fair size (especially by European standards) and quiet for the most part. Breakfast was served every morning and each guest had several items from which to choose.The staff was excellent is addressing any need we had and contacted a taxi so that we could get back to the airport on time. I would definitely stay at this property again. ',GOOD,
'perfect place... I felt like home. The best thing for me apart from the beatiful decoration, the lovely room, the nice bathroom, the kindness of the staff, was that when you arrived at the hotel you didn't feel like you were in the middle of such a big city like London. It's a perfect place to relax and enjoy London. Thanks again. ',GOOD,
'High Tech  This is a cool hotel. It marries high tech with style. Lifts to the rooms (almost no heaving luggage up narrow stairs), no keys to juggle (its a card system that is placed in front of a sensor), flat screen TV. Excellent location 3 min away from the marble arch tube and oxford street shopping. The service is genuinely friendly and competent, and the decor tasteful. They speedily located a manicurist for me along oxford street despite being busy. Its modern-victorian, sort of old style with a twist. Many lovely and unique spaces in the lobby and lounge that one can relax in , with internet access, a selection of books, a fireplace and view of the street. Good microspace creation manipulating light.I suspect the windows are soundproof, coz my room was totally silent! The bed was kingsize and very good, I slept like a baby. The bed must be something because I sleep on Simmons at home.I would recommend it highly :) ',GOOD,
'Super comfortable bed!       Bedroom at the Sumner ',GOOD,
'We were disappointed We'd always wanted to stay at the Sumner in S. Kensington but it was sold before we had the chance. We were happy to see it in a new (albeit not as desirable) location - the reviews here were good and the hotel looked lovely on the website. However, we were fairly disappointed.The decor is relentlessly modern - looks lovely, and everything is new, but it's not very practical. The chair in our room was so low it was a challenge to get out of it. The bed platform took a big chunk out of my shin in the middle of the night - lots of blood and I now have a scar - as it's got sharp corners that are unprotected by a mattress. We had a King bed, but since it would have been a design sin to have a king duvet (I guess it would spoil the aesthetic to have the duvet hang over the edges of the mattress) to stay covered you have to stay closer to the middle of the bed, thus defeating the point of a king - to sprawl out in a big bed.The toilet was positioned so that if you didn't sit far back, you'd burn your knees on the radiator which was directly opposite in a tiny space.Great chunks of sloppy caulking in the shower will result in some major mildew growth down the road, and the towel rail will almost certainly start pulling out of the tile wall.The ceilings are lovely and high with very nice moldings and are painted a lovely soft warm grey. As I say, everything at this writing is still nice and new.Breakfast was really good one day (great sausages) and not so good the next (rock hard eggs and weiners instead of sausages! We joked about eating weiners and beans for breaky).Something which really ticked me off was the lack of a bath in our room. I need to have a bathtub and so I had emailed the hotel a few times to confirm that our room would have a bath and shower. We even booked a higher category room to ensure we'd get a bath, and I have the replies saying of course our assigned room had a bath. Yet the room we were assigned on check in had no bath. When I brought this up with the woman on duty, she said she was sorry but this was the only room they had available. NOT IMPRESSIVE. The room did have a lovely big shower with all sorts of nooks and crannies (which served no purpose other than to look cool), and the overhead shower head was very nice, but I was not satisfied.We did not feel the hotel's location is that great. The nearest tube station is Marble Arch. It's close, but it's not a convenient stop as it only has the Central Line - so be prepared to transfer a lot. If you plan to spend lots of time on Oxford Street then the hotel is well-located for that, and there are some nice small pubs close by. The area has many, many small cheap hotels and BBs in it.If you like the Marylebone village area for shops and restaurants, it's within walking distance. We got a pretty good price for this hotel, and it wasn't a totally bad experience, but it was disappointing. We go to London every couple of years. We'll definitely return to the city but we will not return to The Sumner. ',POOR,
'Lovely New Year's Eve in London Booked this hotel on strength of reviews on this site.Hotel is located just off the Edgware Road and a short walk to Oxford Street, Selfridges, Hyde Park etc.The hotel is in a fairly quiet street. it is 2 converted town houses combined to form a hotel of 20 rooms so a nice size, not too big. The decor and furnishings are very modern, clean but welcoming. The lounge downstairs was ideal for a pre New Year's Eve drink -take your own there is no bar!We went with my wife's sister and husband who are used to the finest hotels around the world and they were very impressed. My sister in law described it as a country house hotel in the city which sums it up very well.We had booked deluxe rooms but i am sure the standard ones would be fine. Room wa slarge with lovely decor. The bed has to be the most comfortable ever in a hotel and after a heavy night it was a real struggle to get up.Breakfast was OK. Some hot food plus fruit, breads, etc buffet style.Staff were very helpful and polite.Overall, highly recommended.(For New Year's Eve we ate at Rodizio a Brazilian restaurant in Bayswater. Great fun and good value. Try it but get a table downstairs it was just too hot upstairs as this is where they chargrill all the lovely meat. ',GOOD,
'splendid oasis within the city! Joined my daughter and her friend at the end of their 3 month European adventure, which they spent in hostels and low-budget properties. Knowing that London starts at expensive and goes to outrageous, I tried to find a nicely located hotel with at least a 3 star rating (the Sumner is 4 star) and didn't break the bank. This place met, and exceeded, our requirements, not to mention our expectations!We spent 4 nights here after a rather disappointing 3 night stay in a budget property (more like a hostel so we could accommodate an additional friend for the first part of our visit). Our first impression was WOW!, as the lobby/living room is certainly an oasis in the very hectic, crowded city. The staff was quite gracious and professional even before we arrived, as they corresponded with me and made various reservations, etc. prior to our stay. They certainly didn't disappoint in any of their assistance. Check-in was a breeze.Our room, large by European standards, was scented of lavendar as we opended the door. The bathroom, though small, was adequate for three women. The beds were remarkably comfortable, as was the living room furniture. The breakfast was delightful, differing slightly every morning, and served with a smile. And free internet helped the girls catch up with friends and email before heading back to the US.Over all, the Sumner was a splendid way to see London, close to shopping, sightseeing, and dining. I will return and recommend this hotel to all family and friends. Enjoy!(PS: the hotel reserved a car for our early morning trip to Heathrow and it was $50 for all of us; and they came to our door, loaded the luggage, and dropped us at our gate! What a deal! Will definitely do this again!) ',GOOD,
'Perfect hotel We'll stay here on every trip! The hotel is in a great location, close to Oxford Square and a tube station. It was SO clean and simply decorated, plenty of room and super comfy duvets. Very quiet too. The staff made the trip for us. They were so nice and helpful. We wanted to stay another night but they were booked. They actually helped us find another hotel. (The Darlington was horrible compared to The Sumner, big disappointment). They also helped us with coach reservations to Canterbury even after we'd checked out. They couldn't have been nicer. They also put an internet booster in the stairwell so that I could get good wireless access in our room. Breakfast was great too and filled us up for a good part of the day, saving us money in this expensive city!The hotel made our stay! ',GOOD,
'Luxury and Location for a Great Price I've been to London 3 times in 2006, and stayed at 3 different hotels each time. The Sumner Hotel was my most recent stay. For the price (100-150 pounds), the Sumner is an excellent hotel. It's not the best hotel I've stayted at, but this price range is the hardest price range to find a decent hotel in London.The Sumner has nice rooms, a great location, friendly staff and an excellent breakfast.The Room:I stayed in a deluxe room, which is now called the Superior King, for 140 pounds a night including breakfast. The room was quite large for London (the 12 foot high ceilings helped) with a king sized bed, a small desk, a small refridgerator, a flat screen tv on mounted on the wall, a wicker bench and an armoire. The decor was modern and minimalistic. Not my taste exactly, but it was nice nonetheless. The room lacked a dresser, so unless all of your clothes hang, you pretty much are living out of your bag.The bathroom was small but functional. The bathroom only had a shower stall that was a tight fit for one, but it also had a great shower massager! The room and bathroom were very clean overall. My biggest complaint about the room is that the room (on the 2nd floor) faced the street, and every single noise outside could be heard rather clearly. It's not that bad since Upper Berkeley (pronounced BARK-lee) is a remote, generally quiet street.The big plus about the Sumner is the free wireless internet. London hotels generally charge 10-20 pounds for in-room internet access, which is not a nominal fee considering the weakness of the dollar. So this is a bug plus if you are travelling with laptop in tow. However, if you're travelling on business (like me), this is not the best place to be as their is no business center with printer/fax/copy capabilities (although I am sure could get that done by the staff if you needed). They do have a generally-available PC with internet access; this too is a plus as most hotels will charge a few pounds for 30 minutes access to a PC with internet.Breakfast:If you are a fan of strong coffee and English breakfast (runny eggs and some kind of meat - generally sausage), then you will be a fan of the Sumner's breakfast. Personally, I thought it was fantastic. They also have fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal and pastries. It's a great way to start the day. I am not sure how much extra the rate is with breakfast included, but it was worth it to me.Location:The Sumner is two blocks due north of Marble Arch station, which is at the tail end of the shopping district along Oxford Street. Selfridge's and MarksSpencer are within walking distance (or a quick bus ride), and Bond Street is walk-able as well. Marble Arch is on the Central Line, which is convenient if you are focusing on Central London. If you are going anywhere else, you'll need to transfer (not a big deal, but not as convenient as some other stations).The Sumner is also a 5 mintue cab ride (about 10 pounds) from Waterloo train station, so if you take the Heathrow Express to Waterloo and then a cab to the Sumner, it'll take you about 45 minutes and cost you about 25 pounds (this is a bargain and it's quick).The one downside to the hotel is that the area around Marble Arch severely lacks decent restaurants - even if you're looking for a quick bite or something casual - the choices are very limited. Staff:This is a boutique hotel and has more of a family-owned feel to it. I did not interact with the staff very much, but they were very friendly and helpful with the few things I did need. Overall:The Sumner Hotel is a great hotel for the price - it has nice, large, clean rooms and is in a good location convenient to most of Central London. You really can't get such luxury and location for under 150 pounds in London. However, if you can afford a few pounds more, I highly recommend the Park City Hotel (in the 150-200 pound range). It's in a better location and more luxurious for the price. My other stay this year in London was the Renaissance Chancery Court, which is absolutely fabulous, if you can afford the 300 pound/night room fare.My final word on the Sumner is that you can't go wrong if you stay here. Are there better places to stay? Absolutely, but the Sumner is rare in that it offers a great, luxurious place to stay at an incredibly affordable price. ',GOOD,
'Nice hotel       Bathroom ',POOR,
'nice hotel, great location My husband  I (from Chicago) stayed at Sumner for 4 nights. Being near Edgeware Road, Marble Arch and Oxford Street, this location is wonderful. The Bond Str. and Marble Arch tube stations are nearby and beautiful neighborhoods are steps from the door. We've stayed in London a number of times, at fancier places (including Browns and The Langham), and this is definitely one we'll go back to in the future.The room was big, the service pleasant and breakfast adequate enough to get you through the morning. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'99,80% score !! Just returned from the Sumner, we stayed there just for one night. Looking for a nice hotel we finally booked this hotel based on previous revieuws. We booked it directly on the sumner-website, (discount, final total amount was Epound 116!!) the smaller room.The space between the end of the bed and the wall is not very wide, but wide enough to walk. Room is 100% clean and wonderfull decorated, it is exactly like the pictures! Provided with a large wardrobe, good bed (it's higher than normal, lenght of the bed is ok; husband is 6.2 feet no problem), clean carpet. (I always hate it when there are strange stains on floors in hotel rooms). Nice and clean linnen. Bathroom is adequate with a very nice shower ! Minor thing was the temperature; too hot!! Which was easily altered by changing the airco and opening a window. Another small minor thing was the breakfast-room; it's pretty small but no one had to wait to be seated. But these two issues are the only negative points about the hotel. Hotel is located in a very nice and save location. Staff is indeed very friendly; they checked our flight (Heathrow fog) and we were allowed to leave our suitcase behind in the hotel the next day, for a couple of hours. Everything with a sincere smile.We will definitely return here ! ',GOOD,
'Stunning!       LCD TV ',GOOD,
'Very Good Hotel For The Money Stayed here for 4 nights and found it to be a very good hotel for the money. I do think that it would in fact be hard to beat for the money. The hotel is close to The Marble Arch tube stop which would not be my first choice in London but it was relatively close to theatre, Harrod鈥檚 and Chelsea which having been to London before was what I came for this time. Also being Marble Arch the restaurants were alittle cheaper than in other areas which the few times we ate in the area was nice.The hotel has a very nice parlor or sitting room with a computer and free internet. The computer will print out documents to the nearby front desk printer and there is no charge. The sitting room also has a sofa and several chairs and guide books to London. It is right at street level facing the street so you see people walking by and cars which I enjoyed. There is also a gas fireplace in the sitting room which makes it very pleasant. We had tea and biscuits served to us a few nights in the sitting room for a very nominal fee which was very very nice.We had the king bedded (larger) room facing the street. Everything about the room was quite nice鈥︹€?comfy bed, decent pillows, very clean and flat screen tv. The tv was in an odd spot, on the wall to the right of the bed, which made watching it a bit of a strain. The chairs in the room were not terribly comfortable. I would take exception with a previous reviewers comment that there were only 2 items in the mini bar in that it is not actually a mini bar. Rather it is a refrigerator for guest use in which they provide one flat and one fizzy water I believe at no charge. Diagonally across the street is a grocery store, which always seemed to be open, where you can buy whatever you want, at decent prices, and put it in the refrigerator. There is no gym however there are two Marriot鈥檚 nearby where you can use their facilities for a fee (the older one at Marble Arch has better facilities as it has been redone) although at both hotels they didn鈥檛 charge me鈥︹€t seemed to be more trouble to the staff than it was worth.I do agree that the walls are very thin between the rooms and that would be my only major criticism. We could hear the guests next door using the toilet which was somewhat of an annoyance. When there were loud guests in the room next door we heard more. I would not recommend this hotel for younger people who might want to stay out late and go clubbing and then sleep in the next day鈥?you鈥檒l disturb people coming in late at night and I do think it might be difficult to sleep in although we did sleep from 11AM to 5PM one day because of jet lag with not much trouble.A full breakfast at this price was a nice addition. I have had better hotel breakfasts but also worse and for the money I thought this breakfast was quite nice鈥︹€ggs, meat, cheese, cereals, juice, coffee, tea, cumber slices, scones, muffins. A very friendly staff and guests made this quite a nice stay. From the moment I called the hotel from Los Angeles with help with finding the best Indian Restaurant in town that we would enjoy (top food with friendly service and relatively informal) I knew I made the right choice. That restaurant was Chutney Mary鈥檚 by the way which we really enjoyed.I would probably return to this hotel if it continues to offer such good rates. There is a lot to be said for the small boutique hotels in my book, where there are friendly staffs and nice communal rooms. However if the rates rose by a fair amount I would be tempted to check out some choices in Covent Garden and the Kensington area. ',GOOD,
'Good experience The Sumner was more or less as I expected, which is a good thing. The hotel is clean, decently located (close to Marble Arch tube), relatively spacious (as far as London goes) and has a great staff. The price was very good as well.The only outright negative was the too-thin walls/ceiling, making it hard to sleep in (if that's your choice). I wasn't a big fan of the breakfast, but others seemed to enjoy it. The wireless internet could have worked a little better in the room, but the fact that it was free entirely made up for it. ',GOOD,
'New favorite hotel in London I booked this hotel online and expected a nice place, but the Sumner was a fantastic new find. The rooms were comfortable and stylishly decorated, the bathrooms were modern, the beds extremely comfortable, the breakfast very tasty and the location is great. Would stay here again definitely and totally recommend. I would say you can't get better for the money for a boutique hotel in London right now. ',GOOD,
'A very comfortable stay A lovely five night stay at the Sumner. Prompt service, nice breakfast, good sized room, contemporary furnishings, everything very clean, very tasteful. A sedate boutique hotel with nice detailing. Easy walk to tube stop, to Hyde Park and to shopping in Marylebone village. One watchout...my partner and I were first in a room on the basement level. The room was huge (even had a nonworking fireplace) if somewhat underfurnished. However, the bed was right under the first floor drawing room and computer table, so lots of walking and chair moving overhead late at night. The next morning,the hotel gladly moved us to a top floor room. It was a little smaller, but quieter and still very comfortable. Would definetely stay at the Sumner again. ',GOOD,
'Great boutique hotel I agree with other recent reviews. The hotel was gorgoues and very London! The rooms everything you needed. They were modern, comfortable, spotlessly clean and the staff were incredibly helpful. The breakfast room was very sweet too. My only comment would be that a twin room is just a king bed split into two, not two doubles as I thought it would be.The pub two doors away was fantastic and it was great to be able to have a quick beer or dinner by yourself in a genuine London pub 30 seconds from the hotels front door. I highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Very nice, not perfect Did only stay for one night, so my experience is limited. Positiv; Location is good for al the touristy places and Hyde Park which is great anyway. The decor is quite nice if not that cool. Big bed! Quite ok bathroom. Free internet. Very helpfull and nice concierge...Negative: The minibar contented only 2 bottles of water, that's it! I thought this was a mistake but when I called the consierge he confermed that was normal. Not a big thing, but I wanted a coke... Internet worked very slow if at all (wifi). Bed was very big, but not very good. The bathroom is small for the price.All in all I liked the place, especially the 篓living room篓. But after reading all these amazing reviews I was a little dissapointed. ',GOOD,
'a pleasant discovery in London jungle I stayed at Hotel Sumner four nights on business travel. Find a decent and not very expensive accommodation in central London is not an easy job. I read some reviews on Trip Advisor and then I chose to try the Sumner thanks to its location, two minutes' walk from Marble Arch tube station. And I did not regret of my choice. The hotel has a cozy, familiar atmosphere since you step into. Enjoy the sitting room giving on to the street. It's really pleasant.My room (Queen Double Room for single use) was clean, well equipped, with LCD screen, and surprisingly silent. Bathroom is clean and functional. The receptionists are friendly and ready to help you with information (there is also a list of suggested restaurants on a desk), as well as the lady serving breakfast which is situated below groundfloor. Breakfast is not very English as you may expect but it is totally enough (especially for an Italian), with cereals, pastry, toast and scrambled eggs. Pastries were not fresh. But nobody is perfect. I recommend the Sumner Hotel for a short or long stay in this crazy fascinating city ',GOOD,
'The Sumner is excellent! I just got back from a trip to London, and loved the Sumner. The staff is extremely efficient and courteous (and make good restaurant reccommendations), and the hotel itself is pretty much brand new and everything you could ask for for 99 pounds a night. The rooms and bathrooms are a decent size - and everything is sparkling. The beds are extremely comfortable -which maybe isnt such a good thing - since it made it harder to actually get up! Ha. ha. Each room has a plasma TV with digital cable which also made it hard to leave the room as TV in the UK is quite addicting. The shower was a nice size and had great water pressure - and yes, there are Gilchrist and Soames soaps and shampoos in a cute little basket in each room!The breakfast room is modern and adorable, and the English breakfast that was included was definitely enough to fill you up.The lounge is comfortable, and has a computer for your use, and almost every London guidebook that is out there....and as for location, you can't beat Marble Arch - and The Sumner is literally a 3 minute walk from the Marble Arch tube station...and Hyde Park!I would definitely reccommend staying at the Sumner, and I would gladly stay there again - as I almost was sad to leave! It really is a perfect little hotel. ',GOOD,

'Beautiful scenery.... The grounds on this hotel are beautiful and well cared for. The rooms are okay. The towels are pretty worn and sometimes smelled like fish!!! The bed was hard and the pillow lumpy. But do you go to spend time in your room???? Lots of hot water for a shower and the room was well cleaned everyday. The beach is breathtaking and people very friendly. If you are looking for nightlife this is not the place. There is a disco but locals are allowed in so make sure you go in a group. You only get free drinks between 11 and 12, other than that it is expensive. The buffet was good, lots to choose from. The pools are beautiful - only one swim up bar so this pool is always the busiest. I would recommend this hotel - but if you want super luxury - not for you. ',GOOD,
'Not loving it WOULD NOT GO BACK.......luckily we had great friends with us.........THis hotel is soooo not a 4 star. More like a 2 starno one speaks english there........only spanish or french........1 of our 3 rooms had no air conditioning and no one would help us. Then the last night the same room leaked water on one of the beds. there are 2 free restaurants in this resort....but by the time you figure out where they are or how to book them you give up! The others are a charge of a min. $11 US pp. The kids club is terrible............we had 5 kids with us ranging from 5 to 13 and they lasted 15 min there before they returned to us! The entertainment staff didnt come out til x mas eve.......no schedules on entertainment etc. The room was ok............clean....showers had no pressure though. The beach was beautiful....however my kids personally are not beach kids........so we went to the pools (3 of them) every day...however they were freezing .....so I as the mother only went in 2x the whole week.there is really nothing to do at night......so we ended up sleeping at around 9ish....which is fine b/c if you dont get up early you miss the sun!!!!!!if you tip the waiters in the buffet you get good service.......as we were 11 ppl so we got our table saved every morning..... I recommend the banana juice and the crossaisants...yumI would never go back.....................the language barrier is very frustrating......and the kids were bored!!!!!!!!! ',POOR,

'Loud modern disco terror Close your eyes and think about the white beach, wind, palm sea, waves and dream away. Then BOEM BOEM BOEM welcom to the club says a dark voice very loud in the big speaker boxes.This is the start tune of a 4 times per day session to activate the people for aquagym and other activities of the animation team.You can hear it all over the resort and beach. Away is your dream, your concentration in your book, or you maybe even were snoozing away on your holiday.No way, the animation team is there for the 1 to 3 persons who like it.This is terrible. If you stay there longer, you can dream it. Most people we spoke did not like it at all, but let it happen. We tried to speak about it with the 18 year old animation team leaders, but this was without result.A manager was able to arrange one normal morning without the BOEM BOEM BOEM of the modern disco terror. Only the volume was fast pushed to there usuall level later that day. The only ascape was to find a place 150 meters from the animation mosk and bars. One day with a lot of wind we tried to stay near the pool. Impossible to do something other than listen to disco music and other different music, at the same time!!!, from the animation, the pool bar and beach bar.We left the resort that day to find some rest because our room was near the pool. Even in the room you could not relax or read a book.Looking for a disco, go to the tropical princess.Want a Carribean relax holiday, find an other resort. ',POOR,
'Loved the hospitality Punta Cana Tropical PrincessDate: Sept 6--13 , 2008Just returned with memorable experience. The hotel is the best I have had of all my vacations. The overall service was incredible--be it the check-in , the bus, the ground , the pool , the maid , the bar and the restaurant staff was beyond expectation. There is nothing to complain about and definitely my hotel for next year with my entire family.The beach was cleaned every morning and with the golden sand beneath my feet it was something to experience.On a scale of 1 to 10, I will give Tropical Princess a 15. ',GOOD,
'Before you book READ THIS Ok then before i go on im gonna break this down for you all and then you can make your own decision so firstly boys and girls if your sitting comfortably.....Ill begin.1. AccomodationAccomodation was absolutely top notch, ive been to the Dominican before and this was the bet ive ever seen, the main area was a split level room with the dining room on the bottom level, it had sattelite TV with a lot of english speaking channels and a fridge that was stocked every day with beer, water and pop. there was loads of cupboard space in this area and also a settee. in the top level there was a double queen size bed with lamps on either side and a fan above the bed. The area leading into the Bathroom was full of mirroed wardrobes which also included a safe (no fee) in this area there was a large sink area with all round wall to wall mirrors...good for checking if youd tanned ya [----]. the rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and the air con was freezing, lovely after a hot day in the sun.2. FoodThe main resteraunt was bloody brilliant with lots and lots of choice, for anyone who didnt want to try something a little different there was an American station with your typical American food Burgers, Pizza etc. The resteraunts which were all inclusive were also good but were difficult to book (3 days advance was the norm) not once did anyone i know get a bad tummy off the food. there is lots of different little resteraunts on the beach were you get food at anytime throughout the day and at midnight they do snacks in the main resteraunt.3. EntertainmentOh dear this is were it all started to go wrong, quite simply they do not cater for ANYONE who speaks English...If you can speak spanish then thats fine, can you speak itallion then thats ok too, maybe you speak german french or russian well thatll do nicely! not once did i hear the night time entertainment speak English and this [----] me off no end, i had a 13 boy with me and to keep a teenager entertained when there was no other English speaking kids was difficult. At the bar the staff would make a point of serving the spanish first and when they did serve you it took ages to order anything because of the language barrier.4. Things to do. The beach was gorgeous and the water was crystal clear, the sand was golden and was constantly being cleaned, we didnt spend much time round the pool as it was full of jonny foreighners stareing and gawping, we found one English family out of about 600 people so to that end we were definately in the minority. The full time we were there the everyone that was not english speaking was rude arrogant and would not apologise for anything even if they knocked into my kid.....to which i give an explicit lesson in english to one guy. The trips that we paid for were top class...The 4 wheel drive buggys are a must, and the trip on the boat to watch the sunset with dinner was ace....DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BOOK TO GO SEA FISHING....spoke to loads of english on route out and they done the same and didnt catch a thing...it is just used as an excuse for the fishermen to go trawling with nets and make some wxtra cash.Looking back it was nice to get away for a couple of week in the sun but given the choice again i would definately NOT go back to the east of the island and instead go back up north to puerto plata again were there is lots of englsh speaking friendly people. I spoke to quite a few Canadians who had the same problems as myself and got told a story of one couple that were that disgusted in the way they were treat by the foreighners they moved hotels at there own cost.If you dont mind getting treat like a mug off the staff and anyone who doesnt speak the queens english then this is the place for you.......enjoy! 5.

'Aug26-Sept 2 Honeymooners and Loved it! Honeymooners! WOOHOO...We liked Tropical Princess a lot!!Ignore all the comments of the bad things. Things do happen but make the best of your trip.I won't lie we did have problems. Our toilet clogged on us the first day and so did our tub but they fixed it right away and were great about it. they called to see if someone was there and then later on they would call to check to see if it was still working okay. That was good of them. The rooms were nice...maids were awesome..and the beaches are so nice..the food is good. Lots to choose from, different themes every night. Josie the bartender at the pool was awesome. Made your time a blast. I would definatly recommend this hotel to ppl. We had a blast and met some pretty fun ppl too... So go expecting to have a great time, and if you run into problems..so what..don't let it put a damper on your vacation..enjoy, soak up the sun and if you do go here...we are jealious! Have a blast..oh and don't forget to pack the sunscreen or Aloe Vera!!! :o) ',GOOD,
'Absolutely loved this hotel We have just returned and have to say after reading the reviews I was really anxious and spent the weeks leading up to going dreading it, to the point that I rang our tour operator to let them know that a bug had been reported at this hotel and also my concerns about the food, as people were saying it was awful. Our tour operator rang the hotel to speak to the Rep and they knew nothing of it, so that was reassuring.When we arrived, we were greeted by lovely staff, the hotel was really beautiful, to me it was paradise, and the food was just out of this world. We had the most amazing time at this hotel and all I can say is that some people are just not easily pleased. I just could not fault anything about this hotel at all. It really was such a joy to stay at this hotel and we could even go out at 9.30am and still get a sunbed and under the shade which was such a bonus.I would strongly recommend that you do not take too much notice of the bad reviews.I would go back to this hotel tomorrow. ',GOOD,
'Great place to relax I spent a week at the Tropical Princess with my Mum in July and we both had a great time. We went for a week of relaxation and that's what we got.The buffet restaurant was great with a different 'theme' every day (e.g. Mexican, Chinese, Italian etc) and the waiters were all charming. The other restaurants didn't seem as busy as the buffet restaurant and we stuck with the buffet as there was so much variety. The beach is lovely but on one day the water got a little rough. However, if you turn left out of the hotel on to the beach and walk for 5 mins you reach a really calm stretch of sea. The grounds are kept immaculately clean by a huge team of gardeners and the rooms are very spacious and clean (with no bugs of any kind!). There are 3 large outdoor pools which are great for families with kids, or for a dip after a day on the beach. There is a small gym with 2 treadmills, 2 rowing machines, 1 stepper, some weights machines and free weights. It opens at 8 so we got there at that time everyday to make sure we could get on the treadmills. There is also a beauty salon where you can get lots of different treatments. I could not recommend this place more highly if you simply want to relax on a beautiful beach. However, if you are wanting to see something of Dominican culture, you might want to go to the North of the island where there seemed to be a bit more going on. ',GOOD,
'Fabulous! We stayed at the Tropical Princess from 22 July to 5th Aug 2008. Family of 4 (2 teenage sons aged 16 and 14). We had the most fantastic time despite being worried about some of the reviews before we went. The hotel room was spacious and clean, maid service every day - clean towels etc. The food in the main Buffet Restaurant was extensive and I defy anyone to not find something they like amongst the array of varied food. The grounds of the hotel are immaculate and are tended all day every day - green and lush. The setting (on the beach) is like a picture postcard with white sands, palm trees and blue warm sea. Yes, the entertainment is in different languages but then there are different nationalities visiting. What a lot of people don't realise is that after the main show (near the lobby) all the dancers etc. descend on the Lobby Bar where there is dancing etc until midnight. We only found this out after a few days - I thought the only reason you went to the Lobby was if you needed something from reception. DO NOT be put off by bad reviews - they worried me sick before we went. You will have a fabulous time. Room problems could be had anywhere in the world and anyone who did have this problem were just unlucky. On the whole, everyone we spoke to had a fantastic time with no complaints - sickness included. We all would love to go back next year especially my 2 sons who made some great friendships. Enjoy!!!

'Paradise Found! 17-31 July, 2008. We are a family of four with a son of 12 and a daughter of 10 from London, UK. We have previously read lots of reviews of the Tropical Princess, some good and some bad. All those people who were not happy with the resort need to seek help 鈥?where have you been before? The room was superb, the maid service even better, food and waiters were well beyond our expectations, pools and beach clean and fantastic. The weather was superb for 14 days, and we had an absolute blast. We ate at the buffet and could always find something interesting and delicious 鈥?full marks there! We would cheerfully have stayed another month without running out of things to do and all were very sad to return home (yesterday!).We loved speaking (dreadful) Spanish to the staff and were very grateful for their enthusiasm and assistance. We admired the animation (entertainment) staff who worked all day then moved to the Serenata Theatre to entertain us in the evenings.With regard to Thomson, I am not sure that we would book with them again. The flight to Punta Cana was good and the transfers on time but advice from the resort rep proved inaccurate and expensive. A big deal was made of the Anton Zilli food, which turned out to be stewed sausage and mash or inedible pasta. The flight home was bitterly cold, devoid of any explanation but with lots of blankets distributed. ',GOOD,
'not the holiday paradise promised my husband and I stayed here in June 2008 and I can honestly say I wish we hadn,t bothered.The beach is fantastic which is just as well because there is nothing else to do all day. The organised activities are an absolute shambles. If you are not fluent in Spanish you will never know what time anything is on. our room smelt damp and all the towels were a fetching shade of grey! food is barely edible. Please don,t eat in the Dominican resteraunt. We did and by the next night were both ill with stomach cramps and the trots. there is nowhere to go outside the complex unless you are on an organised excursion. I,m so glad we did that because it meant we had one good day out of our week . I,m really pleased we weren' t there for a fortnight.from Beverley from Newcastle. ',POOR,
'Do not book this hotel (nightmare) On arrival at our hotel room I filled our sink with water to get washed and we found that there was no lever on the tap to release the waste from the sink this was reported on 01/07/2008 and was advised by reception this would be done the same day. The sink had not been fixed by the Wednesday 2/7/2008 when we went to see Claire our rep and we advised her of this and she said she would get it sorted which she didn鈥檛 this was not fixed until our 11th day on the complex even though it was first reported on 1/7/2008 he had to get down on both knees two-three times a day after we had been washed to empty the sink this had him in some pain for most of the holiday. We also booked 3 trips with Claire Animal Adventure Park which would cost us 240 dollars, Saona Island which cost 304 Dollars and the Monster Truck Safari which was 198 Dollars both the Saona Island and the Monster Truck Safari was confirmed by Claire to be a free bar with all kinds of drink. On the Animal Adventure Trip my partner ordered a beef sandwich which actually turned out to be corned beef and I ordered a Tuna Sandwich both of these were warm as they had been left in the sun which unfortunately I did have to eat as I suffer from Type 1 insulin controlled diabetes which later on that afternoon I suffered a stomach upset due to this which made be unwell for approx 48 hours we then went to Saona Island on 3/7/2008 where we were told that we would travel by speed boat and then by paddle boat to the island this was not to be the case as we were advised that the paddle boat was faulty but when we turned up to the area to change transport there was a paddle boat there that was in working order. I also found out that there were no diet drinks and you were unable to buy any on these 2 trips to Saona island and The Monster Truck Safari I ended up drinking water all day after the trips were sold as all drinks included. The Monster Truck Safari if you could call it that was 3 stops all day and was more like a bus ride, to my knowledge a safari is a trip on land, usually in jungle or savanna environments, which is engaged in for the purpose of viewing or hunting animals. Most often, the modern safari involves viewing, photographing, and experiencing animals in their natural habitats. There was certainly no viewing of animals unless you are classing horses and pigs in people鈥檚 gardens a safari so to me this was being misadvertised. We were also plagued by the Trip advisor for cash on the Monster Truck Safari as they were calling it he was constantly asking for cash to help the poor little children and people who have nothing which made the tourists very uneasy and as if we had to give whatever we had to help these people. Without sounding awful we all have to work for our living the same way everyone else does but they thought because we were British that we had a lot of money and all of this should have been given to them not the fact that we have to work all year round to pay for our holiday abroad. All I ate for 2 weeks was rice and sweetcorn while I was there as the food that was being served you were unable to make a full meal out of. We were also plagued by ants outside of our room which nothing was done about this either. Be under no illusion this is definitely not a 3 plus hotel in fact it would be lucky to get a rating of a 2* as they are unable to keep the area clean we had birds flying in the restaurant and on one night a rat in the pool which the pools were never cleaned so god knows what diseases people could catch.

'Very Average Hotel First impressions were very good, lovely setting.First room not good, were moved on request but next room was very tired looking, bedcovers had mould on them, pillows were filled with what felt like cotton wool balls, towels were grey, we all fought over the one white towel, complained but not much action, were offered another room change but did not want to keep unpacking and packing. Rat in pool on first morning . The staff at certain poolside bars were very unfriendly and children were kept waiting ages until served, very unhelpful. Shop staff also looked as if they couldn't be bothered. Hygiene in main restaurant and Creperie appalling, decidedly average food choice. A few nights we had to que to get in main restaurant. Mexican and Italian restaurants were very good and efficient service. Due to giving of free alchohol at swim up pool bar, it got very loud and out of hand and one fight was seen, not a pool for children. Night entertainment on too late, the list is endless. Good points were the beach, very Carribean. Won't be rushing back. ',POOR,

'2 weeks is too long! The Good...Amazing beaches, warm clean water and soft sand at your feet. Large rooms with great air conVery friendly Dom Rep people, hotel staff  localsMonster Trucks excersions - great fun and really interesting to get out of the resort and see some real Dominican lifeHelpful Thompson RepThe Bad...Beds are unbelievably uncomfortable - like sleeping on bricks for 2 weeksThe food was bland, boring and monotonous, which some may expect from an all inclusive, but i have had much better!Absolutely nothing to do in the evenings unless you like watching shows in Italian or Spanish!The Saona Beach trip is highly over-rated and very expensive for what it is. The island itself could be very beautiful if it wasn't for the fact that thay pack as many tourists onto the beach who then make the beach dirty and untidy - big disappointment!Both my husband and myself suffered with a stomach upset and bad cramps for about the first 10 days of our holiday - and from what we heard from the few other English we managed to speak to - so did they! Take lots of imodium its 拢10 a pack at the resort!Warning - if you do excersions take a sick bag on the coach, we had a number of people who were sick on our excersions as the roads are so bumpyThe Ugly......This resort is not catered for English clients, on the whole we felt completely alienated the whole time we were there as the Peurto Ricons/Italians/Germans took over the whole resort. This got really annoying and we wish we could have come home after the 1st week of our 2 week holiday ',POOR,

'toilet heaven Dont get me wrong, the hotel and grounds and beach were beautiful, it was very clean and the staff were really good. There were plenty of spanish reps keeping their guests entertained however if you travel with Thomson there is only one rep and you never see her. The kids clubs are poor, i went once and was told by the lady running it who could not understand much English that she did not have enough kids so she was not just taking mine into the club. I was also advised that this would be a great place to take my kids to swim with dolphins, however when i got there i was told my children were too young for any of the trips we wanted to do. However it was the food which ruined the holiday, the quality is poor, there was obviously some sort of food poisioning in the hotel, people were in hospital some were flying home, some were even flying to America as a means of escape. Everybody I spoke to was ill and it ruined the holiday completely. They was testing the water in the pools because we saw them taking samples. In my opinion due to whatever bug was making everybody sick we should have been moved. This said, had the food been okay then we would not have been ill and the holiday would have been good. Do not venture out of the resort, you will be offered drugs and/or prostitutes ',POOR,
'The Good and the Bad...more good than bad though! I went to the Tropical Princess for a week in early may with 7 girlfriends - we had just all graduated from university so we were extremely excited for everything!Our rooms were nothing special. We had requested two rooms close to each other but on the first night we were in separate buildings. We changed rooms in the morning, it was a slight downgrade from our previous room, but right across the hall from our friends. The rooms aren't very well kept, the towels are dingy, one of our toilets did not work, and the overall quality of the space is sub par. Unluckily for us, our two rooms were in between 4 other rooms of 16 year old students from Peru...meaning LOUD late nights, banging on the doors at 4am, yelling in the halls. We had called security but they did not do anything. We requested to switch rooms toward the end of our trip but they never switched us. Our last day at the resort wasn't so great...we had tried to get a free late check out since we had put up with so much with this teenagers and some rude staff but the manager, Ingrid, did not help us at all. It is $35 for a late check out til 3pm, and then 65$ until 5pm. Our bus to the airport was at 5pm. To make a long story short, she wouldn't budge, we didn't get the free late check out, and we left the resort with some feelings of resentment towards Ingrid and some of the other staff at the resort.There were good parts to the resort though!!! The grounds are beautiful! The pools are great - there are 3 but we only used the one with the swim up bar. Jose, one of the bartenders was hilarious and made the best 'dirty monkeys'. Highly recommend you try them. The beach was incredible...no seaweed, white sand, the water was clear and there were loads of beach chairs available all the time. The 'Animation' staff (the entertainers) were entertaining but got a little creepy and annoying after awhile. I guess you have to expect that when you're with 7 other women.The food was decent. We mostly ate at the main buffet...tons of choices but the food is kind of bland. They have themed dinners at night and the Mexican and the Oriental nights are great. We ate at the Brazillian a la carte one night, it was okay, but not so great for our vegetarian friend. The drinks were great!! No matter your tolerance, you'll be buzzed in no time. Alcohol was available 24/7 I believe, at the beach bar, but don't quote me on that. You HAVE to try the Mamajuana shots, you'll learn to love them. The disco at the resort was pretty good, lots of locals after 11pm, but the free drinks end at midnight. Overall it was an amazing vacation! I'd recommend it if all you care about is the beach, pool, and the booze! We met lots of people from Canada, the States, France, Austria, England...everywhere. I guarantee you'll have fun if you go.

'Great Beach, Nice Hotel, But Overall KInda Bland I stayed at Tropical Princess from April 10 - 17. Overall it's very nice. Hugh lobby. Large grounds (sometimes too large for my likeing) Fantastic Beach. Very nice pools and as far as buffets go - pretty good.You could walk for literally MILES on that beach...... So if a great beach is one of your priorities ---- Punta Cana is a good choice. My room is decent... just a normal average room.... small mini fridge. They supplied bottled water, coke , sprite daily. Had to pay $5 a day for in room safe. The cost was ridiculous, most hotels offer this for free... but u gotta keep your valuables safe,, so u pay. Pillows are okay, some need replacing, The bed was extremely HARD!!!! My back was in muscle spasism, the muscles in my butt and thigh were sore from sleeping on that rock called a bed. I was not happy with the bed.Pools were very nice.. Three to choose from. max of 4' deep and oone end was wade in.... very good for those who take small children.Buffet.. large variety. but it was the same variety every day.... Unfortunately I do not know if it was the water or something I ate but I was extremely sick the last nite there.... Make sure you take Imodium and Gravol with you.. It saved my life!!The grounds are huge. It's a long walk from the lobby to the rooms/pool/beach area. Beautiful grounds but my preference next time would be a smaller resort with everything conveniently located closer together. They use golf carts to courier you back and forth you u dont want to enjoy the walk in the heat (and it was very hot!)Overall - not one of my better vacations.. I have travelled south more than a dozen times.... This was the very first time I was ever sick. My preference is Cuba or Mexico over Dominican Republic. This was third time to Dominican, and probably my last for a long time. ',POOR,

'It's also the Caribe Club Princess Firstly, the Tropical Princess and the Caribe Club Princess are the same, the only difference is that one offers you 3 extra visits to the Al-la-carte restaurants, the main food hall, swimming areas, clubs for kids etc are all the same.Off to a very bad start from the moment we arrived at the hotel, the room upgrade we'd paid for wasn't available. Hotel receptionist refused to believe us, the rep wasn't much help either saying that Thompson in the UK don't inform them of anything. According to the receptionist, the room we had upgraded to didn't exist. It was only when my wife managed to dig out the confirmation paperwork did the rep believe us and hey presto...the room we had upgraded to did not only exist but there was one available.On arrival in the room, we were extremely disappointed. The sheets were a dirty grey colour and very creased (as if recently slept in??), blankets were old, worn and threadbare. There was a very large water stain on the ceiling above the bed in the main bedroom, both wardrobes in both rooms, the doors were either stuck fast and couldn't be moved or hanging off. The main door had a large gap between the frame and the space in the wall. After further investigation, while walking through the hotel, it was noticeable that this condition was present in most of the rooms.Used a total of 7 magnetic keys during the 1 week stay as there were continual problems gaining entrance to the room.Had to complain en-masse with others who arrived on the day we did, to get a safe key, had to carry all valuables with us for the first 24 hours and then the only way we could get a safe key was to pay for the whole week. $24 for a service which is free in most other hotels.The food was very boring and offered little change each evening, felt very sorry for those who were there for 2 weeks. Couldn't confirm it but on the day before we left, I thought I had seen a rat in the eating area.The rep was rarely on site, not her fault entirely as Thomson had given her 7 other locations to look after / supervise.Thomson on site had no record of the flight upgrade we had paid for and we were told it was not possible to have only requested an upgrade for the return overnight flight. Had to make a call at our expense to have Thomson UK fax the confirmation to the hotel so a copy could be given to the rep.The rather large Thomson rep at the airport also didn't believe we had upgraded and had another rep check on this.The pool areas were very nice though, it has to be said, three very large pools with plenty of sun bed availability. Easy access to the beach where there were also plenty of sunbeds.In 2007 we had stayed further north at the Riu Mambo, also a Thomson resort, spend the few extra 拢's and stay there instead, it'll be worth it and something we wish we had done.

'Beautiful Resort We stayed at the Tropical Princess on March 20-27, 2008. It was great! We flew out with SunWing and everything went smoothly. We arrived around 10pm and our departure flight was at 9pm. The only complaint we had is that the resort should allow you stay in your room until at least 3 or 4pm (with no charge) if you have a late flight. Their policy is that you have to be checked out by 12noon. Our bus did not pick us up until 5pm! We did get an extended time in our room until 3pm but we had to pay $35.00 extra. But all in all.. considering that this is a 4 star resort we were very satisfied. Everything is withing walking distance. The beach is pretty close to all the roooms. The only problem we had with our room was the pillows... we should have asked for replacements but kept we forgetting. By midweek we didn't bother.I seen one mosquito in our room all week. I never seen any outside. We went to 2 of the nightly shows and they were okay. Otherwise we were pretty pooped and went to bed early the other nights.The buffet had a really good variety...something for everyone. We went to the Brazillian resturant one night.. it was pretty good.We went deep sea fishing and caught a 40lb dophin fish and and a barracuda. What a blast.We went to the Saona Island trip but were were not over impressed. It took 7 hours to reach the island. We left the resort at 7am, had to pick up some people from a couple of other resorts. There seemed to be delays all they way getting there. We had to wait a good 陆 hour for people to get to our catamaran and the wind was against us going to it was a long boat ride. We reached Saona Island at 2pm. We only had 1 hour to stay on there to eat and swim. We felt too rushed. We spent all day traveling there. I would never do this trip again. A lot of money for a 7 hour trip to an island. Otherwise my granddaughter and husband really liked the starfish part of the trip (where you snorkel for starfish).I would recommend this resort to anyone! Just go and have fun you are on holidays!!!!!!!!! ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Resort! We booked our All inclusive trip with onlinetravelcenter.ca through Sunwing and had an amazing experience. We had read reviews of this resort prior to attending and weren't too sure what to expect. Well, here it goes. We arrived at the airport and were whisked to the hotel in a minivan with 2 other couples. Upon arriving at the lobby, we were greeted with a beautiful and tropical entranceway. Check in was very speedy. Although we had asked for an ocean view room, there are very few at this resort. We did get the king size bed we wanted. Our location was perfect for us. We were in the Villa Trinitarium, and just outside our villa was a bar and the pool and the mini golf. We were only one building away from the buffet and a few minutes from the beach. So for us, the location was great. Our room was spacious and perfectly fine for a 4 star resort. There were a few small ants in the bathroom, but no big deal. As for the mosquitos, we did not have any problems here. There were 4-6 mosquitos in our room each day, but coming from Northern Ontario, this was NOTHING. We never used (or needed) bug spray. Jhon (the bartender at the pool bar, not the swim up bar) was AMAZING and took great care of us. Kelvin at the beach bar was also a hoot. The concierge Jasson had a GREAT sense of humor and kept us laughing. We never attended any of the shows, as we were always pooped out by 10 p.m. The buffet was good and had a good variety, although it tends to be a bit repetivite each day. The oasta and omelets were my favorite. As a big dessert fan, I was slightly disappointed with the dessert tray. The fruit and juices were amazing though. And the meat is quite undercooked so you do have to ask for it to be very well done. We ate at the Dominican ala carte. It was a good experience. We did not eat at any other ala cartes, as we had read they weren't too impressive, but the buffet was enough to keep us satisifed. We never did find the 24 hour bar or 24 hour snacks. The beach bar closed up around 11 p.m. and the pool bar was closed by 6 p.m. The lobby was a great place to sit in the evenings for a few drinks and is only a 5 minute trolley ride away. The language barrier was aparent, but the staff did everything they could to accomodate and understand. Housekeeping in the rooms would occassionally forget to leave towels, but this was easily resolved with a quick phone call. The public bathrooms were our only complaint but as soon as we spoke with the concierge, there were cleaning people in them.The beach is gorgeuos and after walking to the market (turn left at the beach and walk 10 minutes) I thought our beach was better than the other 2 resorts on either side. The market was neat, but be prepared to barter, which my husband was not.We had high winds and big waves so a lot of the beach activities were cancelled, but that was mother nature's fault. People from London attended the Sauna Island tour and they were not very impressed. We were supposed to go snorkelling at the Marinarium, but this was cancelled (and refunded easily) due to the waves.Sunwing Rep Jean Luc was very helpful and made our stay very pleasant. So was his tour buddy Stacher.Attend the Sunwing briefing as it gives you a good idea of what to expect from the resort. All of the pictures that I have seen of the resort do not give it justice. It is a beautful place. The Caribe is actually the same resort with the same facilities, but people staying at the Caribe get more sit down ala cartes. The punta cana princess is abit more separate and it is an adults only place. There were quite a few topless women and speedoed men at the pool. The pool farthest to the left was our spot and it seemed quieter and less busy than the pool with the swim up bar and the other pool. Pools were always clean. Always staff cleaning up and gardening around the resort. Even cutting down coconuts and offering you a taste. The creperia was neat, serving banana splits and milkshakes, as well as all different kinds of crepes. We did not attend the Spa or the disco. The only really irritating thing was the people who try to get you to attend a hotel tour but after awhile they discover that you're not interested.If you get the chance to be photgraphed by the people walking around with monkeys, parrtos and snakes... DO IT. For $12 you get a beautful picture all photoshopped of extremely good quality. Very worth it. The boutiques are quite expensive and we ended up paying $4 for a package of MM's for our candy fix. Buy a phone calling card because te hotel charges you $2 per connection fee.All in all for the $$ we paid and for it being a 4 star resort, it was an excellent experience! ',GOOD,
'Beach great....that's it! The beach at the Tropical Princess was spectacular. We had no problems finding seating at either the beach or at one of the 3 well-maintained pools.Before I continue, I would like to prefice my future comments by noting that I do not have high expectations when travelling to countries such as the Dominican or Cuba (places of which i have had great holidays) and am well aware one should not have the same expectations of a 4 star there as in places such as Aruba, the Bahamas or Toronto for that matter.Unfortunately, I can't speak highly for either the food or the rooms. When arriving the rooms we occupied were both dirty and in disrepair - we actually fixed the toilet ourselves! The food was the worst I have ever had at a resort, and we're not picky eaters! Service was great when tips were given, otherwise, it took forever to get beverages! The 4 star ranking is certainly misleading. There are other resorts less expensive and far better! ',POOR,
'Great resort, though I would stay at the Club Caribe versus Tropical Princess We are a family of four (two girls aged 8  13) and have just back from spending March 6-13 at the Tropical Princess in Punta Cana.Check-in went rather smoothly though depending on the number of people ahead of you, it could take a long time due to the number of agents available and the speed of the check-in process. Lobby is nice and has a bar available.Grounds are fairly large compared to other resorts we have stayed at but is easily walkable. It鈥檚 not as large as the Bavaro Princess All Suites, but larger than other resorts we have stayed at in the past. If necessary, there are golf carts with attached 鈥渢railers鈥?with seating that follows the path between the lobby and pool area. Grounds are immaculate and well maintained with mangrove vegetation and various species of birds. Makes for an enjoyable stroll.The resort comprises of both the Caribe Club Princess and the Tropical Princess. I would not stay at the Tropical Princess. It is a two star at best 鈥?though it classifies itself as a four star. Rooms are very dated and depressing. Windows do not close fully so there were many mosquitoes in the room. We upgraded to the Caribe Club which merits its four star rating. The rooms here are spacious, clean, modern and airy 鈥?which is expected from a four star. There are three pools located throughout the resort area. These are well maintained and clean. As expected, they are not heated and rely on the sun. I hate cold water and felt comfortable swimming in the pools. The main pool has the swim up bar and is the location where most of the sports activities are held. The other two pools are much quieter and this is where we spent our time. The pool closest to the Tropical Princess side of the resort meanders around and has great landscaping. There are umbrellas throughout the pool area.The main buffet restaurant was good. Food was better than the last few times we were in Punta Cana. As to be expected, food is not overly spiced to keep it rather neutral for all taste buds but there is a very wide selection with each night having a particular theme (I.e. French, Italian, etc.). There was always some standards such as pasta, pizza, etc. for the less adventurous. Service was attentive (I.e. getting drinks, clearing plates, etc.) and staff were courteous and friendly. Though the last two days the resort did get busier and there were longer wait times to get in to the restaurant and to get drinks 鈥?no big deal.We tried the Italian a la carte restaurant. It was no different from the buffet restaurant, other than the fact they serve you. I wouldn鈥檛 do it again. There is also an Asian, Brazilian and fish restaurant available. My suspicion is that they would be similar in experience. This is an all inclusive resort so I do not expect gourmet dinners. I can wait until I get home for fine dining.Bar drinks typically use super sweet syrupy mixtures. The days of using fresh fruit to mix with those Caribbean type drinks are long gone to keep costs down. We resorted to drinking beer and water most of the time. Wines are plonk. Beaches are great 鈥?wide and long white sandy beaches. Lots of umbrellas available and we never had a problem finding one when we hit the beach at 10:30. Of course, the front row is taken by then. Water is a nice aqua colour and depending on the type of day, there are great waves to frolic in. Even on red flag days, my 8 year old daughter was jumping in the waves with no concerns.I would recommend this resort to others. You will not be disappointed. I would however avoid staying in the Tropical Princess itself and book the Club Caribe. ',GOOD,
'Friendly Staff, Great Beach, Average Hotel Rooms, Good Value My wife and I stayed at the Tropical Princess (1 night) and then were moved to the Carib Club Princess from March 4-11. The Tropical Princess and Carib Club Princess are basically the same resort. Tropical Princess guests stay in different housing on one side of the property but use the same facilities (pool, beach, bars,etc.). We paid for the VIP package which was worth it (includes premium drinks, free room service, 20 min. massage, 1 hr. motorized watersports and 1 hr internet pp). We were put in an average first floor double bed room upon arrival. Since we paid for VIP I expected a better room. I went back to the front desk, made a fuss and agreed to stay in that room for one night after the front desk personnnel said they couldn't move us that night. Supposedly all the rooms were reserved. That was BS since they were checking in large groups after we arrived and we were told when we booked our vaction that they didn't reserve rooms. Anyway, after much complaining the following day and wasting an hour at the front desk, we were upgraded to a room with a king size bed at the Carib Club on the top floor- MUCH better!. If you're used to fine hotels (I am) these rooms are not that way. I'd rate them 3 stars but they were clean and pretty miuch how they look in the hotel pictures. I wasn't paying top dollar so they more than met my expectation. The Bad :The front desk neglected to give us the VIP bracelets (which are orange by the way) when we checked in. After figuring that out, the VIP coincierge (different desk near the main desk) took care of us. Very few rooms face the ocean but most have nice views of pool, gardens, etc. Room repairs don't always happen the first or second time you ask (our TV remote control wasn't working well). Be patient, you're on DR time.Some of the food and fancy drinks are different from what you get in the States- nonetheless it's easy to find something to your liking cause they have so much food. Not everyone speaks English but many do. Not many Americans were there but plenty of Canadians were if you want to meet other English speaking folks. I read somewhere that when in your room, only use bottled water for brushing teeth, drinking, etc. All other places on the resort, the water is fine (alcoholic drinks with ice, plain water, salads, etc. ) We had no problems whatsoever with sickness. The good: I was pleasantly surprised with the food at the buffett. (don't miss the Creperie restaurant for lunch, by the way) The food at the restaurants (reservations required) was just OK (went to La Cava, Mexican and Dominican) so we decided to do the buffett for the wider selection and so we could go when we wanted to. Staff and service was excellent. Staff members went out of their way to say hola whenerver you passed them. The men employees love to shake your hand and earnestly want to get to know you. We tipped, but not excessively so they weren't just being nice because we gave them money. Sometimes the beach bars were a little crowded so I'd go back to the beach for 5-10 minutes and come back when fewer folks were waiting. They did seem to treat us differently when they saw the VIP bracelets. (I wasn't crazy about their house brand liquor although the Presidente beer was great- I'm picky that way.). The resort was very clean- even the beach bathrooms! We liked having the free room service for breakfast in the room (again, VIP package). So my advice to you is to request a room on an upper floor (fewer or no, mosquitos), and make sure you're happy before you settle in. Make sure you get a king size bed if that's what you want and politely argue with the front desk until you get the room you want.. After that, have a Presidente , slow down and you'll be happy. All in all it was a really good vacation. ',GOOD,
'Great Trip - Bad Service Great place to go if you would like to inhale the beauty of colours and sights. The walk from the hotel to the main building is a memory of its own. Wonderful sand and sun. The ocean was nice and inviting. Just like any trip this one had its own unpleasantries such as the service (seems as though this hotel has been running for a long time and the staff no longer care about the human nature of the service that they give, rather than financial. If you are a big tipper and spender perhaps you will enjoy the service as well. At this point I am not saying that we are bad tippers but leaving $5 for every drink that you take in an all-inclusive hotel is a bit harsh) and from the last time we have been there the food has gotten a little worse. For the past three days we had only had hamburgers, a lot of food is out at all times but very hard to choose something that not only looks great but also tastes as it looks. I am happy we went there and have seen the sights we've seen. Going there again... is not something we would consider. ',POOR,
'Great Beach, Poor Food The Tropical Princess is ascetically beautiful and complete with an amazing beach. The beach truly makes this resort! The grounds are well maintained and you very rarely ever see any garbage on the resort. It seems like the grounds keepers are always working on something from paint touch ups to pruning the trees throughout the resort. Four of us traveled to this resort and had a great time but we do have two complaints. The food is very poor at best and none of us are picky eaters! Also this resort is not geared towards an English speaking crowed. This is very apparent on the Tropical Princess side of the resort with the animation team. If you do speak English they will not give you the time of day. On the other side of the resort is the Carib Club Tropical Princess and their animation team was great! Again they cater to a Spanish or French crowed but they do make an effort. Because there are less English speaking patrons there are less people for you to interact with BUT on the bright side it pushed those of us who do speak English together and we found we met more people on this vacation then on other vacations. Overall this is a 3 star resort with an amazing beach. Remember to pack bug spray and Imodium. ',POOR,
'Everything was nice, great vacation-beware itravel2000.com price gaugers Spent a week at the Tropical Princess from Jan 12-19th. All food was great, did not need immodium or pepto all week. Rooms were plain but did not spend much time there. The food was great, the buffet had some of the same items each day but there was a theme each night and always a good variety. The beach was stunning and i had no complaints about the vacation.Tried to book online through Itravel2000 and they tried to charge me higher than their posted web price. was able to get a lower price from my local travel agent. ',GOOD,
'Great value Although this was our first time in Punta Cana, we have stayed at numerous all inclusives all over Mexico. Let me start off by saying that the Tropical princess and the Caribe club princess are one and the same resort using all the same facilities. If you are booked with the tropical princess you only have access to two a la carte restaurants, if you are booked with the Caribe princess you have access to more. There are 7 a la carte restaurants one buffet and a couple of snack bars. The grounds, lobby, pools, beach are all clean,attractive and well maintained. The buffet is quite good, plenty of variety, clean, and there always seemed to be plenty of clean tables available. But it IS still a buffet and at night we prefer to eat at a nice restaurant. This is where we were somewhat dissapointed. Our first a la carte, el Pilon, was attached to the back of the buffet and was truly dissapointing. We decided to pay extra and try Mamma mia the following night. Again we were very dissapointed in the food. Our third night we paid quite a bit more to have the lobster which we'd heard was very good, and it was. Our last night we tried the Brazilian restuarant included in our package and it was good. Enough about the food. The staff at the resort was excellent. Always friendly, always smiling and eager to help. Our room was ok, it was a room, spacious but the light fixture in the bathroom didn't work, they tried to fix it but after 3 days of showering in the dark we complained and were upgraded to a nicer room with a king size bed. We were quite happy about that. Still the bedding in both rooms was very worn and the sheets and mattress pads seemed too small for the beds and we woke up most mornings on a bare mattress. Kind of gross. One more problem was mosquitos. There were alot, everywhere at night as well as in our rooms. We tried to kill as many as possible but still woke up every morning with new bites. They do spray, we saw a truck driving around one evening at supper time that looked like it was on fire. It was spewing huge grey clouds of toxic fumes for the mosquitos right into the open lobby and beyond. Why they wouldn't wait to do this till everyone was sleeping is beyond me. We went on two tours. Saona island was a very nice day, very long but we really enjoyed it. Our other tour the country safari, again was very long, didn't enjoy it as much as it involved what seemed like hours and hours of driving between stops. The horseback riding on this tour was extremely lame (only young kids would enjoy it), we choose to skip it and waited in some sad looking hammocks in a rather shabby looking back yard. The majority of the other guests at the resort were french canadians, german, russian and french. We missed not being able to socialize with our fellow guests as we always have in Mexico. We've always made new friends on our vacation... this is the first time we didn't meet anyone. This all may sound a little negative but since this is a review I wanted to be as truthful as possible. All in all, considering what we paid I do feel we got good value for our money. We really enjoyed the lobster dinner, our massages, (they were awesome!) pizza by the pool, walking the beautiful beach, and the friendliness of the people. However we are going to return to Mexico for our next vacation, we feel the food is better and enjoy socializing with other english speaking guests. ',POOR,
'Loved this place We stayed at the Tropical Princess part of this resort from Dec 2-9, 2007. Cleanliness - We booked last minute and found a great deal so we were not expecting anything to fantastic. The rooms were very clean as was the resort itself, there were always chairs / loungers at the pool side and on the beach, and both were beautiful. Staff seemed to be cleaning throughout the day at various areas.Dining - The dining experience was good, Buffet food is well buffet food, lots of variety but never fantastc! There is a large variety of a la carte resturants, some you pay 8US$ for, which we never did get charged so Id say its worth checking them out. Nightlife / Entertainment - We are both in our late 20's and were looking for a week to lounge around an enjoy the hot weather.... which we did! We didnt look to hard to find night life but it did not seem to be a party all night long hotel by anymeans! The entertainment provided at the front theater was very comical, lots of laughs.Shopping - Bike into town to shop or you can walk along the beaches. The locals also come to the hotel throughout the week so you can shop right at the resort. Overall I would recomend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing week away. ',GOOD,
'Adored the princess I just returned From Punta Cana last night, it was the most amazing trip I have ever been on. The staff at the princess is incredible and so friendly. The food at the buffet was great, every night had a different theme. I pesonally was dissapointed with the food of the restaurants a la carte but the buffet made up for it. The bars were all really awesome (bartenders always singing and happy), the 24 hour beach bar was very convenient too! Apart from that the Beach was beautiful and very clean. I met some incredible people and i am definetly returning and would recommend this place to everyone needing some time to relax. ',GOOD,
'Tropical Storm Olga didn't spoil our Tropical Princess experience.       View from our 3rd floor balcony ',GOOD,
'Great Family resort       Surf ',GOOD,
'should be 5 star we thought this resort was excelent, this was our third time to punta cana and this resort was superior in many ways. the food was very good, we had a family suite witch was excelent. gardens were beautiful, entertainment was excelent. the resort was small enough to make it personal but large enough to make it superior. beach and pools were both very nice. one complaint were the drinks, they lacked flavor so they just added more rum. just a note if you speak english you are a minority at this resort, spanish and french are the main choices. but you can always find someone to translate for you. we will recomend and likily return to this resort. ',GOOD,
'What a great trip! Wow, what a vacation! Let me preface by saying I was a little concerned as I had read mixed reviews for this and other Punta Cana resorts鈥?our experience was great.I traveled with my 14 year old son, a father/son get away. We understood ahead of time that this was not a 5 star resort in New York, and that we would be experiencing a different culture, with different standards, and different attitude鈥?with this in mind we hoped for the best but tried not to set our sights so high that we would be disappointed. We were NOT disappointed.The resort is beautiful. The lobby open with a beautiful set in the lush gardens and ponds, with peacocks, ducks and other birds. The lobby bar was a great meeting place for the friends we made, ending each night with drinks and conversation before the 10pm live show in the theatre. (More on this later)The path from the lobby to the different room buildings was about 6 min brisk walk or 12 minutes to enjoy the sights which worth enjoying. We stayed in the Tropical Princess which is 4 identical buildings, 2 floors. We were on the top room, with a great view of the pool. Top floor rooms have stunning vaulted ceilings and we enjoyed the open feeling. The d茅cor was nice, stunning with the vaulted ceiling, but the furnishings were not special. The bathroom was large, although there were stains on the counters and tub鈥?when they paint they are not as careful as one would expect鈥?this is part of the different culture. Our room was always cleaned. No bugs, although one Gecko did find his way in on the third night. We caught him under a cup and released him out side.There are only small drawers, not big enough for cloths, I understand this is typical in all DR resorts. The water was always hot and lots of pressure. Our fridge was always stocked with pop and water. I let our maid know we did not want coke, only diet coke (called coke lite in DR). Even though she did not speak English, and we did not speak Spanish, we could easily communicate. We tipped her $3 US each day and a little gift and we understand this goes a long way to maintain good service.The staff at these resorts make as little as $150/month鈥?your tips go a long way. We tipped about $80 over the week and always had great service. Tip the first day, and try to go back to the same bartenders  waiters and you will always get great service. For the price we paid, adding $80 in tips was still a steal of a deal and makes a huge difference.The other resort that shares the same property is the Cribe Princess (my spelling is wrong), they have several buildings. Some are new and some are old. It is real hit and miss in the rooms here. Two groups of friends we met had to change rooms, others we met were not happy with theirs but did not change. Although Tropical Princess is the 鈥渓esser鈥?of the two resorts, the buildings are consistent and on average better then the Cribe Princess.The food was great. With 70 to 100 items at the buffet, if you can鈥檛 find a variety to make yourself happy, the problem is with you not the resort. Breakfast and lunch at the buffet were pretty similar and good. For breakfast let me recommend the fresh cressoints鈥?from the oven to my plate in 10 seconds. The omelettes were great, as was all the food I ate鈥?we are not adventurous and had mostly the common breakfast fare. Lunch was equally good, and if you don鈥檛 want to walk from the beach to the buffet, there are two beach eateries. These have chicken, chips, hamburgers, hot dogs nachos, cheese and such. The burgers and hot dogs did not look appetizing and I can have those at home so we never tried (did not hear good things about them.) The chicken was great.For dinner the are several al carte choices, only two were included in our Tropical Princess package. The DR restaurant was good, different but beautifully presented鈥?my son preferred the choices at the buffet. The food at the Brazil restaurant was outstanding, wow, great, get the picture. In the buffet each night there was a different theme. If you did not like the theme food, there were always lots of pasta, chicken, and safe North American style food. One foot note on food, the breads, buns, and potatoes were outstanding. I wish our potatoes tasted like they do in the DR, wow! The breads were all fresh, like hot out of the oven, and we really love good bread.One sour note, the red wine is not good, and the white wine is OK at best. All other drinks were great, love the beer and slushy drinks with or without alcohol. The beer is comparable to American beer.In the afternoon there is a Crepe restaurant that is great. The fruit creaps are just OK but the savoury ones are really good. The 3 pools were great. The one closest to the Tropical princess is mostly families and quiet. The middle one is also quit and the smallest鈥?not many people at this pool. The third and farthest pool is the party pool with the swim up bar and activities. This is where we played when we choose the pool. Now speaking of the activities, they were great. The staff speak a bit of English and they give it their best shot. Freddie we miss you! These guys are a ton of fun and put up with us throwing them in the pool and all our pranks. They appreciate tips and your good nature. We enjoyed pool volleyball, beach volleyball, ping pong, darts, and pool exercise classes. Age 12 to 60 in all these activities the week we were there. We were glad to walk to the far pool for the activities, and glad our room was far away for when we wanted a break from the noise. Our friends who moved were near the pool and hated the noise at the beach bar till late late in the evening. Not a problem at the Tropical Princess.The beach is amazing. Almost white sand, clean, beautiful blue water, few weeds and debris in the water, but the surf is active. This is great for adults and older kids riding boogie boards and playing in the surf鈥?but a little much for younger kids, say under 8. There were tons of lounges and shade canopies. Tons more then the other resorts we walked by. The resort was 98% full and we always found a spot at 9 鈥?11. If we got up earlier, we could have had the front row of loungers (they were 5 to 8 rows deep.)We took bug spray, never used it. We took meds for tummy troubles, used a bit on the 5th day for travelers diarea for me, but nothing serious. My son ate more salad then I and he was great the whole time. All the water used in cooking is filtered bottled water. The nightly entertainment was always enjoyable鈥?but much of it is in Spanish, French, and sometimes German. Some nights it is all dancing and lip syncing to English songs. We saw 6 shows and enjoyed them all, but some better then others. No Lion King or Michael Jackson shows the week we were there鈥?too bad we were looking forward to these. Sunwing was great for us. Flight on time, the rep at the hotel was great鈥?the only complaint is that we did not get free ear phones on the plane as promoted. Yes there were minor irritants at times, not all staff is as good as they could be but most are great. Things are different here then at home. If you love it so much at home, why are you taking a trip to a different culture? The locals are friendly and appreciate when you try to communicate in Spanish. I only knew a dozen words but they appreciate my effort and body language is universal.Will we go back, you bet鈥?looking forward to next fall, and yes I am going back to the same resort, it was great.I hope this helps, we appreciated the reviews from others. Have a great trip! ',GOOD,
'Tropical Princess Okay... Sun Wing Vacations Not So Good The beach at the Tropical Princess in Punta Cana was lovely, best part of the holiday. The resort, could be improved. The rooms were in need of improvement. The food our group thought was okay until about the fourth day of our holiday. 3 of the 4 in our group were ill from the food/drink. One of the group was very ill, needed medical attention. The doctor at the resort was very good. The worst part of the holiday was SunWing Vacation, the company we booked our holiday with. They have some customer service problems that need to be improved. We were 12 hours delayed leaving the Toronto airport. I would not recommend booking with SunWing!Otherwise, the holiday was very relaxing and enjoyable. ',POOR,
'Fantastic Beach, Good but not Outstanding Resort Our family of four just returned from an all-inclusive one-weeker at the Tropical Princess. Weather was great throughout. Our only other all-inclusive experience was at the Riu Mambo/Merengue/Bachata complex in Puerto Plata last year, so that is the only basis of comparison we have.Point form summary:Beach - Absolutely wonderful. Very fine, nearly white sand; turquoise water, very clear except nearest the shore where waves were crashing. Smooth sandy weed-free bottom all the way out to the end of the enclosed swimming area. (Puerto Plata beaches DO NOT compare!) Be sure you like big surf, though (my 9- and 11-y.o. girls loved it) - it's too rough for younger children.Pools - Very well maintained, but we all much preferred the ocean!Resort grounds, architecture and layout - The buildings are very nice, colourful, photogenic, with rustic-looking thatched roofs; grounds are well-tended; the path from the lobby to the hotel buildings winds through a protected mangrove swamp - which sounds unattractive, but it was interesting to look at and it was not at all buggy.Room - Ours was quite large by our own modest standards, with a cathedral ceiling and a good sized bath. Quite clean, no problems with bugs, etc., although the sink trap leaked a bit (and it was not fixed during the course of the week despite notifying management).Service - We wished staff were friendlier, more attentive and had better English-seaking abilities. (The Riu was vastly better on all these counts). Service was not abysmal by any means but it tended to be slow and perfunctorily delivered.Food - Not as good as we experienced at the Riu complex in Puerto Plata, but the variety made it possible to find something half decent every day. One disappointment was the absence of a good, simple grilled fish (which we enjoyed daily at the Riu) as the Tropical Princess seems to lean heavily on the deep-fried, batter-coated and sauce- and gravy-slathered, which is not to our taste. Strikes me that the hotel was attempting to North Americanize the food but not quite hitting the mark - wish they'd stick to fresh local fare prepared simply and well.We had no gastrointestinal problems (and we ate lots of salad every day).On the drinks front, we can assure you that they do not water the alcohol in the mixed drinks (as we were convinced the Riu was doing when we were there)!Hotel guests - This place is definitely popular with non-English speakers (French, Russian, Spanish, German and Italian primarily) - thus there were relatively few opportunities for social interaction with other guests. (I suspect the Spanish and French speakers are treated better by the staff.)Excursions - We did parasailing, a snorkelling excursion (swim with the sharks) and scuba. All were excellent; we were particularly pleased with the service provided by the on-site scuba shack, run by some young Germans who were very attentive with our daughters (who were doing their first ocean dives).Nightlife and spa - We were too busy doing other things or too tired at the end of the day to experience these.Overall, we had a very good time, but will probably try somewhere else - with more English-speaking staff and guests - next year. A tune-up on the food front and some better staff training would make it an outstanding resort. ',GOOD,
'Forget the bad reviews...........Fantastic Hotel!!!!!!! I have just come back from a fantastic two week holiday at The Tropical Princess in Punta Cana  really felt I had to write a review to share just how fab I thought this hotel was!!!!!!!!Prior to departing we had been reading all the reviews here on Trip advisor  were quite worried when most of them were bad!!!!! To say we were worried was an understatement.... reading stories of, bad food, bad service, poor rooms, theft  food poisoning! After my holiday I really don't know where those reviews came from..................maybe it's just a brit thing.....how we love to complain.......were some made up?????On arriving at the hotel we were met at reception by a very friendly receptionist who was very helpful with all our checkin procedures, they seemed really keen to help  answered all questions we had there  then...............even though there was a large queue of people waiting to check in!!!!!!!! When we reached our rooms we were really pleasantly suprised by the standard..........the rooms were bright, spacious  really clean we were over the moon!!!!! Yes the curtains  bed spread may have been a little gaudy but hey we are staying in the Dominican Republic  not some swanky hotel in the west end of london.........................the tastes are totally different!!!!!!! We also had a mini bar that was stocked with soft drinks  was refilled every day when the maids cleaned our rooms.....which i must add was done to a high standard!The one area we were really scared about was the food so you can imagine how chuffed we were when we saw how great the food was...................Grilled Lobster on your all inclusive.......who could ask for more!!!!! The food was varied  there was something to suit all tastes. The menu changed every day of our 2 week stay so it didn't feel samey at all! I was very impressed  coming from a family of chefs  resturantaurs that says alot!!!!!!! The food of course had a lot of Foreign flavours but then hey we are in the Dominican Republic it's not going to be British food.........I really cannot understand the previous bad reviews about this .................................perhaps it was because they didn't serve the heart attack egg  chips type meals we brits so love???? There was fresh fruit available all day inthe resturant which was lovely.........mmm mmm the passion fruits!!!! Neither myself or my partner suffered from a deli belly the whole holiday maybe thats because we were not scared to ask the (friendly) chefs to cook the grill food to our liking! The service in the resturant was also very good the staff were friendly  always there when you needed them.......you never had to wait for anything. They didn't speak much english but they knew all the important words so you could get by  anyway who am i to say anything.........I was in a spanish speaking country so didn't expect them to speak fluent english!The pools were lovely  well maintained the main pool was quite noisey due to the entertainers but if that wasn't for you then there was also a quieter pool that you could use  the beach was absolutely stunning!!!!!! The watersports facilities were great  they certainly gave you variey of things to do! The entertainers were good at their jobs  kept everyone busy with activities......although I myself didn't join in they were always friendly  smiley.Security at the resort was brilliant ......we had no problems ...but then we hired a safe to make sure nothing could happen!!!!!Overall this was by far the best holiday I have ever had ..............and this is one of the best hotels I have been in....... i'm an ex-holiday rep so I been in a fair few. This is not the ritz but then it's not a 5 star hotel  it doesn't claim to be. It's not the most expensive hotel in the world to stay in so I think for what you pay you certainly get more than your monies worth!!!!!! I would definitely go back. Please do not let all the bad reports put you off this hotel...............................It Absolutely Fabulous!!!!!!!! ',GOOD,

'A great holiday I have to say reading everyone else's reviews before I went was not a good idea, as they were all so negative before I went away. I went there very worried. I came back thinking it was fine, the resort is fine! All worried for no reason.Firstly I have decided to review this resort and counter some of the bad reviews the place has had recently. So please read the last few reviews to understand.1. The food.Was fine! There was variety, and different themes each night, and I would recommend you try the themed food as that is the freshest and nicest! I managed to have a different meal each day, lunch and dinner, and not once did I get a tummy complaint (and I suffer from IBS!). Note: If you get an undercooked bit of meat - ask them to cook it better - its not hard to do - 'Bien Hecho' means well done. Although I have to say I didn鈥檛 see any 'pink' meat.I think what also helped is we didn鈥檛 restrict ourselves to the resort either, although on AI deal, we went to a fab fish restaurant called Jellyfish (amazing!!), and also the Hard Rock. We made the holiday work for us not the other way around.The ala carte restaurants. Don鈥檛 think you should bother. The Mexican isn鈥檛 that good but they are nice in there. The Creperie during the day was lovely.2. BeachWas amazing. And I would recommend if you want a chilled holiday - namely couples 鈥?with no kids or little kids 鈥?go in mid September. We always got a lounger on the beach (no matter what time i.e no need to get up at 6.30am!) 鈥?in fact it was deserted most the time and very quiet and yet the weather was fab (even better was the rain tended to fall in the middle of the night and only happened a couple of times therefore not even noticeable).3. Pools.Didn鈥檛 actually go in them because the beach was so fab, but the pools were always being used so can鈥檛 have been that bad or dirty!4. Rooms.Fine fine fine!! Mini bar 鈥?free! Rooms huge. All in all fab. Cleaners did a fab job. No roaches, pests, great Air Con. Fine fine fine!5. Sellers.Yes there are some a couple of nights a week outside the restaurant and on beach they would walk by. But to be honest they really didn鈥檛 pester us that much, if at all. It鈥檚 not a problem.6.Reception.Checkin and checkout was easy and not slow. The girls on reception not smiley but the guys were and to be honest 鈥?do I really care of one girl on reception doesn鈥檛 smile at me? Not really.7. Saftey.Well I was never worried, and it wasn鈥檛 a problem.Maybe because I had read everyone else鈥檚 reviews I was extra safe. I always carried my safe key with me and never left anything out on the bed or anywhere in the room. I never gave them an opportunity to steal. All in all, this was a good holiday. It is not the best holiday resort ever, but I knew that from the start 鈥?I paid very little for this holiday, and therefore I got exactly what I was expecting. A nice resort, with nice friendly staff, nice food, nice drink and nice all round. If you want a better holiday then pay thousands for it and you will get it. You get what you pay for and I got a lovely holiday. ',GOOD,

'Last Resort! We have been very fortunate to have travelled to many countries and stayed in a variety of hotels and this is certainly far from our best experience.The main objective of this trip was to relax in tropical surroundings, sip nice cocktails, chill and do nothing!The Positives- The Beach is abolutely beautiful, far nicer than what I experience in the North of the Country.- The ocean was fantastic, bath warm and no rocks / stones. Only slight drawback was that it got a little choppy near the shoreThe Negatives- The service. I made an official complaint regarding the service which we received. The standard of english spoken at this resort is very poor, however a smile is a universal language! Not here! I was made to feel on several occasions when asking for something (especially a drink at one of the bars) that they were doing me a huge favour! The hotel is definately aimed at non-English speaking travellers.- The Pool. The two pools at the resort are quite large. They did attempt to clean the pools everyday, but its more than a one man job and takes longer than 30 minutes. The pools weren't disgusting, but there was a lot of debris from the surrounding trees.- The Food  Drink. This is not our first AI holiday, but it was th first that we wanted to skip meals throughout the day. The selection is fairly limited (especially if you want to avoid the riskier items like uncooked meats and shellfish). The pasta station was safe, but after two days was getting tiresome.- The rooms. The rooms are reasonably clean and the beds are OK, but the decor is tired and the cleaners could be better (I reaslise that they earn next to nothing, but how hard is it to wipe dead flies off walls and windows).Overall, the location is very good and neighbouring hotels looked nice. If you've booked here, try and get moved! ',POOR,
'Don't visit !!!! Although the grounds and beach are very nice, the complex has to be avoided.We have just come back from 2 weeks at the Tropical Princess.The first day we got there we stayed by the pool and beach. On the evening my girlfriend wanted to dry off her bikini. We were on the ground floor and hung it on one of the chairs on the balcony. The next morning it was gone, stolen.We also had several roaches a night in our bathroom. I lost count of how many of the buggers I flushed down the toilet. The other people we met were all in 1st, or 2nd floor rooms and didn't have this problem. Maybe it's only GF or room 1114.Now to my real gripe .... FOOD :Firstly, I'm not the stereotypical British tourist who needs fish and chips, pie and chips and burgers constantly. However ... I expect my meat to be cooked through. And hygiene rules to be followed.We had chicken pink in the middle, pork again pink. When you decided enough was enough and got a burger ... yep, red raw in the middle.Myself and my girlfriend had chicken tortilla wraps one night, the next morning we were glued to the toilet. Not just us, from asking other people in the resort we have it that at least another 6 had the same problem. The hygiene standards are disgusting... food left out for far too long in the sweaty fly and bird infested restaurants, spoon used to whisk raw eggs and then left in the ham / cheese. When we told out Thomson rep about the food poisoning he said Yeah it takes a bit of getting used to What a joke!!!The hotel also invites market sellers into the complex twice a week. They setup directly outside all the entrances to the food hall, meaning you have no choice but the walk past them. They badger you constantly. Very annoying.If you do visit Punta Cana, learn to get very ignorant to the sellers. Its the only way to take a walk down the beach.The holiday is over now, but my stomach is still in pieces.THANKS A LOT TROPICAL PRINCESS CHEFS ',POOR,
'Friendly place with some bad design and great beach ! This place is slow on check in, but the guys are so kind i didnt mind at all, i was there with my 13year old daugther. Better book a superior room, nicer areas, because the rest lacks on the design, not warm. The personnel is very courtois and do their best, the big flaw of this resort is the housekeeping, it was a problem for everyone in the regular rooms. Food was ok, found something good at each meal and the drinks too. Great service from bartenders and servers in the restaurants, dont miss the mexican restaurant, its fun tequila at your table ! The animators are very kind and try their best, but nightlife is inexistant on the resort, youll need to go out and they plan fun stuff to do for about 25$ per person. Somes discos are worth seing. Beach is the best part, take a catamaran tou its worth it, great staff there also.For any medical need there is a drug store with a nice pharmacist that will help you. Room are descent, if you go there in summer, pick a room on the second floor, its cooler. First floor rooms were smelly apperently from people who change room.We were on third and i was fine. The main pool, where the bar is, wasnt always clear and some people got ears infection during my trip. But we had a nice and relaxing week, we met wonderful people, from usa, france, haiti !!! Beach is perfect you can take long walks... ',POOR,
'Fantastic Hotel!       Shops ',GOOD,
'Service was excellent I just got back from the Tropical Princess in Punta Cana and we had a blast. Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers stated, the workers were extremely friendly and helpful. If you tipped them or knew a little Spanish, you were treated like kings. The resort was filled to capacity, and I think we were the only people from the US. Most of the other tourists were from Italy, Germany, France, or Russia and spoke little or no English. I also noticed that the Europeans never or hardly ever tip. I'm not sure if that is a cultural thing or if that they are just outright cheap. Make sure you give a dollar or two for every drink or meal. You'll make a lot of good friends fast and you'll get excellent service. The resort grounds were beautiful. Workers were outside all day combing the grounds for any imperfections. The only thing I didn't like was a smell that resembled sewage a few tropical trees gave off. These trees had what looked like berries hanging from them so we called them Poopberry Trees. Most of the tourists are families or couples so it isn't the best place for singles. I went with one friend and we are both single, but we still ended up having a great time. We met a few good looking Italian women who didn't speak English so nothing became of that. The club Arieto on the grounds was a good time, but not the best club for singles, unless you want to pay for a night with a Dominican woman. Dominican women are exceptionally gorgeous. They would come up and flirt with you a lot, but would then tell you how much they cost. I wasn't really into that. I went off of the resort into the inner Dominican and found everyone to be friendly. I didn't run into any problems. If you rent a car, don't let your Dominican friend borrow it because he will probably total it. It was interesting riding the cabs located right off the resort. These were composed of dirt bikes where my friend and I would climb on the back. We both average around 220 pounds so picture three people on one of these little dirt bikes weaving in and out of traffic. One time, the driver couldn't make a turn and we crashed right into a car waiting at a stop sign. He was not too happy with the dents in the side of his car and his broken mirror. We fled that scene quickly. The Mamajuana is a different kind of liquor and I haven't seen it in the US. Ask to try some at one of the bars. Don't drink too much during the day. The combination of alcohol and the hot sun will wear you out fast. Ask for Hansel at the Brazilian restaurant and tell him Mike and Tim sent you. He'll take care of you. Make sure you get the VIP package (it was very well worth it). Don't order any drinks with ice in them. I was very sick for a day because of this. We at El Pescador one night and the dinner was awesome. The buffet didn't have a huge variety, but the fresh fruit and pastries made up for it. The pizza was very good there. Make sure you give some beers to the workers throughout the day. They will appreciate it very much. We were there for Hurricane Dean for a day, which was an interesting experience to be part of. The crepes and gelato at La Creperie were awesome. The pools were beautiful. They closed at 7pm, but no one monitored them to see if you went in after that. The spa and workout facilities were impressive for a resort. I recommend getting a massage, but not if you're sunburned. Also, I don't recommend you try driving a car you rent down the sidewalks of the resort. Security doesn't find it as funny as you may think it is. Overall, we had a fabulous time. I can only imagine that the people who would write negative reviews are whiny, expect everyone to speak English, and are too cheap to tip. Let me know if anyone needs any info. ',GOOD,
'Paradise still exists       Our accomodation ',GOOD,
'Love grounds everthing else terrible Don't even know where to begin from,starting from check in not friendly at all. The room was poor it had i desk with two drawers for four people to live for two weeks. Had to put towels under door for ants not coming into room. Food was very poor not much of selection.Kids eat pizza and fries for two weeks,constantly ran out of plates had to wait to get food,if you were looking for example mango they said none left.Bars very very poor asked for tropical drink would not now had to make it.Beer was the only safe thing to ask for and still would run out of beer and you would have to go to another bar.Beach towels ran out of clean ones every day sometimes had to use same one for two days, when you ask to replace they said come back half hour go back and they reply to late come back later.The only good thing about this resort was the grounds and beach and thank god weather was perfect. ',POOR,
'Loved the pizza I would recommend the tropical princess to anyone, but I wouldn't recommend the VIP package unless they have to money to chuck away and like spending loads of time looking at the customer services rep in the lobby.I spent hours there !! My spanish skills sure did improve listening to them for hours on end speaking on the phone whilst I sat waiting for attention. VIP is an acronym for Very Important Person. I felt like the opposite, so did my partner when we were ignored in the a la carte resteraunt - la cava. We upped and left soon after the waitress was too busy sorting out other peoples woes instead of taking our order. Enough moaning, the place was beautiful, a real tropical haven we didn't leave the resort all week. The food was plentiful and they cooked real omelettes for you in the morning. The beach was blissful and the sea sublime. It felt cold when you jumped in but it soon warmed up with the waves. Played water polo in the Caribe pool. Scored a couple of goals but let in a few when I was keeper. Pool bar was ace ! Swim up for a coke and rum how good is that ? Seen a wedding there too. Fancy horses and all. Definantly go back.

'Lovely hols - with a few bumps along the way! My boyfriend (24) and I (21) have returned from our 2 weeks hols in the Dominican Republic. We stayed at the Tropical Princess with Thomson.1) The flight: One of the best I've been on. Thomson have upgraded all of their long haul aircrafts. For 拢5 each you could upgrade the television in the back of your seat. There was a fab selection of movies (e.g. Wild Hogs, Disturbia, Blades of Glory), over 90 upto date CD albums that you could create a playlist from of over 50 songs, radio, games and lots of fun stuff for kids. The seats have an extra 3 leg room to and it's amazing at the difference it makes.2) Arrival in the DR: On arrival you are greeted by latin music and you have your photo taken (which you buy on your departure). We were quickly taken through the airport and onto the coach after greeting our Tour Rep Louise (who was lovely). The transfer from the airport is under 1 hour and we arrived at the Tropical Princess at around 4.30pm DR time.3) Check-in: Was pretty straight forward, you were given your room key, towel keys and you paid approx. $30 for a safe key. The porters take you and your luggage on the small shuttle buses to your room which is much welcomed after the long flight!4) Room: We were lucky to have a room in one of the villas. Gardenia villa - which my boyfriend was a little disappointed with but it did the job for somewhere to sleep and shower. It had a large wardrobe and quite alot of drawer space. A very large bed and balcony. The mini fridge was stacked daily and our maid was lovely. If you leave a few dollars here and there they will always leave clean towels which we had changed everyday. We had lovely surprises such as flowers and swans (towels) left for us.5) Food/ Buffet: There a variety of specialist restaurants: Chinese, Italian, Seafood, Dominican and Brazilian which are at a supplement of $8pp. The main buffet area which is free Higueros was lovely, I mainly stuck to pasta, which was the best and most popular staple food over there from the queues! My boyfriend enjoyed the pizza (also amazing), chips, burgers and hotdogs! We visited the Chinese in our first week which was quite disappointing, everything was soaked in soy sauce. We also visited the Italian but for what you get you might as well eat in the buffet restaurant and save yourselves $8pp. I was not sick during the holiday but my boyfriend had a bad stomach due to a seafood dish he ate one night, so I would be wary of seafood!!The waiter/waitress service was hit and miss, no matter how many tips you left! One day would be excellent and the next we didn't receive our drinks and waited 20mins to have our table laid- I think this is due to them being very busy - usually between 7.30pm and 9pm!6)Beach/Pool: What can I say the beach is amazing, white sands and crystal blue waters! There was a lot of seaweed but we didn't mind. The beach is also very busy, ONE WARNING - if you do not get up by 6.30am to put towels down, you will not get any beds with an umberella - anywhere!! We were up every morning to reserve our beds, which signs tell you not too, but when everyone else is doing it - it's worth it! There a number of pools which are kept very clean, we had one right outside our villa!7) Entertainment: The entertainment is a little disappointing - mostly catered for Italians, Spanish and French. 10% of the music I heard was in English, but most of the time a guy was shouting on a microphone in Spanish!There were a few good shows we went to see at the large theatre near reception - Play Back is a must see - a little like X Factor. And the Lion King was brilliant! WARNING - wear lots of mosquito repelent - I was eaten alive - I had 24 bites after that one night! It was agony!8) The hotel itself: The complex is large - and is shared with the Caribe Club Princess. When we booked our holiday the only difference between the two hotels is that with the Caribe the specialist restaurants are free and the massive 拢200pp extra to stay at the Caribe! If i was considering the Caribe I would most definately choose the Tropical to save some 拢拢拢!The grounds were huge and there is a regular shuttle bus service to get you around, however we enjoyed walking as the scenery and wildlife was beautiful. The hotels rest on large mangroves, with wild peacocks, chickens, roosters, moorhens and ducks roaming around. There are large fish in the small pools too. People would take bread buns from the buffet restaurant and feed them.9) Our major problem: The only major problem we had during the holiday was to do with our safe key. Each safe has literally a lock and key which cost us $30 to purchase on check-in. There is no master key so if it is lost you must pay $45 to replace it. One afternoon we came back from the beach before going to the snack bar for dinner. My boyfriend kept the key in a sock in the drawer next to the bed (original and silly I know but I did warn him-men eh?!) instantly he knew the socks had been moved and then found that the key was missing. We searched the room from top to bottom and there was no sign. He was sure he had put it there that morning before breakfast. The only other person who had been in the room was the maid. I phoned reception immediately who said I should go to reception. I walked there on my own as my boyfriend wanted to stay to make sure no one came in (even though at this point we did not know whether the safe was empty or full). The guy behind reception kept repeating that if I lost it I must pay the $40 for a new one. I refused as I knew we had not lost it and that it had been taken. He asked me to go back to the room and he would send an engineer to break open the safe...3 hours, 2 men and one pneumatic drill later the safe was finally opened - to our relief everything was still there! During the time the men were in the room, we stayed, at one point the maid came in and my boyfriend saw her try to give the engineer the key but he shook his head and said it was too late. At this point we saw her hanging around the bathroom before leaving. Once the lock was off I went back to reception to get another lock and key! They still refused to give me one until I paid until I blew up and he agreed out of sheer fear I think. We gained another key and learnt from the experience to take the key everywhere we went! The next day, I found the key hidden in a magazine in the bathroom which I believe the maid put there when she came to see the engineer. We never saw that maid again but our new one was lovely. To be honest I am not sure that the maids intention was to take the safe key for our valuables (as they were still there). Our suspicions are that the hotel may orcastrate this to earn an extra few $$$!10) We did two of the Thomson experiences 1) Speed adventure and 2) Swimming with sharks and rays. The speed adventure was amazing, like James Bond and the people who organised it were really friendly! The sharks and rays was also very good, but I was a little scared of the Nurse sharks!11) We also used the spa on one of the wet days - of which there was only 2 - the rest of the time was boiling hot 30 dgrees! We both had an anti-stress massage which was lovely, and well worth the money - $70 for us both for 1/2 an hour.12) Overall the experience was lovely and the people are really friendly. It also helps if you try to speak a little Spanish, I did and it did us a few favours with the staff and service. My boyfriend found a new buddy - Hansel at the snack bar - he was really nice. Also there was an annoying yet compelling song that played constantly over the complex - Estan dificile! (If anyone knows who sings this please let me know!)I hope this review has been helpful, if you have any queries I have opted to be contacted regarding my experience so feel free to drop me an email.

'Great B-day celebration My sister and I just returned from a 4 day 3 night stay at the resort and I must say that we enjoyed every minute of our stay. I was celebrating my 50 th b-day and was looking for a place to relax and sit back. The resort caters to all types of people: adults, children, adolescents, etc. Check-in and check-out was so simple with no complications whatsoever. There are activities for all age groups. The rooms were impecably clean and neat. Our key did not open the door initially but when reported was solved quickly. On night the AC unit was not cooling properly. When reported the problem was solved in less than one half hour. Food was excellent but my sister had a slight upset stomach, but this was do to her over eating. The biggest assest the resort has are its people. Coming from an Island in the Carribbean (Puerto Rico) where we are used to happy and free spirited people, the dominicans are truly friendly and respectful. I honestly believe they enjoy what they are doing and most of all, are very aware of proper customer service. We tipped them generously but I was saddened by the fact they were not tipped as they should have been by other tourists. Most of them work double shifts and after conversations with some of the employees, we found our that they work 11 days in a row for a very, very low salary. Nevertheless, I would return in a blink of an eye. Great B-day celebration. ',GOOD,
'"Loved the Dominican but not this hotel!" Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a 2 week holiday staying at the Tropical Princess Hotel. I have to say after reading such fantastic reviews i was expecting a lot more than we got.1) Check in at the hotel was fine although for a 4* hotel i would have expected a safe to be included in the room. When we reached our room the key given to us did not work and we had to wait 30mins before we could gain access.2) In the room we had no hairdryer, couldn't use the clothes draws as the fridge was in front of them and the doors on the wardrobe were boken (which my boyfriend had to fix!). We complained to reception twice to get a hairdryer and when that didn't work our rep complained for us. We then saw a member of staff take a hairdryer from another room which she then gave to us!3) The maid service at this hotel definately needs some attention. We very rarely had fresh towels delivered everyday and when we did get some it would be between 6-7pm. I thought that this was too late in the day as after spending the day on the beach all i wanted to do was get showered and clean! 4) On one particular day me and boyfriend were on an excursion and the maid had smashed a bottle of coke on our bedroom floor. When we returned we were disgusted to find our floor covered in splinters of glass that hadn't been cleared up properly which led to my boyfriend cutting his feet twice. After this incident we were so disgraced that we had to complain. On complaining we were assured that somebody would come and clear the rest of the glass up but did this happen no! we had to ring again the following day to get somebody to sweep the rest up.5) During our stay my boyfriend got sick twice and i got sick once. I have travelled to many places such as africa, thailand and i have even been to the dominican before and i have never been sick on holiday. We only had bottled water, even for brushing our teeth and never ate the salad or anything that could have been washed in their water! I can only guess that it was the food but i won't be going back to find out!6) i've been to the dominican before and stayed in a 3* hotel and found all the staff lovely. However although some members of staff here were friendly and helpful i found many of them rude and had such a poor attitude towards service. It almost felt like they had your money and therefore couldn't be bothered to make an effort, definately not 4* service! Maybe the complex is just to large to provide such a high standard to everbody.Although me and my boyfriend complained nothing really changed and in the end we gave up and tried to enjoy the holiday. I for one didn't want to spend the whole time complaining! That is why i have left it for now!I have to say on a positive note that the grounds were lovely and the beach and pools were also georgeous. You do have the problem of getting a bed by the pool or on the beach as there is definately not enough for everybody so be prepared for an early rise.Entertainment is only really catered for to the italians which is a shame,unless you understand italian you can't really join in. We never went to the evening entertainment so can't comment on that. We just enjoyed having cocktails in the bar!!The majority of people in the hotel were french, italian and german with some american and spanish. Although English people were around we were far and few between and so you would sometimes feel a bit segregated.Although we got sick the food was lovely and there was loads to chose from. We went to the chinese which was nice and made a change, although we did have to pay a bit extra for this.Me and my boyfriend went on 3 trips 1)monster truck 2)Saona Island 3)Speed venture where you get to drive your own speedboat. All the trips were excellent and without fault. The guides were brilliant and the places you visit are lovely so i would definately recommend these.Overall this hotel could be fantastic but we just had too many problems and felt the attitude of the staff and the service we received was extremely poor. I'Ve stayed in 2* places and got a better service than here.The domincan is lovely and the beaches were georgeous but this doesnt make up for the hotel which is where you will spend the most of your time! Unless this hotel improves i would not go back or recommend it to anybody! ',POOR,
'Fantastic place but only if you are italian or french have just returned home to uk, hotel good except you need to be italian or french to enjoy most of the facilitys,it is a great pity uk tour operaters can not provide brit's with the same type of quality entertainment and kid's club's as do the italian and french tour operaters. the jym is crap, broken machines, no heavy weights and air conditioning [--]. Oh yes i also advise you to take your own spoons ',GOOD,
'Second FAMILY Vacation We went on vacation during the week of June 23 till the 30th. Our flight was from Toronto, Canada with SUNWING and we booked with HOLIDAY MARKET TRAVEL (Grace). Both of which gave us excellent customer service.  We had a long bus ride into the hotel as Tropical Princess/Caribe Club Princess was the last stop but still manageable. We arrived at the hotel and had a not so good reception, as we travelled with a group of 4 couples and had requested all the rooms at least close together. Well, we got three together and the other couple was on the another floor and on the other side of the resort. . We did not appreciated that much...well, we had that changed but waited almost 48hours to get someone to change the rooms. The rooms need a bit of TLC but all in all the beds were very comfortable and house keeping was great (THANKS SONIA !!) . Although that was pretty much the only major speedbump on our trip.  Once all settled in, we all had a great time. The El Hingo Buffet restaurant was awesome. GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE. Breakfest was awesome. We tried the Dominican Restaurant too and I like that also but, not too much of a menu to choice from thou. All in all the food was great and everynight they had a different menu to choose from. Although another minor speedbump was that a few people in our groups got sick on the third day but, we can't determine that it was the food as the other were fine. The beach is beautiful, white sand, crsytal blue water ..... .AMAZING !!! Although another minor speedbump is the lack of beach chairs  beach towels. You really have to wake up early to get a decent place to be at the beach and towels are only available after a certain time. The animation group was OK...they did alot of games at the main pool area. The evening show were AMAZING TOO !!! We caught the festival show and the LION KING show both were great to watch...the LION KING show get 5 stars *****. Our check-out ran smoothly although a bit early but that was cause of our flight out. Our flight back was great we actually got back into Toronto 40mins early...GREAT FLIGHT SUNWING !!!! We will probably go back to Punta Cana but mostly likely check out the other hotels on the strip as I like to see new things. But as an OVERALL rating on the Tropical Club/Caribe Club Princess I give the hotel 3.5 stars. ',POOR,
'Fantastic... Just returned fom a fantastic week here. All the staff are really friendly and it caters for all ages. The hotel is 1 of 3 on the complex however no where was over crowded and lots of free sunbeds available either at 1 of the 3 pools or on the beach. Each pool caters for the individual ranging form a quiet pool area to the party pool which is fab for all ages if you want to have a good laugh and burn off some of those pounds from all the inclusive food and drink:-) It is a very mixed hotel with people from all over the world, we have made some wonderful friends and everyone holidaying here seemed really chilled out and friendly. The beach here is amazing pure white sand and turquoise sea, you can get trips here right on beach too, we went on a snorkelling trip for just $20 for adults and $10 for kids. I did get sick on my last few days here however I did not let this ruin my holiday and I am not going to blame anything I ate or drank for my illness as I dont know if I had a bug or something?! I would definatley go back here and wished I had booked for 2 weeks now. ',GOOD,
'Great for all! Our group of 13 stayed at the Tropical Princess for a week in April. We had real variety in our group: Family with 2 children under 4, 2 sets of Grandparents with various health issues, very active Aunt  Uncle plus 3 X 30 something singles. We all had a great time. There was something for everyone. The buffet was great. We only went to one ala carte as the buffet was better and no waiting for food to arrive. Entertainment was good, including the kids dance earlier in the evening. The rooms were good but the family room with an extra bathroom and separate room (with door) was fantastic! They even have separate doors to the balcony so you can get little ones to sleep and then feel like you can move about. The 3 pools were wonderful. There seemed to be one for each mood: 1) fun  noisy with lots of things to do 2) full sun for baking in 3) quiet with trees  fountains. Beach was fabulous and ocean good for swimming in. Loved the fact that no one was trying to sell us anything (no time shares, hair braiding, trips etc.) If you wanted these you could approach the vendors but otherwise you were left alone. Grounds were gorgeous!Only issues we had were sun beds are hard come by. A person needs to get up early to stake their claim. My brother had a problem getting his VIP room but this was more to do with Air Transat /Nolitrous than the resort. A person really doesn't need to upgrade anyway. If you have a room facing the Italian stage its *very* noisy from 10-11pm. We just stayed out of the room till 11 each night. My parents asked, and had no trouble, moving to the other side of the building which was quieter. Long story short: our big group with very different tastes  likes all loved the resort and hope to return next year, this time for 2 weeks! ',GOOD,
'Should be called "Tropical Paradise" May 11 鈥?18, 2007My mom, daughter and I (three generations of women) spent a wonderful week at the Tropical Princess celebrating a very special birthday. In honour of this special celebration, our travel agent had made note of this and also requested an ocean view room. We booked with Conquest and flew Skyservice. In the Conquest book, and also our travel agent told us, that if you purchase to stay at the Caribe Princess, you will have privileges to go to the Tropical Princess but not vice versa. This is not true! We spent our entire week at the Caribe pool. I truly feel this is a gimmick where they try to get consumers to dish out additional unnecessary money.The plane departed as scheduled at 6:25 a.m. and our flight was good. Once we arrived in Punta Cana, it was a bit of a walk from the plane to the airport; to the baggage claim area and then back outside to a parking lot full of buses, mini-vans and cars.Our check in was quite quick, however, when we arrived to our room, our balcony faced a fence (and the tennis courts), our mirrored closet doors were smeared with brown spots and the room had a bit of an odor. Needless to say, we were not happy. We called and eventually returned to the front desk to sort this out. At first, the Front desk was not very accommodating even after we explained the request for an ocean view room due to this special birthday. We waited for our Conquest rep, Wendys, who had good connections with the hotel staff and, in the end, they gave us another room overlooking one of the three pools. It wasn't ocean view but then it wasn't a fence either!We found the rooms very standard but clean. There was only a closet and no dresser and we lived out of our suitcases. The rooms were always cleaned late in the day and towels were almost never available before 5:00 p.m. We have been to Cuba a number of times and always enjoyed the little treats that our maid surprised us with 鈥?swans made out of towels, our beds turned down at night, candy on our pillow 鈥?the only thing we got on a daily basis was our bedspread turned to look like a bow. We did have mosquitoes in the room and should have brought bug spray. We took clothes, candies, toothbrushes, gums, shoes etc. with us and gave most of it to our maid and staff at the buffet restaurant. Before leaving, we went to the Dollar Store and Bulk Barn and filled up on items that come at a very high price to the people in the Dominican. They did appreciate this.Both the Lobby and the Theatre where the evening shows are performed are located next to each other and are a bit of a walk from the hotel rooms. We went to the Lobby twice 鈥?once because we were lucky to encounter one of the trams and hopped on and the second time we ended up walking.Note: 1.Make sure you remember to pack all the essentials 鈥?prices in their four shops are outrageous. My daughter forgot to bring her mousse and spent $22 US for a can of mousse, however, a package of cigarettes was $4 US;2.Internet is available in the Lobby for $5 US for 25 minutes;3.If you need to call home, call from your room and charge it to your room at $3 US per minute. We tried to call collect the first two days and were told they could not put the call through. On each phone, there is also a number that can be used to call collect directly, however, when you try it, the call never goes through. I also investigated whether we could call using our credit card but thought better of it once I was advised that there would be a $29 US charge for the connection and $3 US per minute after that. The best deal is the internet in the Lobby or charge the call to your room.The grounds of the Tropical Princess are glorious 鈥?green, lush, spotless, palm, coconut trees and flora everywhere. They are very large and again a bit of walk from one place to another.There are three large pools on the property and, as stated above, we spent our entire time at the Caribe pool. The Animation staff is very friendly, hard-working and tries to engage the tourists to join in their many daily activities 鈥?although they are not pushy.The beach was surreal and lots of it! White pristine sand that takes you for miles and miles鈥? I walked one side of it and passed the Punta Cana Princess and LTI hotels. Ocean was a little choppy and it was quite shallow for the first 50 feet or so. I ended up just putting a beach chair in the ocean and tan at the same time!The food was very good. The buffet restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and plenty of it. We ate our breakfast and most dinners at the buffet restaurant. Breakfast was an abundance of the usual 鈥?ready to order eggs/omelets, bacon, potatoes, plantain, oatmeal, several varieties of breads, yogurts, freshly squeezed juices (cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple) and lots of fresh fruits. The only thing that surprised us was that they did not have any cereal on their menu. Lunch was a selection of pizza, wings, hamburger, hot dog, French fries etc. from the poolside restaurant. We had lunch one day at the buffet restaurant and were treated to grilled calamari. Our dinners were at the buffet restaurant and they offered a variety of fresh pasta and, each night was a different grilled fish 鈥?grouper, kingfish, baby lobsters, shrimp. There are eight ethnic restaurants on the property that require advance reservations. We ate at the Italian one night, Mamma Mia, and it was really good. The pasta dishes were great (don鈥檛 order the tortellini 鈥?they are very small!) and the appetizer/salad buffet was excellent. If you are going to eat at any of the specialty restaurants, book these as early as you arrive, otherwise, you'll not get a reservation or get a late one.There were a number of excursions available, however, we all went on this vacation to rest, therefore, did not take advantage of any. My daughter did want to swim with the dolphins but we were quickly talked out of it as it was considered an expensive excursion ($85 US) for two minutes with the dolphins. Friends that we met down there did go to Santo Domingo but said that it was a very looooooooong day (4 hours to get there, 5 hours to come back, and a lot of walking in very hot weather!)You are probably thinking 鈥?what a long review! This is because it truly was a wonderful holiday, irrespective of the few negatives mentioned above.. The major disappointment, and really, the only one, was what happened on our return. From the first day of meeting our Conquest rep, she emphasized the importance of checking our departure flight information listed in the Conquest binder in the Lobby and to be on time to board the bus at 8:10 a.m. from the Lobby. We had an 11:30 a.m. flight departure. We checked the Conquest binder the evening before we left and the morning as we waited for the bus to pick us up for the airport. The bus arrived late and we left at approximately 8:25 a.m. from the hotel. At approximately 9:20 a.m. in line at the Skyservice counter, I was informed by one of the women who also stayed at the Tropical Princess that she had just asked the VIP staff (the airport Conquest reps) if our flight was on time and was told that it hadn鈥檛 left Toronto. The Toronto flight was to leave at 6:25 a.m. which meant it was to have landed at 10:30 a.m. I went over and spoke with the VIP person in charge and asked for details 鈥?they didn鈥檛 have any. I questioned him about when he received this information and why we left the hotel when they knew the flight hadn鈥檛 even departed. He was very rude and told us that he had received a fax at 8:00 a.m. 鈥?finished, end of story. Given this information and that it was now 9:30 a.m. (3 hour delay) and departure time was not known, why not take us back to the hotel as the buses were still there. He told me it was up to Skyservice. When we got to the Skyservice counter, I enquired whether this was true and, if so, I wouldn鈥檛 be checking in my luggage and asked to be taken back to the hotel. They didn鈥檛 speak English and proceeded to check us in and took our luggage. Then they sent us one counter over to pay our $20 US departure tax and then pointed us to the 鈥渋mmigration鈥?line. By this time, everyone was upset that nobody was talking to us and everyone seemed to be ignoring us. We were being ignored by both Conquest and Skyservice and their attitudes were deplorable. We didn鈥檛 receive any customer service and we certainly were not represented by Conquest or Skyservice. We had to battle it out ourselves. We demanded to speak with someone in charge and we wanted answers. It turned out that the 6:25 a.m. flight did leave Toronto on time but, once in the air, returned to Toronto because of a malfunction. They were awaiting a part for the plane and no one knew how long this would take. Skyservice wanted us to check through immigration and then they would provide us with a 鈥渟nack鈥? It was now 10:30 a.m., plane still in Toronto, no part had arrived, needed time to install part upon arrival, four hour flight to Punta Cana 鈥?you do the math! Skyservice then decided it was going to take all the passengers to a nearby hotel for lunch and then we鈥檇 all return to the airport. We flatly said no to that and continued to demand that they return us all back to our hotels, at their cost, with our luggage. It was a long fight but they did concede and took all the passengers to the Catalonia resort for the day while they arranged for another carrier to take us back to Toronto. We ended up leaving Punta Cana at 11:30 p.m. and arrived in Toronto at 4:00 a.m. I know for a fact that had we not pursued this and demanded customer service, we would have spent the entire day and night at the airport in 32 degree heat!I realize that these situations do happen, however, you book with a particular tour company and it鈥檚 their job and responsibility to advise you, keep you up to date, provide some answers and show some respect and sympathy for these types of situations. We received none of this by neither Conquest nor Skyservice. It is truly when a problem arises that the greatness is measured and in our case, there was none. There was not one happy soul in the whole group that would disagree with this. I will definitely never forget this occurrence and the companies involved.Yes, we had another day in Punta Cana but we had to work for it! We value customer service in Canada and these two companies could take some lessons.Bell Family, Richmond Hill ',GOOD,
'Great place to relax Stayed there 7th to 14th May and was very impressed by the facilities on offer.We were offered the VIP upgrade but did not take it, and at the end of the day it was not needed.Food was plentiful and very edible, with service that many top class restaurants would struggle to match. Always a cheery and friendly welcome.Rooms were clean and well looked after. We did have a couple of minor problems which were sorted out - lights failed a couple of times and toilet flush handle broke. But guest services (Ingrid) were always on the ball and sorted things out. When I rang to report one problem I found that themaid had already reported it and maintenance was on its way.Beach is superb very clean and always had room availabele, likewise the pool areas had ample seating etc.Most days we were up and about at 6.30 walking the beach and grounds. Hotel staff would be working already keeping gardens tidy, cleaning pools etc.Fresh coconuts were about from own trees and the gardeners would open them right then and there for you.Reception area is a room to see, it is open sided with marble floors etc. Very nice and very efficient.No tips were expected but appreciated when given Would I go there again - yes without question.

'Great vacation, very few negatives My girlfriend and I spent two weeks from April 12th to the 26th. We were met by friends for the last week. We all had the VIP which I do recommend booking through your travel agency not at the resort. (cheaper)First off I will start with the few small things that bugged me while I was there.First, the Italians. I found them to be very rude and figure they had to be treated better than everyone else. One morning I really wanted to try archery and so I did. I went there in the morning when it opened and there are two targets/ranges. One range being used by two men (Italian). And the other being used by everyone else. In 45 minutes I got to shoot three arrows, while the Italians had shot well over 50. I asked them if we could use their range and take turns but they shook their heads and act like they didn't understand anything and continued to shoot. Very rude. It was a minor problem and I shrugged it off and continued on.The only second problem I had outside of all the Italians was when my friend arrived into my second week for his first week. They arrived later in the evening and when they got food and their baggage we all went swimming in the ocean. We were lightly wrestling around when his bracelet caught mine and fell into the ocean. We went to the front desk at around midnight to get a new one. The guy said you had to have to old one or it was 50$ US. Long story short he came back in the morning and was very firm with the manager and finally got his bracelet for free. In the hotel room book it says they charge 2$US per bracelet. So just watch out for money scams. Most employees only earn 6-8$US per day.Rooms were great but try not to get a ground floor room in the cayenne sp? building close to the 24 hours bar/snack bar, it can be very loud. Also the italian theatre, yes they have their own theatre, but it pales in comparison to the shows at the international theatre. The lirio building with the lower number, IE) 3201-3210 are closer to the beach and father away from the theatre.Food is great at the buffet and I never had a problem with the variety, although I am not a very picky eater. The al a cartes were fantastic, although I wouldn't recommend the lobster pieces and the Chinese, go for the duck, mmm. The other restaurants I found really good and always better than the buffet.Water sports were fun, catamarans and boogie boarding. Went banana boating once although with the VIP you get 1 hour per person per week of motorized water sports which include banana boating or a trip out to see the old tanker wrecked on the reef.Rooms, fine, always clean no problems. Although on our second week we are supposed to get a small bottle of rum and three cigars (per week) and after 4 days of calling and talking to guest services in person I finally got it delivered.The spa was great, we went the first week for our 20 min massage(VIP) and the next week we had to add 25 mins to our next one because it was so great. I believe it was 35$ for 25 extra min on top of our VIP. Very nice spa and massage rooms.Oh and the walk to the lobby is at most 10 mins from the rooms if you walk extremely slow. it took 10 mins most of the time because we were always stopping to take pictures of the beautiful scenery and animals.Theatre shows are extremely good and the Icebreaker show is always funny. Sit in the front row and its a sure thing you will get on stage once or twice.The Dominican staff are very friendly...not much to say about the Italians. The pool bar is great...can get in real trouble there. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat, but I think I might try something else in punta cana as this is my first time down there so I can compare. But any questions, send me a message. will try and get back to you asap. ',GOOD,
'Enjoyed our Week and Comments for Improvements We had the pleasure of enjoying a great week - April 10-17/07 - at Tropical Princess. We enjoyed everything that the resort had to offer - the beach, the food, the entertainment, the drinks and the new friends that we made. It was an experience.Preface to say that we would go back but there are issues that should be addressed to help make the trip and the time at the resort as enjoyable as one expects it to be. The following comments are intended to be viewed as constructive commentary with the pupose being that improvements can be made.It was a beautiful resort but be aware that it shares common facilities with Caribe Club Princess - same site but 2 resorts. We were told that there are approx 55 resorts in Punta Cana and that they are located on approx 20 sites. Thus many resorts share common facilities. We flew down on Sunwing after leaving Toronto at 6:30 am. This was the first concern we had given that we were told the flight leaves at 6:10 am and that we should be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure 3:00 am. The reason we did not leave until 6:30 am was because regulations prohibit departures before 6:30 am. So why doesn't Sunwing adjust its schedule accordingly and indicate departure as 6:30 am.This early departure also become a problem on arrival at the resort. We arrived at 11:30 but check-in is at 3:00 pm. Again, why does Sunwing have such an early departure schedule when you can't even get into your room until 3:00 pm. Once we got to our room and on to the beach, all the recliner chairs were occupied. Like many others who have commented before, you have to get to the beach at 6:30 -7:00 am to reserve beach chairs and sombrias. We were surprised, actually we were appalled, at how many of these chairs/sombrias were reserved yet not occupied for the entire day. This was evident the entire week that we were there. The resort management should have at look at this problem and ensure that, first, there are enough chairs for the number of guests at the resort for that week and, second, that using security staff, chairs that are not occupied for considerable period of time (over 2 hours) be made available to those who have come to spend time on the beach.We also had an issue with towels in our room - either no towels at all on arrival, only 2 sets of towels when there were 3 of us in the room, etc. As a suggestion aimed at basic custormer service, management should advise housekeeping how many are staying in each room so that we do not have to go chasing after housekeeping for towels.Sunwing should also adjust is departure from Punta Cana as that was some experience having to leave the resort at 7:30 am (before breakfast) and sit at the airport for 3 hours (why such a long time) when we could have left the resort at a more reasonable time (after all,check out at the hotel is 12:00 noon) given that the processing at the airport did not require 3 hours.

'5th times a charm! Let me start by saying that this was the fifth time that my family has stayed in Punta Cana, and we have loved it each time- OBVIOUSLY! I鈥檓 a 19 year old girl, my brother is 30, and my parents are in their mid-50s, early 60s. So it鈥檚 safe to say that we covered all age groups, except for the little ones, but I can tell you that I I鈥檒l start by telling you things that you won't find in other reviews, and then talk about the usual things (food, beach, room, etc.) The Princess Chain is just like Riu, or Barcelo, both of which I have previously been to. If you speak Italian then Tropical Princess is for you! They have their own section of the beach, and night-time entertainment, which is right next to the main restaurant. The Beach is divided into 2 parts, 1/3 is for the Italians and the other 2/3rds are for Caribe Club, because they have more people staying there. At Tropical Princess all the games are catered to Italians, and there is no translations, it just all in Italian. I wasn鈥檛 aware of this when booking, so I booked for that hotel. Luckily Caribe Club Princess is right next door, and we did everything with them. That is where most of you will want to book, because they are like any other hotel chain. If you are French, or speak French you鈥檒l love Caribe Club even more. 45% of all the people staying at Caribe Club are French, and 25% are North American (I asked the Animation Team). There is a group of French-speaking workers who are a team with the Animation guys, and they are from 鈥淓l dorado鈥?or something like that. There are about 3 guys, and 3 girls, and they work in the mini-club (for kids) as well as teach the water aerobics and all the other things that the Animation team does. Now on to the actual resort鈥?br/>When you arrive at the Princess hotel you will be AMAZED at the lobby. It is spacious, and if you are a night-life person, you will spend most of your evening around there. When entering the resort you will see the tennis courts to your right, and just behind it is the disco. When you pass the lobby again on the right is the entertainment area, which is where they have their big shows. While I was staying there I saw their version of the play 鈥淭he Lion King鈥?and they had some other great shows, all professionally choreographed. You can either take their mini-train or walk to your room, where you will meet a fork in the road. This is where Caribe and Tropical separate, but you鈥檒l soon see that they are right next to each other! (the only thing that separates them are the mutual dinning areas) walk a bit further an you will see your main pool, beach bar and grill (with never ending meals- nachos, roasted chicken, burgers, fries, and of course all you can drink services). Lastly, you will see the beautiful beach with little shade areas, which people reserve, even though it says you are not supposed to, and the clear ocean! (Pictures do not do the beach service! The waves are AMAZING! And you could stay in there forever!) ROOMS:If you do decide to stay at the Tropical Princess, stay in the beginning of the 3000s. That鈥檚 where I was, and we were the closest to the beach, and everything else for that matter. But really, it doesn鈥檛 matter, because everything is so close to everything else. The room I shared with my brother had two queen sized beds, and a nice big washroom, which was actually bigger than our parents! There was a connecting door for my parents and us, that we used all the time, for wake-up calls, etc. My parent鈥檚 room was really big, having a king sized bed, and a patio to put clothes out to dry, which we didn鈥檛 have. RESTURANT:The main restaurant is steps away from all the hotel rooms. The service is prompt and the people working there become your best friends in no time. There was this one guy who would cut the fresh fruit, and I don鈥檛 know if he liked me, but he would cut half of a papaya for me, and a whole mango for me, so that I wouldn鈥檛 have to choose from pieces that everyone else chose from. (Did I mention that was before the tip?) There was a variety of food to choose from. 鈥淪taples鈥?that you could count on were their soups (they were really good!) and the variety of thin crust pizzas that were inhaled by guests. There was always something special there, usually based on the theme of the night (Italian, Asian, Seafood, etc.) BEACH:Pure white sand and clear blue ocean. Not enough for you? OK! Wake up EARLY!!!! Even if you have to wake up at 5am, and then go back to bed. You want to get your spot early in the morning, whether it鈥檚 near the pool, or someone on the beach. Don鈥檛 expect to wake up at 11 and find a place. Good luck with that! Just before you go on the beach you will see an activity booth, which is where the Animation team is. They give you your towels from 9am-6pm. But don鈥檛 expect a new towel at 6pm, you might not even get a card, in which case they鈥檒l put your room number and the amount of towels you need on a paper, and give it to you the next day (can you tell that I hung out there a lot?) At the Activity booth you can borrow beach volleyballs, pool volleyballs, putters for mini-golf, and they had something that looked like mini-tennis rackets, that you can use at the volleyball court. The grill at the pool has a washroom to the right of it that is ALWAYS in use, and has a line of at least 2 people. But at the grill, the food is great if you are too lazy to go to the main restaurant to have lunch. You can have hotdogs, burgers, nachos, roasted chicken, these crunchy meat-filled crispy things (the technical term) and pizza. NIGHTLIFE:At 9:45 they start their 鈥淚CE BREAKER SHOW鈥?which is about 20 mins. Then they give out the certificates for the games that were played all day. Their night-shows last till about 11. After that, everyone goes to the lobby, and they party till 12. Those parties were fun, you get to see some great dancers, and if you鈥檙e too old to go to the club, or your kids don鈥檛 want you coming to the club with them (Like I said to my parents) then this is your time to have fun. I would dance with my dad all the time here, and we had a ball! Next, everyone goes to the club, which makes you pay for drinks, since locals can get it. Don鈥檛 worry, it鈥檚 still safe. There are too rooms. The first room plays Euro music, which has hardly anyone in there, and it ends up becoming the room that people go to make-out in. The other room plays EVERYTHING and has a cool black-light, so wear white, it looks really hot!Do me a favour; say hi to Jonathan, Victor, Eric, Fez, Ramzi, J-Louis (aka JLo) Julio, Geraldo, Santo, and all the other Animation guys for me. Tell them their Indian Princess says hi. ANIMATIONJulio is like the head of these guys, even though he鈥檚 3rd in command, really nice guy, and is there to make your stay as funny as possible. He does this funny horse impression and really knows how to make funny facial expressions (you鈥檒l want pictures of that!)Jonathan hits on EVERY GIRL! (no matter what age!) and expects you to ask how he is, before you ask for your towels. Just say hi, how are you, and then tell him how many towels you need. DO NOT TIP HIM! He gets insulted if you give him a dollar ( I saw his reaction after someone did)Victor is this young guy who just started working there. His English isn鈥檛 all that great, but he鈥檚 a quick learner. He will dance with anyone who wants to learn, and he鈥檚 a great teacher. He and Geraldo are like best friends, and both are willing to do anything to make sure you have a great time. Geraldo is so funny, and can dance!Eric and Santo are the DJs there, and they do the music at the night-shows, and at the lobby parties. They play GREAT music there. Fez, JLo and Ramzi are French workers, but are so nice. Fez runs the ping pong, and all three do the translations for a lot of what goes on there. Hope this helps.

'real nice resort This is a lovely resort with very well maintained grounds. They are spotless. It almost feels like you are in a national park setting. In the front section of the grounds is a mango tree perserve. The staff is real friendly, much better than cuba. The food is fine. The one night the 12 of us went to one of the a la carte restarants the food was sub par so we decided to stick with the buffett which had a different theme every night. THe resort has three pools which we really liked. They go from extremely noisy to very quite. The beach here is teuly magnificant. LOng ,wide and pretty clean. THe sand is white and fine and the water very warm. The rooms, well not that great but ok. Try to get in the newest section for a better room. Did I say we where there April 12 - 19, 2007. ',GOOD,
'Tropical Princess is Great! We were very happy with our week at the Tropical Princess!We travelled from East Coast Canada via Sunwing, and were impressed with this charter airline and its services. We were offered champagne, a meal with wine, and complimentary drinks (non-alcoholic) and snacks on the outward flight, with the same, sans champagne, on the return to Canada. We had prepaid for seats with extra legroom, and were happy we had done so....loads of room!Tropical Princess, and its sister resort Caribe Club Princess, function as one large resort, with guests having access to all facilities, although having to pay a little extra, sometimes, if you had not paid for VIP service.Our room was spotless, and had two double beds - very, very comfortable. Housekeeping service was great. We used only one of the three large, free form pools at this resort, and found it clean and cool - but not too cool!The beach is beautiful, and we spent a lot of time floating around in the azure ocean - we were very surprised at the large number of people who don't seem to stick even one toe in the water, at any time! The resort is lovely, with well landscaped grounds, prowling peacocksand other birds, a few small shops to buy things at greatly inflated prices (by my reckoning, suntan lotion would set you back about $25 or $30 US, so take lots from home!), pretty buildings, friendly staff. We could always find something good to eat (although we were not brave enough to sample some of the more exotic offerings) and I am still dreaming about the flan available at this resort. La Creperie was great for an afternoon snack of ice cream (try the coconut!) or a sweet or savory crepe offering.We were also happy with the drinks we were served, whether at a restaurant, the lobby, the beach or a pool bar. Coco Loco and Pie Pie(I am not sure whether I am spelling that correctly) were my personalfavorites - yes, way too sweet, but really good! Even though there are a few glitches in this, as in any, resort, the one thing we'd like to note is that this resort does not seem to haveenough beach and pool chairs for the number of guests - either that, or many people are reserving chairs at both the beach AND pool. Itseemed the whole resort was up and at it early in the morning (prior to 7:00 a.m.) 'reserving' chairs.The lack of chairs and 'late arrival' of those who thought they had reserved chairs by virtue of placing their towels or other belongingson them - which were subsequently removed by other people - served as a source of entertainment for us as we sat on the beach, sunning ourselves and people watching. Loud arguments ensued in a variety of languages......All in all, however, we would return to this resort in an instant! ',GOOD,
'loved the weather I recently visited the resort (Tropical Princess/Caribe Club Princess) in Punta Cana from April 9-16 2007 with some family members. We had a great vacation. The resort was well kept. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The bartenders at the main lobby were great. Dominga knows how to mix great drinks. Our concierge James was very helpful and friendly. He made my birthday an enjoyable experience. The only problem we had with the hotel was with our VIP package. We arrived on Monday but only received our full VIP package on Wednesday after continiously requesting it. James, the concierge, was the only person helpful in providing us with our package. The guest service representative would tell us we would have our package in the room waiting for us but the robes, beach towels, premium liquor, cigars, etc. would not be in the room. The spa facility was great. The Gym was Ok (equipment was fair however a personal trainer is available)The food at the a la carte restaurants were good especially LaCava, The Brazillian, Mexican, Japonese and Italian. The VIP package is the way to go because the superior rooms are standards, nothing to special. Don't expect luxurious accomodations by getting a VIP package however you don't spend a lot of time in the rooms. The rooms were clean. What else do you expect from a 4 star hotel. The nightly entertainment shows are OK but could use some modernization. Certain shows were boring. A lot of people would gather in the main lobby after the shows for a few drinks. This was very nice. They also had dancing in the lobby between 11:00 and midnight before people heading out to te night club which was next door. The entertainment staff were very friendly and would get people to participate in the daily activities. If you are looking for a reasonable price resort with some activities, this resort is OK. If you like shopping/ bartering we would recommend the location because about a 10 minutes walk to the market on the left side of the beach and a 25 minute walk to the right side of the beach. beautiful beach!

'Stayed at the Tropical Princess in April Like most of the DR hotel reviews, the ones on the Tropical Princess were mixed. We booked with some confidence about the place, but with lowered expectations regarding food and accommodations.Overall, the stay was above average and we got a good package deal.Food:The food at the buffet (La Higuero) was pretty sufficient most of the time. Formulaic food stations that would vary their dishes a bit based on time of day (breakfast vs. lunch vs. dinner) or each day by cultural theme. One day it was Mexican, another day Asian, another day Seafood. Go expecting generic quality and you'll be ok. None of the cultural specialties were any better than a restaurant here in Toronto that specializes in that cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Seafood, Steak). However, it was all pretty much passable. The pasta bar was pretty decent and sometimes busy. The omelettes, teppanyaki, seafood mix, were also pretty decent. I would recommend going with most of the cook-to-order food stations, as the food seemed to be fresher and you had some choice with ingredients. The pizza station was popular but pretty weak tasting. The funny thing was everything tasted just a little bit different than here. Even mainstream things like hamburgers and hotdogs, but not offensive at all. The service at the buffet is very quick, attentive and friendly.One of the only things I didn't like was the fact that it is outside (covered, but you still get the odd fly).The Brasilian ala carte is included in the standard package as is the Dominican. We found the Brasilian pretty weak and the Dominican abit better - the steak and grouper were good.Although it says the dress for dinner at the ala cartes is pants only, long shorts and a decent shirt will be ok.Got a bit of upset stomach, but nothing some Pepto couldn't solve.Accomodations:The superior room was decent - clean with ceramics but a bit rustic.We had an issue with small red ants the 2nd day on the wicker table.Called housekeeping and they came and sprayed some form of Spanish Raid all along the edges and inside the wicker. We had to leave for a few hours and didn't put anything edible on the table afterwards, but never saw another ant the rest of the trip. However, these small mosquitos seemed to get into the room because the hallway is open to the outside and they would come in when the door was open. We couldn't hear them but I woke up the first day with 6-8 bites on areas of my arms not covered by clothes. I wore a long sleeve shirt,trackpants and socks after that and had less bites. The TV has cable and gets a fair number of English stations. The bathroom was fine and the walls were soundproof but the doors are paper thin wood. Add in the open concept hallways that echo and you could hear people talking in hallways or moving suitcases and furniture on the upper level.The Resort:There can be a lot of walking because the resort is big and spread out between the units, beach, main pool, main lobby and concierge. I could see how it might be hard if you were immobile or elderly. We were at the Trinitaria unit which was a bit farther away from the main pool and buffet so a little more walking, but also a little more quiet.The beaches are nice - hot sand and a bit of a breeze. Temperature is a bit humid but we had 7 straight days of sun with no rain. The A/C in the room had trouble keeping up on the plus 30c days. There are 3 pools and lots of free activities all day. You have to get up pretty early to grab a beach hut or poolchairs.The Kids club is quite good and for 7 dollars its like a full day of babysitting and activities if you want. Stuff like outdoor pool games, pingpong, banana boat rides, soccer, tennis and they'll even take the kids to lunch.Everyone at the resort was generally friendly. We didn't run into anyone rude at all. Tipping early and often helps. I would also bring lots of 1 and 5 dollar bills. Not too many people have USD for change and you don't want to have to exchange while you are there, as you'll lose based on the rate. Also, if you take a trip to the Tower Princess Casino you can only play certain games in USD. The ATM's only dispense DR peso's.The Spa is a bit expensive and there is a free gym which is small butadequate.Overall, it was an above average resort. ',GOOD,
'Nice Place We just returned yesterday from the Tropical Princess in Punta Cana. The resort was nice and the staff were great. We enjoyed our stay at the resort, but were extremely disappointed with SunWing Travel group. We booked with SunWing (and did not get the best deal) but went with them anyway. It all sounded great. Enough about SunWing for now.Upon our arrival at the resort, we were treated well and escorted directly to the door of our room with bellboy and all. The resort was well kept and fairly clean. The pool with the swim up bar could use a little TLC, but was okay. The other 2 pools were great. Getting lounge chairs each morning was fairly painless as long as you are up and out with your towels between 7:30 and 8:30 am you'll locate loungers. We were travelling with 3 of use (2 adults  1 teenager), so were looking for 3 loungers each morning and would find 3 with no problem between the 3 pools or the beach. The only time we had problems with locating loungers was on Thursday and Friday of our week (the last 2 days of our trip). Thursday was the start of the Dominican holy week, so many Dominican's came to the resort, increasing the number of guests. Then a flight to London, Eng had mechanical problems so all of those individuals were relocated for 2 additional resorts, including the Tropical Princess, increasing the number of guests yet again. The food was fairly good, but grew tiring about half way through the trip. Thank god for the pasta bar in the buffet (El Huegero). The buffet was clean and there was lots of selection, but seemed the same everyday, with a couple of twists each evening. The Brazilian restaurant was very good and the wait staff were amazing. El Pilon (Dominican restaurant) was okay, but some of the wait stuff were pretty dull and not overly friendly. This would include the bar between El Pilon  El Higuero. The bar staff at this location on the resort, were more hassled by drink requests than anything else. The staff at the beach bars were relatively better, especially if you tipped consistently (they seem to remember who tips and who doesn't). Only problem with the beach bars is that there is only one bartender at each bar, but numerous people waiting and no order whatsoever.The Activity Centre staff were incredible. There was constantly activities on the go and they did a great job getting people involved without being pushy. From water aerobics, to dance lessons, beach volleyball, waterpolo, you name it they did it. Then they have quiet time for a couple of hours each afternoon and start up again around 3pm until 6pm. The rooms were clean and we were well looked after. We left our roomcleaner $2 USD each day and she insured we had clean towels each day and there was lots of water and soda left in the fridge for us. The beds were okay, but I question whether there might have been a few bibits in the room each evening.There are tons of things for young kids to do (under 12 years) and the Kids Club staff do a lot of good stuff with them. For teenagers, unless they are super outgoing there isn't a lot. The Teen Club is a small building with a couple of pool tables a foozball table and some music, but nothing more going on for them. Our son had a good time (13) but didn't get interactive with much. He met some others his age, but everyone we met either spoke French, Spanish or German. Very few english speaking folks on the resort. The only english speaking we met were those on our flight. Thank goodness we are bilingual.Day trip was fantastic. We book with Bavara Safari, which is an all day excursion. Pick up at 8:30 am and return at 5pm. It is $80USD per adult and is all inclusive and worth every penny. Spent the day seeing a real dominican family home, sugarcane plantation, visiting the market, a village school, a mountain ranch where they feed you, take you for horseback ride, make cocoa and coffee and then head to a public beach and all the while, constant drinks (beer, rum, water, soda) on the ride itself. All in all it was a good time and the weather was great. I would recommend for families with small children as there is lots for them to do or even couples without children, as there is a disco at the front of the resort and a 24 hour bar and snackbar at the beach.We enjoyed our time there, but by comparison to other places we've travelled to in Mexico (baja and yucatan) and the Turks, we will probably not return to DR. ',POOR,

'An excellent vacation resourt We stayed at the Tropical Princess from March 17-26.We have vacationed in the Carribbean for the past 10 years and found Punta Cana to have an excellent beach.Tropical Princess is not a resourt you would immediately pick out of the book because it seems small but keep in mind two resourts actually use the same facilaties.The rooms were clean and staff very friendly.The VIP package was part of our travel agents promotion and it was worth it.Liquors such as Baileys and Grand Marnier ,bottled beers such as Miller and Heinikein could be had by simply signing your name and room number.The buffet was very good especially the chicken.We always had a nice omellete in the morning.House wine was fair but the champagne was good.We ate at the Italian,Mexican,Chinese,and LaCava.All were excellent but not very busy.We left on one excursion for Sonia Island;This was a nice change but definitely not worth the money.The Sun Wing rep oversold us on this one-a very long day with lots of people trying to sell you things!My wife really enjoyed the 20 minute Swedish massage.The walkway from the lobby to the rooms is very beautiful with lots of wildlife such as ducks,peacocks,and other birds.We would recommend this resourt. ',GOOD,
'Great Mother/Daughter Vacation My daughter (age 17)  I just returned from our annual mother/daughter vacation. Were at the resort from March 13th to the 20th. First time to the Dominican for us. Usually have travelled to Cuba. Love it there! Thought we'd try something different this year. Flight: We flew with Sunwing. Great Flight actually arrived early into Punta Cana. Hot breakfast served! Great service. Transfer: Very smooth! Cleared customs, retrieved our luggage and found the sunwing booth no problem. They directed us to our bus. Make sure to ask them were to locate the bus as even though they are numbered they are not parked in sequence. Found our bus which was a coach and had air conditioning. One word of caution. If your bus is dropping off vacationers to other locations before your stop be sure to glance out the window when they unload luggage. I had been warned about this and sure enough the stop before our hotel they took our luggage off by mistake. I ran out of the bus and had them load our suitcases back on the bus. Close ONE!!!! Thank you fellow trip advisor!!!!Check In: Went smoothly. Had my daughter wait for our suitcases and went ahead to check in. We were very lucky, this will probably never happen again. Our room was ready!!!! Normally for those of you who travel frequently already know that when you arrive early your room usually isn't ready until about 3:00 in the afternoon. We were taken directly to our room at 11:00 am. Make sure to ask for your safe lock. $24 us for the week. Never been at a place where they charge for the lock but oh well it is a must when travelling. Room: Stayed in the 2nd villa. Room was clean, everything in great working condition. Airconditioning, washroom, etc. 2 double beds and balcony. Did have a vanity and area for the tv in the room but no dresser and no shelves in the closet. I leave my clothes in my luggage anyways so I didn't mind. I'm not one to unpack all my clothes. I just hang up whats needed. So that was fine. Maid service was prompt and there were always fresh towels by dinner time when we returned to our room to get ready for dinner. Always had hot water when need and good water pressure.  Pools: There are 3 on the resort. Only used the pool by our villa as it was right outside our door. Found it nice to be able to run back and forth to room if needed. Ocean was only about 2 minute walk from our pool as well. Ocean: Unbelievable, very clean beach and white sands. You could walk for miles. Ocean was little rough but oh well it was still fun!! It's very hard to beat the beaches in Cuba!!!!Food: Only tried one restaurant, the oriental. The food was amazing and very nice atmosphere. The rest we just ate in the buffet. Don't really like being on a schedule during vacation so utilized the buffet most of the time. Everynight they have a different theme. Alway a good variety to choose from. Oh yes and Creperie is amazing. Fresh crepes and icecream every afternoon!!! 2 beach bar grills close to ocean as well if you don't want to walk to the buffet for lunch. We were very careful not to eat or drink anything outside of the resort. My daughter did have a little stomach problem the last 2 days but I had taken some medication so it was no big deal. No cramps or violent sickness just a few extra visits to the bathroom needed. I think it's just the change in the enviroment. We're now home and it's been a couple days and she's fine now. I ate a variety of things within the resort and I was fine. Just remember you are travelling to a different country and be very cautious of eating and drinking outside the resort. And also be prepared take stomach medication as it can happen. Staff: All staff were very friendly and helpful. Most of the staff that work at the bar (at least by our pool), front desk and gift shops speak english. Other staff such as maids, waiters etc donot speak english. Never any issues with not being able to get questions answered. Mosquito: Yes there are mosquitos but there in ontario in the hot weather too. They are not a issue unless you happen to get a humid evening. We did have a couple of those. Just make sure you keep your balcony doors closed and because there was a small space under the door, I just put a towel down to block them from coming into the room. Old cottage habits!!!! That was only on a couple of nights though. We always take bug spray anyways, so we were prepared. But I would recommend Malaria medication because Yes there are mosquitos there. We took them, better safe than sorry. Only seen them in the early evening though. Seems like later in the evening they go into hiding. Kind of like here in the cottage country!!!Shows: Only went to 3 shows, seen one seen them all!!! Frequent traveller know what I mean!!Markets: I found very annoying. You have to barter for everything. They try to get you everytime. Very expensive! I found the gift shops on the resorts less frustrating and prices pretty much the same except you don't have to barter. Don't get me wrong I like to barter but when you're just looking for a couple of cheap keychains or tropical necklaces it becomes a 20 minute process as opposed to a 5 minute purchase unless you want to get ripped off. At the resort tshirts were $10, keychains $3 not too bad. Didn't really go to shop but we enjoy looking through markets and they are very hassling and sometimes annoying. It wasn't a very relaxing experience. Oh well, that's the Dominican! In Cuba it is not like that in the markets. People donot hassle you to buy and their souvenirs are so cheap you sometimes end up giving them more because you feel bad. The resorts however rip you off though. So it's a catch 22 whereever you go. Tours: Only did one day adventure. Went of the tour of Punta Cana area. Visited a school, house, sugar plantation  a farm. Went horseback riding (20min) and to a beach. It was a long day but very educational. I'm not the touring type of person so I would probably never do this again. However it was interesting and my daughter enjoyed it. We've always done the catamaran trips in cuba so we decided to do the cultural thing this time. Now we can say been there done that! ha ha.. To sum it up, I would return to this resort for a fun in the sun vacation with my daughter. I think however if I were to return as a family i would choose and bigger resort. Because the market experiences were very annoying we ended up spending most of our time in the resort area which was fine. My idea of a vacation is sitting by the pool or ocean and enjoying the sun. However if sitting in sun all day is not your cup of tea and you like to wonder this resort is small but quaint. It offers you everything you would want but is a smaller scaled resort. It is by no means a luxury 5 star resort but it is clean and the service was excellent. We had a wonderful time and the weather was excellent. When going on vacation my most important feature is cleanliness and we cannot complain about that. In all, this resort is a great value for what you pay. It is one of the less expensive resorts but gives you everything need to enjoy the sun..... ',GOOD,
'Pretty Good       master bedroom ',POOR,
'The Good Outweighs the Bad We went for our very first out of country vacation to this lovely resort. I reccomend the following when you travel to this location:1. Get everything you are promised in writing from your agent, the hotel and the package provider.We were promised Superior VIP and received only Superior. Big Deal you think? For us it was. We budgeted for the trip. We were told 100% all inclusive. We ended up having to pay for the restaurants that we'd been told was included. We had to pay to use internet (as it was the only way we could reach our travel agent) We were promised the bottle of rum, the three cigars (not that we smoke - but you know), the bathrobes, the beach towels and a certificate for another restaurant.2. Pay the $24(ish) for the safe. We got ripped off $100. USD So, this time around, no souvenirs.3. Bring tips for the hotel staff. We forgot twice to leave out $2 and we had to call for towels. On the last day of our stay we left early for a tour and forgot, and we didn't get clean sheets. I know this because I had a little eyemakeup on my pillowcase and it was still there. 4. Take your shoes in your carry on. They disappear.5. Make sure to get your fresh towels at the activity booth for the pool. 6. Get yer butt out of bed to reserve your beach chairs - honour system here. You put your towel on your chair and no one takes it. Very impressed with that.7. Learn Spanish!8. Be patient at the bar. It's a different style down there. A tip goes a long way in the service you receive.9. Beware of Mamajuana (no, not marijuana) It's an awesome drink - and so does the Caribe Princess. Wow, what a kick.10. Use a 30 sunblock. No kidding, I got a tan and a slight burn!11. If you are used to Broadway, you may not enjoy the shows. But they do pass the time in the evening. The discoteque isn' t that great. They should focus more on beach parties or pool parties at night. Evenings are pretty quiet.12. Get your prescription of Cipro(sp?) It sure cures the run to the banjyo's! Can't put my finger on what gave it to me...but sure appreciated the prescription.13. The food:El Pino - Dominican Restaurant. Not bad. Excellent Lamb. Not fussy on the Domincan Soup - was a stew basicallyMamamia - Italian - Great Magnifico - all four of us loved itThe Seafood - Great! Even the hubby liked the fish.La Sombrero - Mexican - Muy Bien! We even had a small mariachi band serenade us. The waiters were most fun.La Cava - very intimate French restaurant. Lovely serviceThe Daily Buffet - good lord the breakfasts were amazing! You name it , they had it. Eggs a little runny, awesome omelettes. 14. The Beach - It was beautiful. Clean white sand. Nice thatched umbrellas to hide from the sun when too hot. Chairs were a little abused. Make sure to get a flat one so you can lay on your tummy to sun...and those ones have a holder for the drinks. There is a small group of young people - Blu Club - who get you involved in all sorts of crazy activities. Wouldn't you know the first time I get up to learn to dance we have to play a weird version of musical chairs. It was a blast.15. Flora and Fauna. Not alot of variety. Some birds, most flowers weren't really out. And there were very few insects to bother us.16. Book the VIP Saona cruise. You get a great tour of the country on your way to the boat. Gives you new appreciation of the people and the country. Treated veyr well by the tour operators. Great food. They really took care of us and appreciated our business. 17. Beach stores. There is a stretch of little shacks down the beach where you can purchase local art, jewellery, t-shirts, hats, bags, rum...etc. Looking back, had I not got ripped off, I would have bought my souvenirs there. Much cheaper than on the resort. Use USD when shopping there. And bargain your purchase. Don't pay full price. One shop keeper wanted $15 USD for a small wooden carved frog. I got him down to $6 and if I didn't need to use the banjyo so bad I could'a got to $4. Mind you, I wouldn't recommend getting the alcohol there...That I would have bought at a resort shop or duty free shop. The larimar and amber jewellery is gorgeous. Just make sure of the quality of the construction. The nicer shack operators get invited on the resort during the evening near the restaurants to hock their wares...bargain there too. Don't pay the first price asking. Would I go back - darn tootin! ',GOOD,

'I will go back Hi I went to Tropical Princess with my family and friends. After reading some of the above reviews I can't resist writing one.We had a great time. The grounds are beautiful, lots of activities, the beach is very nice. The hotel has 3 pools to choose from. I am astonished that some people don't like the food. If you call food a frozen pizza then maybe you won鈥檛 like it there. The food is good and fresh; the a la carte restaurants are worth visiting. My advice for those people who complain of the staff: A little tip will work wonders. After a $1 tip they will always bring you coffee and drinks and will make up your room. It is a poor country and the people are very friendly if you are friendly with them. ',GOOD,

'Nice resort, but the front desk staff left a lot to be desired. A group of us, (14 in all), attended the Tropical for the week of December 14 to 21, 2006. Let me just say, that there are a lot of negative people writing reviews and I have often found that despite the complaints, I have usually had nothing to complain about as these resorts are generally great. I say this, because for me to complain, there had to be issues that should not occur. I also have been on several vacations to Dominican, Mexico and Cuba, incuding 4 in Dominican, including The Punta Cana Princess and Bavara Princess, which are all part of the Princess Chain, so we have come to expect good things from a Princess resort. I do note that The Tropical is not rated as high as the two other mentioned Princess Resorts. Anyway, here we go.Sunwing: We have always had good luck the few times we have used this Carrier. The planes are decent, and have very few travelling problems. This time however we were not satisfied. Firstly, about 2 weeks before our trip, Sunwing changed our time to depart from 6 AM to 6 PM, and did not change the return time and as such we lost an entire day. Suffice to say, this did not sit well with any of us. To Sunwings credit, they offered a credit on the next trip we had. We were not receptive to this as this limits your trip selection to one carrier next trip. After several calls, they credited back to our credit cards, $100 per passenger. This was fine. However when you depart at 6PM, you do not get to your resort until after 12AM, and if there are any problems, when you check-in you need to suck it up and deal with it the next day. For this reason, when we are booking trips we always look for the early departures and if we had known Sunwing was going to change the time we would have booked elsewhere. However if they change the booking time after you are booked, you are screwed. Anyway, enough complaining about Sunwing.Check-in: We did not arrive at the Tropical until 1:30 AM, so we were all tired. We were a group of 12 checking in, consisting of 4 families, and the other couple arrived the next day. There were 2 other couples in front of us also from our flight. Long story short, all couples had trouble, checking in, as the person at the front desk was just simply incompetent. The bar at the lobby was closed, no one there to greet us, no drinks while we waited. It was very annoying. Sunwing, due to their change in times, should have arranged with the Tropical, to have us properly taken care of due to their changes. The person at check-in, was so disorganized, all of the contents for each rooms envelopes, such as towel and room cards were all over the desk and mixed up. He could not get the room cards programmed etc. This should have been done before our arrival. We were unable to leave the Check-in until 3 AM, to get to our rooms. Then we partied at the beach bar until 4:30 AM.Bars: We had VIP, and this resort had a very good selection of drinks. As usual, the quality varied from bar to bar, but they were generally good and no complaints here. The employees at the bar were exceptionally friendly, especially if you exhibited some spanish words for them. Buffet: Food for the most part was delicious, with good drink service at the table. The employees here were quite friendly and helpful. There is food for everyones tastes, although hot food was sometimes cold. Minor stuff.Ala-cart: We only attended one, La Cava. I had the Steak which was good, but others in our group, were not happy with their meals. Also, the Ala-carts in general I find the food is marginally better than the Buffet, with significant waiting time, in our case we were there for 2.5 hours. This was included with our VIP package, but 2 couples did not have the VIP. The cost was $50 USD per person which was rediculous. We had however previously agreed with front management, due to the check-in fiasco, that they would not charge these couples as a peace offering. When we finished our meal the employees at La Cava insisted they needed payment to which we refused and went up to the front desk to get it sorted out. The person that had previously agreed to the 2 couples getting the meal with-out charge, said that that was the only ala-cart resturant we could not get the two couple free. At the initial time of this deal, we stated if there was a problem, please advise us and we would not attend La Cava. They never advised of the problem. Anyway, they ended up not charging us, but had us sign a waiver, that looked like a Bodily Injury release, after being paid off by an insurance company. Again, the management here is terrible.Beach: If it is not the best beach in the World, it has to be close to the best. The sand, water, just beautiful, the beach is also very clean, with plenty of chairs. The water was warm. The Bavaro beach is excellent.Rooms: We had the VIP rooms which although dated, are roomy and clean, although the bed was rock hard and broken, The frame was broken in the middle, and the front door jamb was broken leaving our room a little less than secure, although we had a safe, and all contents of value were in the safe. It looks like someone tried to break into the room in the past. Two couples had non-VIP rooms in a different building and although they were smaller, the rooms were more modern looking, with updated and nicer furniture. Must have been newer or newly renovated.Grounds: Very clean and well manicured. This resort is expansive and has jungle like walkways from the rooms to the front desk. It was a pleasant 10 minute walk from the rooms to the front desk. They have trams to deliver you but the walk was nice and the trams are too infrequent to be bothered with.Now you may think I am being too critical, and most things about this trip was great, but first impressions last, and this resort needs a management change and employee change at the front desk, and Sunwing, needs to ensure that if they are delivering us late to this resort, that they speak with the Tropical, and be ready for us, including the niceties such as a drink when we walk in to the resort. It would have made that brutal 1.5 hour check-in better. I was told by our Sunwing representative, that we should not expect the same level of service at the Tropical, that we received at the Punta Cana Pricess and Bavara Princess. While I agree with this, the decline in service usually involves, rooms that are not as nice, no beer in the barfridge, (Tropical Had this), food not as good, (was on par with the others), but not the staff at the front desk. How hard is it to check-in. I also note that this check-in is also for the higher rated Caribe Princess. So I do not get it.I will Never attend this resort again, and will rethink any attendance to a Princess resort, although we have had good luck in the past. It's a pity, because once you get past the check-in, the resort is good. First impressions however do not help. When you disappoint 12 people, plus the other 2 couples ahead of us, you are loosing a lot of would be return customers. ',POOR,
'Awesome! Will go back!!!!! Just got back from TP Sunday Dec 3 and we can not say enough about how great this resort is. The resort itself is gorgeous. The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help. The beach is just beautiful. The reviews that complained about the food....I don't think they were at the same resort as me. I am generally pretty picky about food and I just loved the food here. I had upgraded our trip to VIP as a birthday present for my boyfriend. I can tell you that it does have it's advantages BUT beware, it's cheaper to upgrade at the resort rather than through the travel agent.The only problem we had with our trip was NOLITOURS. Beware when booking with them.This resort is great and we are already trying to plan our next trip there. ',GOOD,
'Beware American Travelers This is not the first time I booked a trip to the Domincan Republic, I stayed with 11 other family memebers in Casa De Campo 4 years ago and then the experience was amazing; which now I hear and have read in TripAdvisor that that resort has turned for the worse. Anyway, 9 of us booked a trip to The Tropical Princess Beach Resort and Spa and we got a pretty good deal. The bad vibes started with our 45 minute trip from the airport to the hotel which was about 30 minutes longer than stated on the web site. We were on the shuttle bus and the guide kept telling us to make sure we met with joanne in the morning for just 5 minutes so we could shedule our return which ended up being a Timeshare sales pitch that stole mi sister for over 4 hours. We can count this one as lie number 2. So beware. You do not have to meet with anyone from the shuttle company to schedule your pick up. The room was adequate and had no technical difficulties like friends of mine that were staying at the Bavarro Princess who were switched from their rooms 3 times because the others had flooding and plumbing issues. Make sure you bring a scented candle so you can eliminate the musty smell of the room.The resort in general was very beautiful but how can you go wrong with such an amazing location. The beach is beautiful and the pools were nice.The food was horrible. The portions at the smaller outlying restaurants were pathetic it was like going to a sampling and at the Mexican restaurant they decided that it was easier to put all the meat for the chicken and beef fajitas on one hot skillet and for all of us to share from them, how ridiculous! My daughter burnt her arm with the handle of the skillet and got no response from managment. At this point I was totally beside myself. I was disgusted and just wanted to go home.Being American is a huge disadvantage at this resort. We Americans expect a certain amount of service. We want to make sure there are standards. They (the employees and management) view us as spoiled and a pain in the butt. The help sometimes acted as if they did not understand English when you asked for a drink or inquired about services. The funny part of the whole thing was that I speak fluent Spanish and I played dumb to experiment on how one is treated depending on what language you spoke, guess what, there was a huge difference. If you spokeSpanish everything was easier. The lack of information through out the resort is a major problem. In the room there is no information on pool hours, towel pick up and return at the pools, phone use, restaurant extensions, or hotel extensions.I will never return to the Dominican Republic. I am truly disgusted at the way were treated. It was like because we chose the All Inclusive trip that we should be happy for whatever we get and that one should not complain. I go All Inclusive for the convinience of not having to bring extra money for drinks and meals not because of what else I can get for FREE.Now for the braclet joke. When you arrive you are given braclets, yes braclets, they were uncomfortable and were very confusing. They were different colors and meant that you had bought into a particular package. Here is the kicker, when my sister went on the Time share sales pitch they believed that she was going to buy and told her about the trick on the bracelets. They explained to her that if you remove the pink one you are allowed to eat at the smaller restaurants without a surcharge of $15 per person.I hate the bracelet idea. Those guests who took advantage of the extra info definitely make out better. What a scam!I am convinced that the resort is run under deceptive information and for those who do not travel do not know what is right or wrong believe that the way they are treated is out of this world.Finally, to make matters worse, my whole family got sick the day of our return. For most of us it was several days of diahrea and we just dicounted it as traveler's sickness, but my little 21/2 year old niece it was a week and we finally found out that she had salmonella poisoning. This makes me think we were all infected.How terrible it was for my little niece. I am truly upset and disgusted. The food handling standards there are definitely below standard. They are so cost concious but it seems that they care less for proper food handling.My suggestion is to really search all of the resorts under Trip Advisor and read the reviews and make your choice using all the information. This resort is definitely below standards as far as service and guest sensitivity. The resort is beautiful but it is not just about beauty. I really wish that the Princess Resorts read these reviews so that they can make changes to their service and guest relations areas.I will not return to the Dominican Republic. I will make sure my family and friends do not go there either. We will spend our money elsewhere. ',POOR,
'Tropical Princess 鈥?Fantasy Island This was our first all-inclusive with our two boys, ages 5 and 8. We didn鈥檛 think this type of travel would suit us, but we are hooked. The Tropical Princess gave us everything we wanted and more. We were concerned that there were so few reviews on the Tropical Princess but we discovered The Tropical Princess and Caribe Club Princess are the same complex that share the same facilities. So if you are looking for Tropical reviews, read also the Carib Club reviews.We heeded advice from others and took a cab from the airport to the resort for US$28. This way, we avoided stopping at all the other hotels first. Still took about 40 minutes.Service:The people at the front desk were not very friendly, and I started to worry whether we were in for typical bad attitudes that you find in so many American resorts. I had difficulty with 3 different people at 3 different times on 3 different issues. However, when you get past the front desk, it鈥檚 a different world. The rest of the employees at this hotel, from the Animacion staff, the waiters at the buffet, maids, to the coconut tree trimmers were extremely polite and friendly. They will all go out of their way to help you with anything you need.We took alot of coloring books, crayons, pencils and toiletries for the housekeepers... worth the effort. They work many days in a row without leaving the property and then go back to their homes for a few days. Some people travel 9 hours from their homes to work at the resorts. The people who work there are so kind and sweet, they deserve much more than they make, so TIP GENEROUSLY! Change in US dollars is very difficult to get so we took $100 in ones and $100 in $5 and $10.I read another person鈥檚 comment that she wished she had taken her kids鈥?used and unused sporting goods. The Dominicans love baseball and any old equipment, cleats, or clothing would go over great with them. If you took down a suitcase full of stuff to give away, you could then load it up with your souvenirs on the way home and avoid that overweight charge. (Each of your bags cannot weigh more than 70 lbs, or you have to pay extra).VIP:If you are staying at this hotel, you MUST go with the VIP package. The extras are sooooo worth it. You get a gourmet dinner at La Cava, massage (20 min. each), turn down service every night, internet usage (1 hour each) and a motorized boat tour. Food:The a-la-carte restaurants were great! We personally enjoyed La Cava, Sombrero and El Rodrizzio. If you want an early supper you must book them the day before. If you are vip and want to make reservations for the restaurants you must do this at the vip conceirge stand, not at front lobby.We thought the buffet was awesome. Each meal offered at least 30-50 items, and there was a different theme each night. Even my picky kids found a plateful of food each time we ate there.Sometimes we just ate pizza, fries and burgers at the Brazilian restaurant for lunch, or visited the fabulous Creperie next door. I gained 5 lbs. on this trip!After reading all those miserable reviews about the food, I wondered how it could be that bad. It's not. Sure, the service can be slow sometimes鈥攖he dining area is huge. Yes, the lunchmeat looks sweaty and gross鈥攕o get a fresh omelet and French toast instead. OK, the hamburger meat tastes different, but not enough to cause a fuss.There are more than enough choices to keep everyone satisfied. Just go get something else.I took acidophilous for a week before I went and took pepto each day and I still had minor diarrhea. However, it worked for the rest of my family, so maybe I鈥檓 just more sensitive. The grounds:Absolutely beautiful. A mangrove swamp lines the walkway from the lobby to the resort area. There are lots of peacocks and waterfowl milling around, and at night, kids can catch toads and frogs in the gazebo area near the restaurants.The pools were quite lovely. The busy activity pool had a bar and music. The picture takers walk around with parrots and monkeys to take your souvenir photos. The zero entry warm middle pool was more low key, and could have used some music. Other than that, the pool was a hit. The third pool is beautiful, with fountains and jacuzzis all around.The beach:Soft, pale sand, clean, perfect. One of the nicest I鈥檝e ever seen. Chairs are pretty easy to come by, but if you want a palapa on the edge of the beach you have to get down before 9:00. There is no snorkeling at this beach, it鈥檚 more wave jumping and boogie boarding. $20 will get you a boat ride to a reef closeby.The room 鈥?It was quiet and comfortable, nothing fancy. Lots of hot water, good pressure. The weirdest thing to me about the whole resort was that there are no dressers! I called and talked to 3 people before a maintenance guy proved to me that there are no dressers in any of the rooms to put away your clothes. Yes, there鈥檚 a closet, but I can鈥檛 hang up size 5T t-shirts. 2 small desk size drawers under the tv as well.Bring a candle - rooms are musty. Also no alarm clock in room. Things don鈥檛 dry very well but if you hang them up it鈥檚 a little better. You can bring dryer sheets to put in the drawers and closet to keep your clothes smelling fresh.Sports:We thoroughly enjoyed boogie boarding and jumping the waves. The kids got to practice snorkeling in the pool, and we got a free boat ride (vip). We also had a blast learning to shoot bow and arrow in the archery course each day. The teen club has some very worn down pool tables, but it was a welcome diversion during a day long rain storm. The mini golf is worn down as well and looked too hot and depressing.The Kids鈥?Club looked like fun, but neither of my kids were buying it because everyone spoke a different language. (English is definitely the minority here.) They were taking the kids out on the banana boat when we saw them one day, and learning archery another time.Buying/Bringing Stuff:We heard of someone buying Pringles for 8 US$, so we brought our own. We brought American ketchup packets too, their ketchup is brown and weird. Take insulated mugs as the sand gets hot and so do your drinks.Try to take everything you think you would ever need. The prices in the gift shop were insane. Disposable camera for $20, sun tan lotion for $25, $15 dollars for immodium. Bring all types of medicine and sun block just in case to prevent from having to pay those ridiculous prices. Use bug spray in the evening to avoid bug bites. Bring TONS of sunblock - we used baby sunblock 45 SPF and still burned! A lot of humidity, so ladies don鈥檛 even think about trying to straighten your hair. I went curly all week with lots of de-frizz. A light sweater was welcomed one night. Guys must wear long dress pants to dinner.Souvenirs:When buying souvenirs on the beach, barter low. Half the price they ask is what its worth, they know the new people coming in because they are not tanned! They held up a lighter flame to a Latimer stone to prove it was real (that it wouldn鈥檛 melt). Also, when buying jewelry from vendors, sometimes the bracelets and necklaces don鈥檛 come with the clasps. You have to buy them separately.Would we stay here again? In a hearbeat! ',GOOD,
'A hundred percent in service I ent to this hotel with my boyfriend for a weekend, and for the service that they have i guess we could goback there.Maybe this hotel couldn篓t be a 5 stars hotel but in this place i almost felt like a princess , the habitations are very comfortables, but the tv channels taht they have are almost a disaster, and are very boring..In the food they don篓t have enough variety, and they repeat so much the menus, but every body of the staff, were very kind, and u莽if they see you 7 times a day it doesn篓t matter, they smile yoy and they give you a big greeting,the beach was so wonderfull and the snack was delicious,,,,,in conclution , i would like to goback there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ',GOOD,
'So So Resort I recently got back from the Tropical Princess. Not taking the all inclusive package will work to your disadvantage and lead to a horrible trip. The rooms in general could use a good amount of refurbishing and some new funrniture would be helpful. The staff was slightly unfriendly especially comapred to the Melia Caribe which i have stayed at several times. I made the wrong decision by trying someplace new. ',POOR,
'All inclusive NOT The first night it rained ,we were on the second floor of a three story building and when we woke up the next morning the floor was soaked we had trouble getting another room.The staff spoke mostly Spanish or french not good for English only.The beach was beutifull The weather was hot hot hot. We asked for all inclusive and I explained that I didn't want to pay any more unless we took trips off the resort NO SUCH THING. ',POOR,
'Very disappointed - Montreal couple :( :( After reading the numerous reviews on the website I was very excited about this hotel. What a mistake I did. Best advise is ask friends who travelled for advise, do not base yourself on reviews. Check-in very slow, staff seem to be joking amongst themself - not professional, mostly spanish (very little french and english). Rating for this hotel is no more than 3 stars (and that's pushing it) and we have travelled to Dominican Republic numerous times! Grounds are impressive, but... the lagoon smells like sewer gas. Rooms good size, BUT Air conditionaire was filthy - covered in mildew, we actually removed the filter ourselfs and found at least 1/2 inch of mildew on filter. We knew something was wrong as my husband kept on sneezing and the smell was very strong in the room. Room service sometimes late, one night we had to wait for towels until 6:30 to take a shower.We tried to have our room transfered (seems like we were not the only ones, lots of angry people at reception) and we were offered a choice of 2 rooms after a 2 hour wait in the lobby; one had a broken air conditionaire - so Not good (which they tried to fix, but no body could find the problem) and the other room was facing the buffet (which means very noisy because of clinging dishes all the time) and most importly the matress on the beds were slanted to one side (both beds!!). Not impressive after waiting an extra 2 hours in the lobby when in transit since 4 AM that day, we were exausted and I just wanted to cry from disappointment. We ended up keeping our smelly room as the options offered were worst. The Beach is beautiful, safe and very clean, BUT not enought chairs; must reserve by 6 AM and I mean it, or your out of luck. Pools are very nice and clean, you can only get towels from the main pool. Staff was very mixed, some very friendly and smiling and other staff looked mad and uncooperative. Very expensive vacation at $1,500 per person, really not worth the money!!! Gym attendant was cleaning the sand away as I was trying to figure out how the machine worked, I got no assistance from him, it was another traveller that helped me out- we were clearly bothering by being there. Buffet very greasy (oily and buttery), nothing is ever hot, never (and this is no exageration) the food is very AVERAGE. My husband started stomache problems the 2nd day there, althow they give bottled water, it was making my stomache jumpy for some reason. Lots of children seem to have la tourista on the way back in the bus. Not enough serving utentils. No napkins at table and always running after utencils, often out of spoons. THey did have fresh tropical juice which was very good, the other fountain juices are just mostly sugar, much too sweet. THe coffee is always warm, not hot and very strong. For a la carte restaurants - you must reserve the day before and expect to wait 1/2 hour for reservations; we were stuck with the Dominician restaurant (as our 1st choise was booked)- Not GOOD, but very pleasant service. People were leaving with untouched plates. The Brazilain restaurant was the only hot meal and good food we got during our stay (meat grill) very slow service. The weather was great most of week (some big rain storms at night mostly - rooms have umbrellas) we enjoyed long walks on the beach every day. Most bikes are broken or in very bad shape. We would never go back there again, unfortunately the rewiews I read did not represent the place at all. Shows/entertainment starts late, around 10:00PM for adults and everything/ buildings are far apart (no atmosphere), be prepared to walk alot (which did not bother me, but it's very hot and not much shade during day) and get perpared to line up for everything. :( ',POOR,
'Great Resort, Food not so great My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tropical Princess April 1st to the 8th 2006.. From the Airport to our resort was about a 40 minute drive. It's true 90% of the people there are crazy drivers. We had no problem with our luggage getting to the hotel with us. Once we checked in, we were told we were being given an upgrade to a Caribe Club Room. But this does not mean you get the same advantages as the Caribe Club Members, (ex. they got 5 a la carte meals included) Tropical Princess (Our package included 2) Room- Was great very nice and clean, the maids kept our fridge stocked daily, we left them little presents as well as money some days.Beach was absolutely magnificent, i can't say enough about it.Beach Chairs- Go early in the morning to reserve one, they fill up fast!The bars- They were great, If you tipped them a dollar here and there they were more than happy to see you coming. Also, the drinks are made quite strong. I recommend the Bahama Mama, or Banana Mama. Yummy!The Resort grounds- Beautifully landscaped and Maintained, Barely any flies at all!The Weather- The only day it rained was the afternoon we got there, and for the remainder of the week it was hot and sunny, with the perfect breeze off the Ocean. And when it rained our first day, it didn't rain for very long.The Food- The only negative thing was the food at the buffet, (with keeping in mind it is a 3rd world country) It wasn't as good as we'd hoped. The choices at breakfast would have been the best. For supper we recommend the a la cartes, we only had 2 included with our package, but by the end of our stay we decided to pay for the Italian a la carte, Only 10 dollars each and it was Delicious. Worth the extra money by far!Overall, beautiful Resort, Kind People, Food could have been better, We will return to Punta Cana but try a different Resort. We would still recommend this resort! ',GOOD,
'Loved it! I stayed at the tropical princess beach resortwith my boyfriend and his family from april 2nd till april 9th it was awesome! Everyday was nice an sunny the people there were really nice.Our room was always cleaned always clean towels. The food was excellent. We went to the Manati park which was very funny they had a dolphin show which was really good they had a parrot show which was also very good, and a horse show which was alright and a taino show which was good too. We also went snorkeling which was fun got to see alot a fish, It was really beautiful. We all went to the casino which was lots of fun they have a disco right in it too. The only time it rained was at night like 3-5 am. and doesnt rain long either.Anyways overall i had an excellent time an i hope to visit there again sometime in the near future. ',GOOD,
'Would go back to Punta Cana, but not to Tropical Princess My Boyfriend and I just returned from the Tropical Princess. I was very excited to go and not worried at all by the bad reviews of this place. We arrived late Saturday night, after an hour bus ride. Check in was uneventful, the man who checked us in barely even looked at us, I remember thinking he was pretty miserable. Not a good first impression. The lobby was beautiful, all open air, nice big bar, and when we arrived there were a bunch of people dancing in the lobby. Looked fun! We took a trolley to our room, which was nothing special, we were happy enough to have a king bed. But we didn't really need anything more.We were hungry after our flight so we headed down to the buffett to see what they had. They basically had snack food at that hour (makes sense) my boyfriend just had a hot dog, I don't think I ate.The beach is beautiful! The water is quite warm, I went in the ocean every day. The beach is always very busy, as everyone says it is quite difficult to get a beach chair unless you want to be up super early. The weather was great, I think it rained a couple times but always seemed to be overnight, or at night when we were inside. The staff at the beach bar were great. We tipped them most days and when they saw us coming they would start pouring a couple more beers! They were they best staff by far.The english here was a lot more limited then some other places. It was a bit frustrating, just because I would feel bad when I didn't understand. Man I need to learn spanish. :)Now the food. UGH Terrible! Now I can admit that I am a picky eater, very picky, but even my boyfriend had problems finding something to eat. I was quite disappointed in breakfast. Pancakes were good, but I got sick of them, omelets tasted like nothing. Orange juice tasted like tang! The buffett restaurant is open air, which is nice, but not around food. It looked like the meat and cheese were sweating. My boyfriend had some cesar salad and it was warm. I don't like complaining but it was the worst eating experience I have ever had, I was dying to come home by the end of it to eat.Pools were nice and warm, there are 3 of them, and easier to find chairs. The actual property is beautiful. The walk back to the lobby is great, so much lush green, lots of birds, and peacocks just walking around. I can't say enough about that.Can't say much about the entertainment, we were lazy at night, and didn't go out to the shows. The lobby is happening at night, after the shows when everyone dances.So my main beef here is with the food. I couldn't go back here just because of that. Other than that it is a nice clean resort, beautiful beach. ',POOR,
'Loved it!! My girlfriend and I visited this resort Mar 17-26th. Other then the hellish flight with Sunwing.ca (could you have any less leg room??!!!) and the 2hr delay on the tarmac in Ottawa, all was good. The 4hr waiting period at the airport returning is very very very very annoying and travel companies have got to change this stupid %$#@! rule of having to be at the airport 4hrs before your flight. Especially at 2:00am!!!!Guest services: Excellent, easy check-in (Note: the safes are $25US/week extra). My Sunwing reps was present everyday and english/french is not a probelmo with anyone at the resort.Tours: Didn't do any - seemed boring and limited. Besides, who really wants to be in the jungle in 35C weather or on the back of an overheated horse or visit another beautiful beach. Been there, done that - save your money!Room: Excellent, was on ground floor facing buffet. Lots of hot water, good pressure and clean drinking water. Nice K鈥搒ize bed! Plenty of A/C. No worries about your room.Resort: Very well layed out. Excellent fauna and greenery. Beautiful resort. 3 huge beautiful pools (quiet, open and heated and a busy one w/pool bar)Food: Plenty of choices, especially at buffet. However, if you've never been down south to a 3rd world country be prepared for odd dishes (or if you are American for that matter because they are so g*d da*n picky!), your gonna hate the food. Also, please don't blame the food for any stomach illness. Give it up people, it's not the food, it's the booze and sitting in the sun all day that is making you ill. It's aknown fact! The food is cooked, cleaned and presented as best as they can do. All resorts down south usually have foreign chefs. Fruit is awesome!!! Drinking Water: ALL drinking water at this resort come in bottles, unopened, just like bottle water at home. Very cool!!! Excellent tasting water! No fears here folks.Drinks: Limited if you aren't a VIP paid guest, however there's still lots of unlimited concoctions and of course beer, pina coladas, cuba libre (rum and coke)etc...!! Mmmmmmm... beer.Beach: Sweet!! 10 out of 10 with awesome year 'round breeze. My only complaint is that Bavaro beach as a whole is very very busy with watercrafts and watersports buzzing around all day. Plus, the every 15min. bloody helicopter tours passing by. None of these will affect your swimming and laying around, but I found the beach noisy and very busy for my liking. At least the staff leave you alone and don鈥檛 play loud music all day. Note: All resorts have same issues not just this resort. Bavaro beach is very long, beautiful sand and excellent for walking. BUT, very very busy. There are no locals at this beach.Entertainment: I was very impressed. Professional dancers and good theme shows everynight. Also, after each show they party it up in the lobby! Be there!!Kids: I have been told and seen that this is a very good resort for children. They have lots of activities for kids and the animation team is very involved with their fun!Shopping: There are a few shopping huts along the beach near the Ocean Blue resort and a Canadian run (her name is Christina) has a hut called the Carribean...something (pink bldg). Her prices are non-negotiable. There's also some good shopping plaza's near the Bavaro casino resort to buy all the crap they sell. They love to haggle. Pay only a 1/3 of what they ask. No more!Tips: Not necessary but always welcomed. I found service was the same whether or not you tipped. Gifts for maid and staff is always appreciated but don't bring dollar store stuff - that crap is just as cheap there as here and it's all garbage. Give $$ instead of personal hygene or gift items. Just my thought...This resort is rated a 4* and I concur. Have fun!!Note: The TPR is sister resort to two other surrounding resorts. The Grand Caribe and Punta Cana Princess. Everyone shares all! Beach, restaurants, etc... however, you do have better options at the no-charge al carte restaurants if you stay at the other two resorts. ',GOOD,
'Great Last Minute Holiday We travelled to Punta Cana March 11 to 18th 2006 for the Ontario March Break and stayed at the Tropical Princess / Carib Club Princess. We are 3 adults in their 30s with much travel experience in the Caribbean and with all inclusive resorts. Keep in mind we booked this holiday 3 weeks prior to departure so there was not much to choose from. We were a little concerned that there was so little reviews on the Tropical Princess but upon arrival we discovered why. The Tropical Princess / Carib Club Princess are the same complex that share same facilities. The only difference in the 2 鈥渉otels鈥?is the type of room you receive and where it is in the complex. So if you are looking for Tropical reviews, read also the Carib Club reviews. Furthermore the Punta Cana Princess is in the same complex, a 2 minute walk away. They have their own restaurants but shared in our trolley service, spa, etc. ( a side note I visited the Punta Cana Princess on walks daily and once at night and it is far more quiet, sedate, and smaller than the Tropical and Carib) Our flight to Punta Cana was uneventful. The drive to the hotel was an hour despite the guides saying 20 min. from airport as they stopped at 5 hotels before ours.The lobby at the Tropical/Carib is nice. The interesting concept of this resort is the lobby/nightly entertainment/disco/shops/internet/guide tours/theatre are nowhere near the rooms. In fact you have to take a trolley from the above places or walk about 7 minutes to the complex where the room buildings/restaurants/pools are. This has pros and cons. On the one hand the area between the two areas is beautifully manicured/gardened almost with a 鈥榬ainforest鈥?theme which makes for a wonderful stroll. However there are times when you need to be at the above places i.e. lobby to complain or pick up things or when it is raining that the distance is a pain. Further the trolley is on Dominican time and there are times when the wait is much longer than the 15 min. they promise. If you book at the Tropical 鈥?pay for the VIP program once you arrive. Don鈥檛 give your North American travel agent the extra commission. We bought it in the lobby upon arrival and do not regret it all! It goes into effect the next day after arrival. You get the items listed: 1 bottle rum, cigars, bathrobes, night turn down service, premium liquor (Absolut/Bacardi) 1 hour internet service, but most importantly you get a free dinner at La Cava and a free 25 minute massage in the spa!!! Well worth the $90 we spent. All the restaurants are included except La Cava and El S鈥?La Cava is $25 per person for Carib Club and $50 per person for Tropical guests. With the VIP bracelet, you get there for free and the lobster and steak dinner was definitely worth it! Further we all used the spa 2 more times after our free massage as it was at par with most North American spas. Prices were reasonable. Food: For the most part, the dinners at the specialty restaurants are good. We ate at all of them and were impressed with presentation and choices. Service was slow at most of them but what can you expect? The buffet restaurant was frustrating at breakfast and lunch. You can鈥檛 get your own pop/water/coffee so have to constantly be flagging down waiters even though the machines are accessible. Further they usually only have 1 cook for most popular items: omelets, crepes, meat, pasta etc. which generated lineups making most food warm or even cold by time you reach your table. We felt the food at the buffet was mediocre at best when compared to other resorts in Dominican and elsewhere. Where was the fresh orange juice? It was concentrated. Rooms: On arrival our door lock was broken and we refused to stay in room until it was fixed. Looked like a forced entry had been done. It was around 10:45 p.m. We got the 鈥渄on鈥檛 worry, no problem鈥?line that they would take care of it tomorrow. No way. Not with reports of thefts etc. on previous reviews plus our concerns for our own security. We had also requested a room not on the first floor which it was. Since it was Sat. night there were no other rooms available so we couldn鈥檛 leave our room for drinks etc. and had room service. They did temporarily fix it by 1:30 a.m. and promised us a new room on 2nd floor next day. This did happen by 3:00 p.m. next day and we were happy with our new room. Most rooms in the Tropical are Suites 鈥?2 rooms and 2 bathrooms. Perfect for stretching out. Our maid service was not the greatest at all despite leaving many gifts and cash but didn鈥檛 feel like complaining about it as yes, you are rarely in room anyway. Resort: We have been to countless resorts in Caribbean so have much to compare to. We swear people at this resort stayed up all night or get up at 5:00 to reserve beach chairs. This was very frustrating as we are sun-worshippers and were on the beach by 7:30 every single day and never once got seats that we wanted but further back under huts. We know pools were easier but we are not pool people. These resorts need to get more chairs to met demand, it baffles me that this is an issue at most resorts despite people complaining. There were constant chair stealers we saw and battles. Its not worth it. Invest in as many chairs as you have guests. Logic? A majority of the guests were French from France. They had their own French entertainment staff that combined with the Dominican staff who were generally Spanish only with some French and little English made interactions with the English speaking guests fairly limited. We were blatantly ignored most of the time when they were scouring the beach / pool for people for activities. It was only on the 3rd day when we realized that the guests had different wristband colours. All guests who were French had blue so staff would know the French. VIP was orange and everybody else was grey. Interesting dynamics to watch. Overall: We did not have one daylight hour of rain and clouds were minimal so how can one complain too much about a holiday? We knew going in that this was a last minute holiday at a 4* resort in Dominican. So with the exception of the broken door, mediocre food at lunch, and generally being ignored by the staff, we had a great holiday with good times in our group and the people we met. Would we go back? Almost definitely not, but that is because we never return to the same resort as we like new experiences in new places. Would we recommend Tropical/Carib? With some reservations of what to expect, to definitely buy the VIP plan, and to request a Carib room or a Tropical suite.Beach itself is beautiful and you can鈥檛 go wrong with that. ',POOR,
'Loved it!!!! My boyfriend and i stayed at the tropical princess from December 2-9th, 2005. We absolutely loved it there. The beach was amazing, pools were great, room was clean, food was good, staff was incredibly friendly and the animation at the nightly shows was entertaining!!! The only complaint that i had was, there was'nt really anything to do between 7-9PM, as the shows started at 9Pm daily. Other than that it was awsome, wish we would have stayed for 14 days.If you are visiting Punta Cana, i would highly recommend going on the Marinarium Adventure, where you go snorkelling with sharks. A little scary at first but amazing when you get in the water. Definately a memory i will never forget.Another excursion to try is the Bavaro trackers, this one was an ATV ride, about 1.5 hours through the beach of Punta Cana ,where you get to see Julio Iglesia's Beach Home followed by a 30 minute horseback riding trip. ( Do not buy the video tape that they try to sell you of your excursion, the quality is horrible).The tropical princess is great for families, and couples, not alot to do if you are single!!!The hotel is dominated by europeans, not alot of canadians or americans.Check IN: Quick and easy, probably because we got to the resort around 9PM!!! Staff was helpful though!! But it is up to you to figure out where everything is at the resort by just using a small map.( kinda sucks, when its dark out and you have no clue what part of teh resort you are in)Food: was good, not great. I would recommend bringing some stomach medication. After about the 4th day, my stomach was accustomed to the food. But overall is was good, there were different themes every night. Definatley go to the Dominican theme night dinner, staff is dressed is dominican outfits, and the buffett is decorated in Dominican colors and fabrics. (Beautiful)Beach: Waves at the Tropical beach are higher than any other resort, however is is great for boogie boarding. ( So much Fun!!!)Staff: Awsome, especially CARLOS, on of the animation staff!!! They work so hard for so little money and seem to be enjoying every minute of it.Rooms: Clean and big enough for the time that you spend in your room anyways. Maids sometimes would'nt clean the room until 3pm, but that didnt bother us because they were cleaned by the end of the day anyways.Pools: There were 3 all together. The one with the swim-up bar was the most lively. The staff would do dance lessons, aerobics, volleyball, and play great spanish music there all day. If you want to sit by the pool to read a book and enjoy the sun, the other two pools were less busy.Check Out: If i can offer any advise it would be to buy a phone card before you go. Very Expensive if you want to make a phone call!!!Check out time is 12PM, so if your flight leaves later in the day, you have to keep your luggage in the lobbby, or pay extra for every hour you want to keep your room. However we left our stuff in the lobby and everything was fine.I loved the tropical princess and would go back in a heartbeat!!!! ',GOOD,
'Tropical princess- resort 3.5* We have just returned from a week at the TROPICAL PRINCESS. The RESORT hotel is magnificent with beautiful trees, beach and flowers.There is still the season of wind so we can only use Catamaran and Kayak for 2 days out of 7 days. Avoid months Jan,Feb car a lot of wind.The resort is very clean. The room is small even that we had a small suite with partial ocean view (2adults and 2 children ).Room is very standard *3*). We took VIP option (15$/person adult/day) which is really great so we can go to all restos a la carte and many options such as massage, motorised banana float...). The food is just normal even a la carte restos (chinese,italian,mexican,sea food,domnican,french ).We loved the room service 24H, the snack is good when you order from the room.The evening shows are great(Lion King,...).If you do care about having a luxurous room and excellent food then may be choose for a 5* resort car this resort has a very standard room, food is normal. Three of us were sick by eating food.Be careful for the bagages when check out. There are no system for labels or numbers assigned to each person so bagages can be mixed up anywhere.People are very nice in this resort. Service is good. It was sunny everyday 28C. ',POOR,
'beautiful resort but the food is lacking We went with our three children (7,1013). It was great for the kids. Lots to do. We had taken some junk food as recommended on this site. The food really was not very good. Two of us were sick and are still not feeling great at home. If we were to go again, we'd take a small suit case of healthy snacks. Probably wouldn't go here again because of the food. The beach was awesome. We did have one cockroach in our room. Saw him on the first day and a few times after. They're very fast - we never did get him. The resort was very clean, not overly big (which we liked. We left at 1 am on the last day and had to check out at noon. We were promised a courtesy room to shower but never did get one. They had assigned the same room to more than one couple. We saw two couples arguing over another room for which they had done the same thing - assigned one room twice. Not the end of the world but they really didn't even seem to care. No Sorry for the inconvenience. Just there are no rooms - we're very full. ',POOR,
'Tropical Princess - great beach! The beach at this resort was fantastic -- beautiful white, powdery sand. Very small resort, which was nice. It is quiet. Entertainment is available at the other three resorts, which you have access to. The grounds at this hotel are impeccable. Restaurants were great. It is rated a 5 or 4 and half in the brochures. We would call it a 4. Only because of other hotels where the VIP service is included and that makes them a 5. We would definitely recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Best time EVER !!!!!! The resort was amazing, beautiful grounds, great rooms, wicked pools and the beach was the best ever. You can not go wrong staying at this resort. The only problem was the lack of putters for minature golf. You sign them out and sadly some people just kept them in their rooms leaving others without. It that was our biggest problem, life is good. If you like ketchup you might want to take a small bottle with you. We decided to take a cab to the resort which turned out great. For $25.00 we got there first and checked in before the crowd. We also took a cab back to the airport so we were able to stay longer and not have to wait at the airport for hours. Don't forget to bring your own insulated travel mugs they are perfect, they will fill them up at the bar, your drink doesn't get cold and you don't waste cups!!!!! If you plan on sun tanning at the beach and want a hut you have to get up by 6 am and reserve the chairs with you beach towels. The breeze at the ocean was lovely and you didn't notice the heat. If you stayed by the pools it was incredibly hot but hey whatever floats your boat. The staff didn't speak much English so I would suggest you learn some key words in Spanish. Another bonus thing we did was bring floating chairs. We would float out to the buoy line hang on for a while then float in with the waves - GOOD TIMES !!!! Some people used them on their chairs for extra cush. The scuba shack filled them up for us then we left them when we came home so someone else could enjoy them. We went to all the a la carte restaurants but highly enjoyed the Brazilian. It was a very cool experience especially if you like meat. A must do for a romantic dinner. If you hear anyone complaining about this resort they are the kind of people that shouldn't travel outside their own home. Hola ',GOOD,

'Fabulous Time at the Tropical Princess!! We got a great deal on a 2 week vacation, and it was awesome. We were there from Jan 21-Feb 4th. I found the deal online, and my travel agent matched it, since I am hesitant to give out info online, I was extremely happy.We did not get into Punta Cana till almost 10pm, and I was unpacking and sipping a cervasa by 11:30. The buffet is open for late night snacks, so my hubby wandered around while I relaxed on the balcony overlooking one of the pools. Our room was great--we had 2 bathrooms! One full, one with a shower, sink and toilet. We had a King size bed, a real one, not 2 twins pushed together! No problems with the air, water pressure, locks or hydro and there was only one day that we did not have hot water, it was about 2pm, and by 5pm it was running hot again. I have heard they shut it off during the day to preserve it, and while I can't confirm it, it does make sense. There is a staff member in the lobby of the buildings every morning between 9:30 and 11:30 to make your a la carte reservations and to answer any questions you may have. There are 3 buildings with 3 floors on them, and they are for guests of both the Tropical and Caribe.The weather was great the whole two weeks, and yes, the beach was a bit windy, which I thought was great--lots of fun jumping and playing in the waves, and for some strange reason the wind seemed to cut the power of the sun,,we could lay out much longer when it was windy! The grounds were very well kept, and everyone was always busy painting, raking, sweeping,==felt a bit guilty for just lounging around as they worked so hard!The food was fine, always something to eat at the buffet at supper, certainly did not starve. The Crepery was great for a light snack after a hard day tanning and swimming~for lunch we usually went to the bar on the beach for a light snack, but be sure to ask them to cook the beef patties from the steam table, we had a few that were pink, and the cook had no problems grilling them a bit longer for us. I do suggest you watch for a fresh batch of fries, as they tend to get cold pretty quick!I really have no complaints at all,,yes, you have to be out of your room by noon, but along with the option of paying extra for longer, you can also choose to just get a courtesy room for a shower--thats what I did, and it worked out just fine. It also gave me the chance to see another room, this one was much smaller then ours, with only one bathroom. As mentioned in the forum, I did have some issues with some non North Americans and their total lack of manners, but I have found that on all of our vacations, and by no means is it limited to this resort.We did not see any of the shows, or go to any of the specialty restaurants, so I can't comment on them, but I did hear great things about the shows from other guestsPlease take my suggestion to bring snacks from home seriously-we paid $9 for a can of Pringles. (We really wanted them!!!!!)I may not choose a Sunwing vacation again,our flight was delayed and the rep only let us know after the bus did not show up, and did not come and tell us, rather some of the other Sunwing guests had to fill us in. I felt he could have made more of an effort to keep all of us informed. When he finally found out a flight time and a time the bus would be coming, he posted a sign and left quickly. I did not go to the meeting to hear about the excursions because I had no intention of going on one, but once I went up to find the binder that contained the departure time for the bus and could not find it, I regretted that decision--finally found it on our 10th day,,thankfully, since there was no info posted on the board either. Please note on the package they gave us on the bus said we had to attend to reconfirm your flight --that is not true, and I felt bad for the people who went only to find that out. Again, nothing to do with the resort.We would certainly return to this resort, and will recommend it to our friends.My Hubby wanted me to mention that even though there is a Sports Channel on T.V they did not show any hockey games at all for the entire 2 weeks:( ',GOOD,
'Beautiful grounds with wonderful beach ! My wife and I booked the VIP package to the Tropical Princess for the week of Jan 22 nd . For the additional $ 100 / pp you received an upgrade to an ocean view room in the Caribe Club Princess , 3 cigars , small bottle of rum , extra set of beach towels , 2 housecoats and slippers , 1/2 hour of free internet pp ( $ 5 US per 1/2 hr ) , room service , 20 minute massage ( $ 20 / pp ) , banana boat ride ( $ 30 / pp ), superior liquor , ( american  dominican bottled beer and name brand liqueurs )use of all regular la carte restaurants and choice between the Pescador and La Cava . The other restaurant was available for an additional charge of $ 31 US / pp . The safe cost $ 25 US for the week and the mini fridge was stocked with pop and water , no beer . ( the bar staff always gave us the twist caps with our bottled beer ) We ate breakfast and lunch at the buffet and were very happy with the service , selections and quality of food . There was also a creperie / ice cream restaurant and 2 beach restaurants available for lunch . The later turned into the Brazilian and Pescador a la cartes for dinner . There were also a Chinese / Japanese , Italian , Mexican and Dominican a la carte . We enjoyed all but the Brazilian , but the staff made up for the food . The bar service was hit and miss with 24 hour service at the main buffet restaurant . We were treated very well by the staff at the front desk and check in and out was uneventful . The activity staff and entertainers were typical all inclusive , working an extraordinary amount of hours and always trying to make everybody happy . The grounds are beautiful with large mature palms and a 200 yard walk through a mangrove to get from the lobby to the room , restaurant and beach areas . The beach is whiteish with red specks and goes for miles in each direction . The ocean is a clear greeny blue with days of yellow and red flags . Kayaks and hobie cats are free but have to be booked in advance from a private company that also has the dive shop . We have travelled the busier north coast of the Dominican from Monte Christi to Puerta Plata to San Juan to the Samana peninsula and comparing , find the Punta Cana / Bavaro area to be more for kicking back and relaxing . Santo Domingo , 3 1/2 hours away , is the capitol and the place to go to purchase rum and cigars . About 70 % of the cigars sold in the Domincan , including anything sold for under $ 100 US a box , are actually banana leaves . To determine if cigars are good , waste one and give it the snap test . When a cigar is bent in half it should snap in two , if it crumbles it is banana leaf . To detemine if your larimar is authentic simply put a match or lighter to it and hope it doesn't melt . Real amber will sink in a glass of salt water , synthetic will float . Remember some airlines do not permit the transfer of 151 proof rum as it is flammable . Faceclothes are non existent in the Dominican , so take your own . If you forget any of the many personal staples you will require while at this resort you will pay through the nose at the complex's store . The Bavaro area is a right turn and a 1/2 hr walk down the beach , 20 minutes out the front gate or a $ 6 cab ride . When the bank machine at the resort is not working there is a casino with a bank machine on the outside of the building about a 15 minute walk towards town . It did not charge me a service fee and gave me 29 pesos per $ CAN . The hotel offers 23 pesos however if you have a bill at the end of your stay make sure you use your credit card as they convert the $ US at 30 pesos , a 10 % savings . We would definitely return to this resort but probably not in January as it is extremely windy until mid February . ',GOOD,

'Great, I would go back I was at the Tropical for a week. Despite minor difficulties at the arrival (key for room not working) my stay was great and I would go back again! I am a difficult person in terms of food and I can say that it was average but you can always found something to eat. The breakfast was very good and a lot of fruits which I enjoyed very much. The personnel is nice and the service nothing to complain about.The beach is great and the pool as well (a bit cold). The room was super clean. Anyway, did not regret my choice and I will go back again. So Enjoy. ',GOOD,

'Had a wonderful time Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids spent Christmas week at the Tropical Princess. Overall, the experience was very positive.Property: Very lush and well maintained. The lobby is a 10-minute walk from all the hotel rooms. We always enjoyed the walk especially after eating all that food. We never took the trolley except during check-in and out.Swimming pools: There are three. All have zero entrance and beautifully designed. We usually go to the one close to our villa since it is more secluded and less crowded.Beach: Bavero beach is very pretty. It is a bit wavy. The sand is very fine, a bit of seaweeds, no rocks anywhere. There are lots of beach chairs and huts. People do go early in the morning to leave a towel there to reserve a hut.Food: We ate mostly at the buffet which offered good variety with lots of seafood. The new year's eve feast was excellent. We also ate at the 2 restaurants which were included, the food was OK, but if you miss them, no big deal. For lunch, the beach grill has excellent BBQ's, not to be missed.Staff: All very friendly, most of them speak or understand very little English. We don't speak a word of Spanish but we managed OK.Accommodations: It's not the Ritz but the room was clean with average maid service. There were lots of mosquitoes every night we were in our room. We came well prepared with repellents, mosquito coils and an electric mosquito Zapper(looks like a tennis racket), that weapon worked like a charm and killed the bug everytime. We had to do a full house extermination before bedtime each night.Excursions: We did a sunset horse-back riding on the beach. The riding was one and a half hour except the guy did not tell use that it takes one hour to get there, so altogether it was more like three and a half hours. The ride back was scary since it was after sunset and the driver was going very fast.Complaints: Nothing major. They did not have enough locks for the in-room safe. I had to visit the lobby many times before I finally got one. There is a $20 rental charge for the lock, what a rip-off, the $20 is more than enough to buy the lock and yet they are running out of locks.Conclusions: It's been one week since we came back and we still haven't removed our resort ID wristband. We are already talking about going back for our next trip. ',GOOD,
'Lots of hype and hot air We got back form the Tropical Princess on the 18 of Dec. and I am sorry to say that we read all the reviews on this resort before we went with it and find it hard to believe that so many people fine this such a great place. Yes the beach is nice and the ocean is warm but the beach has about 60 other resorts on it, so you can't say this is a great thing about staying at the Tropical Princess when 59 other resorts offer the same thing. The rooms were plain but ok, the mini-fridge would leak water on to the floor making a small pool and the potential for a slip and fall. Every Once in a while the hot water would stop working and you would have to wait about an hour or so before you could take a shower and then the water temp. was just above cool at best. The A/C vent would give off a musty smell when just starting up, which was because the past guest in the room was a smoker which accounts for about 70% of the people at this resort, mostly Europeans. The staff was not as friendly as everyone had said most of them would just ignore you if you could not speak the language, mostly the bar staff. The food in the buffey was terrible, with most of it looking like it was re-used from the last meal, this is were I thing most people are getting sick from, us included. The front lobby is about a good 10 min. walk to the rooms which is divided by a big smelly swamp were most of the mosquitos come from and the shuttle cars are never around when you need a lift or they are going the wrong way. The pools look nice but don't be fooled,they don't clean them as offend as they should which leaves bites of plant matter and floating bugs on the top of the water, after swimming in the pool about 3 times I started to get bad earaches which went away when I stop putting my head under water while swimming, stick with swimming in the ocean. Check in is at 3 pm  check out is 12 noon, remember this if booking a trip here because we had a 6:30 pm pick up in the lobby,this would leave us with no room for 6 1/2 hours.But you can extend your room for about 10.00US per hour. We went that route because we had our 7 year old with us and it cost us about $80.00 Canadian for about 5 hours more, what a burn. Lots of the kids at this resort were looking ill, probably from the food and it was hard to stand by and see this and the parents did'nt look very happy as well. All in all I would have to give this resort a 4 out of 10 and we would not return to this resort again. ',POOR,
'15 days at the Princess We just got back from the Punta Cana princess,(Caribe Club side) a few days ago...The check in was non-eventful, they do not let you have your room until 3:00, so we had to wait about 5 hrs. until our room was ready. When our room was good to go, we found it on our own. We had to call the front desk/bell boys 4 times to bring our 1 peice of luggage, but after waiting an hour, and 4 different people saying it would be '10 minutes', my husband went to the lobby and transported it back.The rooms were clean and basic. Nothing too fancy, and the toiletries offered are not of high quality, mostly the conditioner. Despite tipping, every day the room was not stocked properly, sometimes they would forget water, towels or extra TP. There was also no remote for the TV. With all the marble flooring and open air architecture, noises travelled easily, and my husband and I would sleep with earplugs every night. There seems to be a lack of signs to let people know what is what, so we spent the first few hours just checking things out and learning where things are. Despite these minor things, we were always comfortable and never that burdened.The pools were beautiful, the grounds were even more so. The beach was amazing, very relaxing, clean, and always a palapa. The water was so warm and a perfect turqouise and sand was powdery white. 10 out of 10.The Staff were amazing, mostly the bartenders (Juaquin, Eduardo) and the animation Staff. All VERY hard working for very little pay. We brought $200.00 US$ just for tips, and wish we brought more. The gardeners work very hard 'cutting the lawn' by HAND on their knees in the heat. They are all so grateful for a dollar here and there. So tip big. They really deserve it.The food was good, mostly at the BBQ by the beach bar. My husband and I both got sick 3 times each...hard to say what from though..We went to the Marinarium on our excursion. It was a great time to snorkel and swim with the sharks. A really fun day with an awesome animation team. I would definetely recommend it.Internet use in the lobby was $5.00 US for 30 mins. It was a fast connection and worked fine.All in all, we had a wonderful holiday, thanks to all the natural beauty that surrounded the resort and all the amazing hard working Staff.Any questions, you can email me.

'Tropical Princess - A unique Review. I've read all the reviews on this site about the TP and rather than spewing the usual things I'll try to give a unique perspective. I'm a little more on the painfully honest and sceptical side of things. Check IN:was fine, what you'd hope for in a resort, many people working the desk and it seemd to flow easily enough. Few people we met in the VIP suites had to wait a couple hours but that's to be expected periodically. Don't bother thinking you don't need the bellboys for the luggage. Resort is large and lugging your crap around is a hassle. If you're on the cheap side be prepared to tip here... Rooms: Nice enough, nothin super fancy. If in the TP side be prepared for to hear all the giggles or CNN from the room next door when rooms are ajoining. We were there initially but after a little sweet talkin were bumped to the CP. Basically the same resort when you walk through it, the CP is just a little better side. *Heres a note tho.. make sure to properly check your sliding glass doors. The newer room's lock didnt work properly, a quick tug felt like it was locked but any real PULL and it popped open. Because our new room was on a more secluded side of the resort my paranoid side kicked in. Everyday I wedged the coffee table in the door to block the slide action (GF has learned to trust my instincts so barely peeped up). Second last day I went out on the balcony and realized the door was off its tracks, and they aren't light doors so doubt the maid nudged it off. Just be aware of things and unlike me (cheapie cheapie) get the safe for peace of mind. Pools: Nothing worth commenting on....Beach: was sweet as discussed elsewhere. Not sure what the other people were Boogy boarding on but dont count that as a highlight. Late august the waves are minimal, be prepard to float a foot or two and return them in 10 mins. Restaurants: the dominican was decent, brazilian id skip.. heard and experienced mixed results with the other ones so i think its a crap shoot. You can only eat the buffet so many times so go try them with an open mind. Entertainment: personally I could care less about the shows on resorts, they always seemd busy and didnt hear many complaints. Frankly if your under 50 im sure you'll be here n there with them.  Wierdly enough unlike cuba (which I've visited twice in past 18 months) there is an atmosphere of criminality in punta cana, nothing against TP at all. Be like blameing the Hilton for crime in New York City but it does seem a little more slimey if you catch my drift.There are many tips i can give but will save them for various reasons. If you'd like to know anything feel free to contact me and I'd be happy to help as much as i can. Some will save you hassels and money.. be prepared for me to ask a favour tho... ;O) ** I meant to get a medicinal herb they sell there in abundance for my neighbour (goin thorugh Kemo, every bar and store has it) but i forgot it in the hotel when i left. No problems bringing to Canada I just rushed out and was absent minded. I'd be happy to pay double what it costs you (4$US) just to help the guy out and will come to you in the Toronto or suburbs. I tried it myself and am a firm believer in the healing properties. Please help... However, know the favour isnt manditory Id be happy to help anyway I can.All the best.robbienorth@hotmail.com ',GOOD,

'Loved our stay at the Tropical Princess My sister and I stayed at the Tropical Princess from July 31st to August 13th and really enjoyed it. The room was clean and cool (once we had understood how it worked!!!), the food was o.k. (better than in Cuba) and the sun was there through our entire vacation. Though it's true that you have to get up early to have a cabana at the beach (I was there every morning at 7:00 to reserve a chair, but I was always up by 6:30. if you try to get a cabana later than 8:00, forget it!!!), you can always find a place at 1 of the 3 pools and since it is near the beach you can easily walk. The resort is very well kept (gardens, grass and path) and clean (including the beach, no seaweeds, no empty cans or plastic glasses). For people having trouble walking or with young children, note that there is a bus that drives around the resort.By reading the reviews before we decided on the Tropical Princess I was a little hesitant, but now that I'm back, I would say that I find that a lot of travellers expect too much. Don't forget that you are in the Dominican Republic and that things are different. Be patient (the notion of time is different in the DR) and please don't expect that everybody speaks english. Getting to know another culture is part of the fun of travelling!!!! ',GOOD,
'Very Relaxing Vacation Just came back from the tropical princess. We were there from August 7 to August 14th. I travel frequently to Cuba and the Dominican Rebublic and I have to say that the Domincan Rebublic is by far the better place to travel to. Check in: Check in took a little while only becuase they had two full buses which arrived at the same time. The front desk staff are extremely friendly and go out of there way to assist you.Rooms: Our room was spacious and was EXTREMELY CLEAN. There was absolutely no smell to our room. We were in building 5238. Ask to stay in the quiet side of the reort, you won't be disapointed.Food: The food was descent. You could always find something to eat. We went to two ala cartes which were the chinesse and mexican. Both of these were fantastic.Staff: the staff overall were extremely friendly even if you don't tip. FYI make sure you bring down little gifts. I went to the dollar store before I went down and brought deodorants, shampoo candy perfume and cologne. They absolutley LOVED it. They appreciate gifts more than money.Overall I really enjoyed this vacation. In january I stayed at Brisas Guardalavaca in Hoguin Cuba which was an absolute NIGHTMARE. This by far is one of my best vacations. If you have any questions please feel free to e-mail me at cbascombetrack@hotmail.com. ',GOOD,
'Great Vacation!!! My husband and I have just returned from our all-inclusive trip to the Tropical Princess Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Like many of you, I looked through the reviews on this website before I booked my vacation, and I was very happy I did. To make it easy and simple, I've included my reviews under different categoried....hope this helps!!!Hotel Room:Our room was nice and clean. Like many of you, I'm picky when it comes to cleanliness, and I have to say that the room was beautiful. We had a king size bed, a long dresser with mirror, and a full bathroom. The room was also equipped with a mini fridge that had coke, sprite and a big jug of water. The only negative thing was that they didn't have a remote control. We were told that if we went to the lobby, we could give a $5 deposit and get one there. However, we tried and tried, but they kept telling us that there were no batteries. We gave up after the 2nd day there. Also, the room was nice and cool because the air conditioner worked great and we were able to keep it at the temperature that we liked/Food:If you are looking to eat american food than this is not the place to go. Just remember that you are in another country and so the food there is completely different. There were many A la Carte restaurants to choose from but we mostly ate at the Main Buffet Restaurant. If you're a coffee drinker like us, you will not be happy because it was as thick as mud and even after adding tones of cream, it still was black. Nevertheless, they had lots of drinks to choose from like juices, tea, pop, and of course alcohol. Like almost every resort, they are cheap with the alcoholic drinks. Sometimes they had lots of alcohol but sometimes it tastes like there's nothing in it. Once again, the food was ok. I ate lots of pasta, salad, bread, ice cream, french fries, and lots of fresh fruit because most of the food was stuff that I usually don't eat like rabbit, fish, cooked bananas, octopus, ect..Don't be afraid of getting sick because neither of us got sick during our vacation. Just stick to the food that you know is good.Pools:There were 3 huge pools at the resort and they were absolutely beautiful. There was lots of room to swim and they were never crowded. In regards to beach chairs, that's another subject. Like other reviews of resorts, there are LOTS of people who throw towels on the chairs first thing in the morning and don't even show up until late afternoon. I found iit to be very annoying and ignorant. We were usually down at the pool at 10:00 and we always found a lounge chair by the pool and in the shade.Beach and Gardens:I have to say that these were my 2 favourite things at the resort. They absolutely stunning and what I'd hoped they'd look like. The resort was filled with beautiful gardens, flowers and palm trees. The beach was gorgeous with its white sand and blue water.Shopping:All I can say about this is BARGAIN...BARGAIN....BARGAIN.!!!! The gift shop at the resort has set prices in US dollars. Make sure to bring everything you need with you like sunscreen, aloe gel, and snacks because you don't want to have to buy anything there. Here's a few example: They charged 2 dollars US for a chocolate bar, 7 dollars US for a big bag of chips, 22 dollars US for a little bottle of aloe vera gel, over 20 dollars US for sunscreen. They definitely like tourists!!!! As for souvenir shopping, there is Bavaro Plaza whcih is about 10 minutes from the resort. You can use a bike or take a taxi. We also found a little market on the beach. If you're facing the ocean, walk to your left down the beach for about 10 minutes and you'll find about 20 little huts set up with souvenirs. Once again, bargain with them. We got 2 big bottles of rum for $17 US dollars, and the gift shop at the resort was charging $18 US for one bottle. Great overall vacation.....Hope this helps!!!! ',GOOD,
'When do I leave to go back there !!! I went there the week of June 12th to the 19th with one of my girl friends. We went there to relax and we did.... The rooms are clean, the food is wonderful and the BEACH...WOW !!!! We could walk for miles on the white sanded beach. A few guests complained of the chairs on the beach and about the face cloths that were missing. On the first day, we asked our maid to bring us some and we had clean face cloths every day. As for the chairs, I guess it all depends on the time that you go to the beach... We stayed at our pool until about 1:00pm and we had no problems finding chairs at that time. The shows at night are the best I've seen so far. They are worth staying up for. My only complaint about this resort is the lack of bars... There was bars with every pools but they were all closed except for one which was the swim-up bar. I guess it's okay but for us, it represented a 7 minute walk to get a drink. The mini-bar from our room really came in handy. There was water, Coke and Sprite. The bottle opener by the way is on the back of the fridge door !!! Just a tip, use sunscreen, the sun is very HOT !!! Also, if you want to buy souvenirs, maybe a ride to the mall outside the resort would be a good idea. Let's just say that we were very impressed by this resort. Good food, confortable beds, beautiful beach, great entertainment and wonderful weather !!!!! It will be very hard to beat !!! ',GOOD,
'Great Time, but.. We were there the week of June 6 2005 and had a fantastic stay. Here are some pointers to make yours even better:- take face cloths (if you use them)as there will be none in your room- the doors have no bottom sill so insects can crawl under easily so put a towel along the bottom of your door on the inside. We had absolutely no problem with insects.- bring your own beach towels. Yes, they provide them at the beach butyou will need more than one towel to cover the blue and white chairs.- the outside blue and white chairs are in excellent shape; the best I've seen at a resort.- ask for remote control for the TV when you check in. They want $20 if you don't return it.- if you buy internet access in the main lobby, watch your start time. Its $5 for 30 minutes but the guy will try to kick you off early ; even if no-one is waiting.- look for a bartender called Victoriano. He's very hard-working and anxious to please. - take battieries, film, sunburn ointments or any other pharmaceuticals that you think you might need. The resort mini-mart will charge you $22 US for a sunburn ointment you can get at home for $5. But you'll pay the $22 because you are really sore, right?- take $ US and don't bother with pesos. Stores off the resort will give you a better price for $ US. Avoid using a credit card. They will charge you in pesos and then charge you 4-6 % extra for using the card!- take some snacks for the late evening if you are visiting during the off-season.- again, take $ US even if you have medical coverage. We ran into a Scottish guy at the Occidental Grand Flamenco whose son needed dental work. All services were cash only upfront and he was scrambling to find bank machines to pay the hundreds of US dollars they wanted. - our toilet seat was broken. After maintenance requests to the front desk; nothing happened. I gave the chambermaid $5 US and a card with our room number and Spanish description of the problem. The toilet seat was fixed within hours!- stay out of the pools after 7PM daily as they are treated then. - take a bottle opener. Free pop in the room is great but there was no opener.- the timeshare touters on the beach can be avoided with a big smile, a wave and repeating 'No thanks!. Be friendly. Its their living.Thats it. Have a great time! ',GOOD,
'Very Relaxing My husband and I were joined by our children, 14, 17, 22. It was a lovely vacation and the best beach that I have ever been to!! The buffet was incredible, they had 15 or 16 different stations. We arrived at 11 pm and there was lots of food and drinks for us so you don't need to worry about not having a supper on the plane. The buffet was open 24hours!! There was nightly entertainment in two different locations, one by the buffet and the other at the main entry. There were five different restaurants and three pools. We did however have to get up around 6 am to reserve beach chairs under palapas. However, if you didn't get up there were chairs to be found in the sun. We had beautiful suites with two bathrooms that were cleaned everyday. The staff was very friendly and if you tiped they were that much better. Bring hats to give away, you will make great friends and get incredible service from staff if you acknowledge them. In all it was very relaxing and we won't forget this holiday. Oh and don't forget your sunscreen and mosquito repellent for the black flies at night, that you don't see till the next day. Have fun and enjoy the beach ',GOOD,
'Very nice but I hope you don't want a chair at the beach We have travelled many times before to the Carribean and knew what to expect. The food was very good. You must remember it is not Canadian food. There was something at the buffet for guests from all over the world so of course there are many things we passed right on by. For example one night there was a delicious hip of beef with all the trimmings. We went to the Dominican a la carte restaurant but were not overly impressed. The service was fine throughout the resort but what is our personal pet peeve when travelling is a resort that does not have enough lounge chairs at the beach. You had to be up before 6 a.m. to get a chair. People would go down and put their towel on the chair and not come to the beach til after lunch. I was surprised to see this at a 4+ star resort. We saw chairs vacant for 4-5 hours straight. Extremely rude guests. We have been away many times and always meet people from all over. This resort however had mostly French guests and we are strictly English speaking. We did meet an American couple the second to last day there and they observed the same. The attitude of the guests is something you can not hold against the hotel however they promote French guests by employing French students brought from a university in France to deal exclusively with the French guests. I have nothing against French people just only wanted to make a point that the language barrier made it difficult to meet people. The resort itself was very clean and the entertainment deserves top marks. ',GOOD,
'Fabulous vacation at the Tropical Princess Tropical Princess Resort  Spa (4*) 鈥?Punta Cana, Dominican RepublicFrom Vancouver, CanadaMy husband and I stayed at this resort from March 10 鈥?17th, 2005. My criteria in looking for a resort was that it had to be 4* or plus and be a newer location. This resort was built in 2000. We had paid an extra $80 each to have the VIP package and it was definitely worth it. It gives you added services such as: 20 minute massage, top shelf liquor (i.e. Johnny Walker Black, Remy Martin, Courvosier etc鈥?, motorized sport, free cigars and rum in your room, free pop in your mini bar and free dinner at La Cava (steakhouse) or El Pescador (seafood). Without the VIP package, you would have to pay $25 USD per person to eat at one of these restaurants. First off, I will say that the vacation was fabulous 鈥?the beach and water were beautiful, the staff were friendly and the service was impeccable, the resort had a lot of activities you could choose to join (i.e. baci, archery, fitness classes on the stepper or aquatic classes, dance lessons, miniature golf etc鈥?. For food, there are ample places to eat to suit the pickiest of eaters. The main buffet (El Higuero) had an international buffet, local food, assorted fruits, cheeses and desserts. There were a couple of grills where they would make: fish, chicken etc. There is also a pasta station where you choose the pasta and sauce and the cook heats it up for you in a pan on the spot. If you don鈥檛 want to eat at the buffet for lunch, you can eat at smaller buffets on the resort, or we liked the Grill on the beach. They grilled chicken, burgers and hot dogs. You can find french fries in probably all the restaurants. To eat at one of the a la carte restaurants (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Brazilian, Dominican) you have to book ahead at Guest Services in your building. There is a limit on the number of times you can eat at the a la carte restaurants; my favorite was El Pescador 鈥?get the lobster; it鈥檚 huge! There is also a creperie on site. They serve sweet and salty crepes (i.e. with lobster or salmon etc.) 鈥?I liked the sweet crepes better. The creperie is also the place to go for ice cream or banana splits. The resort has 2 swimming pools (one with a swim up bar) and a hot tub. It was way too hot to use the hot tub although I did see people try it out. As probably indicated in your vacation literature, tips are not required because it is supposed to be included in what you already paid, but you can鈥檛 help but want to give something (not all the time) to those that go above and beyond their duties. I also brought along a couple of Clinique makeup kits filled with some bonus (sample) items. I gave one to our housekeeping lady on the first day and one to the ladies who gave us our massage. I think that they appreciate anything you give them. You鈥檒l find that the staff will say 鈥渉ola鈥?with a smile all over the resort; not only at the front desk, but with employees everywhere on the resort (i.e. gardener, bellboy etc). The resort is really big, so there is a tram that goes around and picks and drops off people. I believe it runs 24 hours a day. You only have to wait for about 10 minutes. One of our favorite places to go everyday was the lobby. It was so comfortable with the wicker cushioned couches. We would get our drinks from the lobby bar and sit on the couch looking at the palm trees with the breeze coming in. There are even people who come around from the lobby bar to take your drink order so that you don鈥檛 have to get up. We bought a couple of things from markets: coffee, souvenirs and larimar. Larimar is a blue semi-precious stone only mined in the Dominican Republic. There are markets to the left (15 min walk) and the right (40 min walk) on the beach. Do not buy anything from the resort stores (convenience market, cigar store, art, jewelry) 鈥?it is overpriced to say the least. For the nightlife, there is a show every night at 9:45 pm. We only dropped in a couple of times, because we would eat dinner late after our drinks. We went to the club twice (free for resort guests) 鈥?good music. There is also a free shuttle to take you to a nearby casino.I don鈥檛 have anything to really complain about. I knew this was a 3rd world country and I lowered my expectations a little. There were only 3 things that could have been better:1)a couple of times, the shower only had cold water (I didn鈥檛 mind, it happens)2)check in was somewhat slow and we had to ask more than once for our VIP privileges (ie. Rum and cigars were not delivered to our room until day 4)3)watch out where your room is; if it is close to the activity area, you will hear loud music from 11 am. It got sort of annoying after awhile with the person on the mic. We got used to it, but if we go back, we may ask to be in another building.Again, these were only minor things and they do not change my mind about this resort. I absolutely recommend it! ',GOOD,
'very nice and Would Recommend To Anyone       beautiful lobby/open airy/marble floors ',GOOD,
'Amazing.. read this if your going there Im 17 and my family of 4 arrived there on march 17. When you get off the plane it was like you were getting hit with a brick wall of heat, therefore go on the plane wearing very VERY light clothing. The airport is pretty amazing all outside but quite busy ( we arrived at night). Getting your luggage and getting on the bus that takes you to your hotel is a little bit hecktic but RELAX, when u get there its so worth it. The roads are very skinny and the drivers sure drive fast but its fun and they do get you there haha. Once again when u arrive at the hotel and checking in its pretty crazy because everyone is frantic to get to their rooms. The rooms are pretty nice but i suggest taking bug spray with dit. I got alot of bits but they were only minor. Make sure you have very extreme sunscreen, i was wearing 50spf but i still managed to burn, bubble and peel. My family adn i went on the Swimming with the sharks/sting rays excurtion. very well worth it. I was pretty timid to go into the pen but it was fine. There is snorkling included in that package. it was about 80 bucks / person. expensive but once again worth it. Parasailing was so awesome too, highly suggested. it is reccomended to take some snacks on the plane with you they didnt feed much, but the chips down there are about 6 bucks for a big bag, kinda ridiuculous.the beaches are absoulty almazing as well. If you have any questiopns e-mail me at --- ',GOOD,
'Awesome Family Vacation We just got back and my family of 4 (kids 5  6 )had a great time. Here is a brief overview.ROOMS: Plenty of variety. Easy to switch if you need to. Don't unpack the first night and have a look around the resort to see where you may want to be. We had a family room:living room w/ 2 days beds plus bedroom with 2 doubles, 2 bathrooms. balcony,tv, mini-fridge. 3rd floor rooms have vaulted ceilings. Others offered sunked livingrooms.FOOD: Pretty good with something for everyone. Brazilian (free)  Italian($8pp/$4kids) are great. Heard Seafood ($25) was good too. Crepes and ice cream avail near beach. Bar/grills offer snacks and lunch by beach.BEACH/POOLS: Best I've ever been to so far. Get up early (before 7am)to reserve your palapas with towels. The pools (3) are great. One for families with little kids, one near beach volleyball and one with bar and lots of action. NIGHT: Lively!!! Party/dancing in looby after evening show. STAFF: Friendly. Although it might not seem like it, but they do work hard all day long. You might think service is slow at times but remember where you are and be a little patient,as it won't kill you to wait a few minutes.GUESTS: We meet lots of really neat people from all over Canada, France, and Germany. If you get involved in something (i.e. beach volleyball) you'll meet people. Speaking French (and spanish) will help you a lot.OTHERS: The resort is beautiful, weather terrific, (did not see a single bug the whole time), well worth the $$$$. Shuttle bus available all day but beautiful and pleasant 5 min walk through man-groves to gorgeous lobby. $20 for safe. Babysitting is $8-$10 per hour but Kids Club free and staff spoke fluent English and French. HINTS: Bring plenty of sunscreen.- price at shop was between $20-$45 for a bottle of sunscreen. Pringles chips were $6, film $10. Bring plenty of small US bills. Change only given in peso. ',GOOD,

'Christmas at Francois 1 We stayed for 3 nights over Christmas 2008  had a very nice time. We had a suite  got it at a very good rate ie less than 50% of the rack rate. It was huge, attractively decorated  very comfortable room. Housekeeping was excellent.The breakfasts were good. Staff were charming  helpful. The bar is lovely  comfortable.Very little to complain about - if you like the Champs Elysee area this hotel will be perfect for you. ',GOOD,
'Pleasant Surprise I can't speak for value for money here as I don't know what the room cost. I ended up here by accident as my reservation at the nearby Kepler fell through when I arrived yesterday due to a guest refusing to vacate the room after his / her flight out had been cancelled as a result of an Air France strike. I was initially furious that the Kepler had moved me rather than the inculmbent, but reading between the lines he / she had refused to move and I guess physical ejection is probably not a viable option. At least not in the 16th. A porter carried my bag the few few hundred metres to the Francois 1er, and I was given a suite on the 1st floor. Now the Kepler is great, but I have to say my disappointment disappeared when I saw the alternative in Francois 1er. It was a proper suite, with a door between the bedroom and sitting room; not just a large room with a sofa at one end. The whole place is beautifully decorated in an up to date classical / trendy style - cream woodwork, two - tone beige wallpaper, beige / black marble bathroom. Every available vertical surface seems to be covered with rows of fake books (even in the lift), which is a bit OTT, but that's a small point. All newish an in good nick, but with just a hint of shabbiness to stop it feeling too artificial. No idea of the cost, but if the rooms are the same value as the breakfast (13鈧? it should be a great option. Location is good, 5 mins from the Arc de Triomphe, but in a very quiet street. In fairness to the Kepler they fetched my bag this morning, I'm writing this in an even bigger suite on their top floor, and they even threw in a chocolate Eifel Tower ! ',GOOD,
'Essence of romantic Paris! From the moment we entered this elegant, small boutique hotel, right around the corner from the Champs Elysee, we were hooked. The hotel offered a quintessential Parisian experience, from the tastefully decorated lobby, to the formal welcome we received from the hotel manager. Our room was very tastefully decorated and larger than I had imagined, based upon the countless reviews of other Parisian hotels. We purchased a package through an online travel website, and not only got a great rate, but breakfast was included in the package. This proved to be a convenience, as cafes in this area of Paris were not open for breakfast, and finding a baguette at 10 in the morning, when catching a metro to Versailles, would have been challenging. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and beautifully served, as the server quickly learned our preferences and was eager to please us. This was European service at it's best. The hotel was a short walk to the Arc de Triumph and all the high scale boutiques on the Champs Elysee. Though the Champs Elysee tends to be very crowded, especially at night, the hotel was an oasis of calm on a quiet side street. We loved Paris, and we loved the Francois Premier! ',GOOD,
'Fantastique!! This boutique hotel is a gem in a city of beauty. A three day weekend with breakfast served until 11 and so quiet that we almost missed it!! and yet, so close to the Champs Elysee that high heels are no impediment to strutting your stuff!! The rooms are small yes, but beautifully and cleverly appointed so that you feel comfortably at home. The breakfast is served to classical music by the charming staff and is typically french, with beautiful pastries, fruits, meats and cheeses as well as eggs and bacon for those who want it. The front desk staff were unobtrusively helpful and the small bar is an oasis in a busy city.We loved the Francois 1 and would love to go back in a heartbeat ',GOOD,
'Excellent choice My wife and I stayed at this hotel June 8 to June 14, 2008. We found the hotel to be excellent in all respects. Absolutely great location, next to Champs Elysee, metro and all, but still very private and quiet. Very nice, tastefully decorated common areas such as lobby, sitting areas, fabulous breakfast room. Free wireless internet in the lobby, not particularly fast, but worked. If you want faster, in-room internet, wired or wireless, it is available at additional charge from a third party provider. The breakfast in the morning was outstanding, we never wanted to leave.....Room decor was very nice, good A/C system, very nice bathroom with marble floor, well decorated. Everything worked well in the room. Small flat panel TV, many international channels, CNN Europe version etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful, made several calls on our behalf to restaurants and museums, shuttle service. I loved the small size of the hotel (40 rooms); makes you feel more at home away from home than in a hotel. The room we were in was not large: if you are looking for a large room, this may not be the place....Overall, it was a wonderful stay, I would go back there in a minute. ',GOOD,
'Gorgeous romantic boutique hotel This is a beautiful little hotel in a great location just off the Champs Elysees. The staff are all lovely, the decor is very chic but traditional, and the rooms are compact but extremely comfortable.My husband and I stayed here for our first anniversary and it was just perfect. It's in a very stylish part of the city with designer shops and trendy bars and restaurants nearby. It's really close to the Metro, but because it's on a little side street it's very quiet. I love the individual styling of the rooms - so much more welcoming and cosy than some boring chain hotel.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially those looking for a romantic getaway. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Hotel! I booked this hotel through a travel agents, and didn't really have much time to read the reviews before booking. When I did I thought I had made a good choice! I was booking for a group of ten girls on a hen weekend, and the hotel gave us two executive rooms and three standard rooms for the same price, which was nice. The hotel is very easy to find, our land mark was Louis Vuitton! On arrival the reception staff were so helpful, helping a large group to check in and asking about our journey. One of my friends wanted to change rooms and this was done without fuss, so we could be next door to one another.  This hotel has a great location and we could walk along Champs Elysee and to Arc and the Louvre (about a 30 minute stroll). The metro stop is just a few minutes walk away too, so no problems getting around Paris.  I visited three different rooms in the hotel where my friends were staying and they were all lovely. Gorgeous bathrooms with toiletries and bath robes included. Plenty of space in rooms to hang clothes etc. The beds are so comfortable and big, and on the last night three of us slept in one with no problems at all!  The staff here are lovely and so helpful, booking us taxis, and gioving reccomendations for restaurants and clubs to go to. They were happy to take photographs of the whole group too! Breakfast is served from 7 til 11am which is great if you had a late night! The room is nice and a huge selection of food including cereal, fresh fruit, yoghurt, chesse, cold meats, breads and pastries and yummy tea and coffee! All ten of us had a fabulous stay at this hotel and would definitely go back again. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did! ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Hotel We stayed at Hotel Francois 1er last minute. We were referred by another Hotel that was fully booked. What a lucky find. We thoroughly loved our stay here. We got upgraded to a suite with breakfast included. The suite was absolutely delightful. The staff were very helpful. They booked train tickets to Normandy for us, gave us some suggestions for tours up there and also stored our bags for us for 3 days so we didn't have to lug everything up there. We also needed to use the internet while we were there and they have a lovely little guest computer to use and they gave us a card to log on  off free of charge. My husband is very tall and we found the beds extremely comfortable (helped we were in a suite also!)Location is wonderful, as other reviews have said, only a very short walk to Champs Elysee and George V Metro.Would definately stay here again. No complaints whatsoever. ',GOOD,
'francois 1er Great location. 3 short blocks from George V metro stop and Champs. Clean hotel. Breakfast is adequate. Staff was fine. ',GOOD,
'Lovely French Ambiance!       Outside view from Room 403 ',GOOD,
'hotel exquis! This hotel is one of the best hotels in Paris, situated in a very quiet street, next to the designers and Champs Elys茅es. The rooms are splendid and very beautiful decorated. Also the lobby and living room are with very good taste decorated. It makes you feel at home. The breakfast-room (with good buffet!) is downstairs but also very tastefull! The staff is very helpfull. We come back to this hotel! What a beautiful souvenir! ',GOOD,
'Ok Hotel But Overprised We stayed in this hotel few days ago for only one night but we were glad it was only that night. The room was very small and the bed also, we are not very tall people but our legs were over the bed, the room very hot and for 4 star hotel |(300 euro) per night totally not worth it. We stayed the other night in a hotel called Bellechase and it was much much better. I would never stay in this hotel twice. The location is good, yes and the staff is pleasent but for there are much better hotels for that price. ',POOR,
'Fabulous and very close to all the designer stores We have stayed in this hotel twice now and thoroughly enjoyed it on both occasions. The food is divine, although this is based upon breakfast only. You are provided with a mixture of pastries and breads with your breakfast to accompany the delicious buffet. We would highly recommend Chez Francis, which is opposite the Eiffel tower for evening dining. The staff were so helpful and that service second to none.The standard rooms are small but decadantly furnished and the bathrooms are well equipped. ',GOOD,
'Lovely place in a great location       Our room ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Stay Our stay in early January went well beyond our hopes. From the friendly welcome to the lovely room, the excellent breakfast and the superb location just off the Champs Elysees, it is hard to see how anything could have been better. I would certainly stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Gorgeous hotel in excellent location I booked the hotel on a special rate through a Leisure Direction offer in a newspaper - the agent had been extremely complimentary about it, and having done a fair amount of research after booking, I had high hopes and high expectations - I am delighted to report that these were all met.First things first - Location! The hotel is excellently located just off the Champs Elysees - go to George V metro, take the George V exit, and go to the right of Louis Vuitton. Take the second road on the left and it is 100m down the road - how easy is that?!!Having read the various reviews below, I decided to upgrade to a superior room, and so cut a deal with the hotel - so was especially pleased to find that we had in fact been upgraded to an executive room. Ludevine, who I had been in correspondence with was the person who checked us in, and was charming, setting the tone for the whole stay. Rather than the normal reception area where you stand on one side, and the staff on the other, the reception is extremely civilised - all parties sit down at a desk!Our room was on the 6th (top) floor, overlooking the courtyard, so was incredibly quiet. I think it may be the red one that features on the website - it certainly seemed to match the photos (other than one picture now being on a different wall! It was fairly spacious for a Paris hotel (having stayed in some absolutely tiny rooms in Paris in the past), was very well appointed and had a great bathroom - the water pressure was high so the bath filled quickly and the shower was powerful, the hot water was very hot, and the smellies supplied were good. Also had bathrobes and slippers.Breakfast was included on our deal, so we had it every day - if it is not included you may think you don't want to pay 21 euros - but as they serve until 11am,, you could have a late breakfast and save on buying lunch! The choice was excellent - various juices, including freshly squeezed orange, glasses of yoghurt with fresh fruit, or commercial ones if you preferred, a good selection of cold meats and cheeses, fruit salad and fresh fruit, smoked salmon, crabcake, asparagus, salad, and hot eggs and sausages, cakes, pastries etc - so you are bound to find something you like!! There were also a selection of newspapers - Le Figaro, International Herald Tribune, The Guardian and El Pais.We had drinks in the bar one evening - the bar area is delightful - a winter garden, comfy chairs and sofas and a very helpful bar man. We had champagne cocktails, which were delicious, and about the price you would expect in a 4* hotel in Paris!Nearby there are plenty of places to eat - we tried Maison D'Aubrac in Rue Marberf - but there are lots of restaurants in that street so you should find something to please. We also tried Noura at 27 Ave Marceau - their posh one is at 21, but the food is excellent at 27, and the prices are cheaper! If you like Lebanese cooking, this is highly recommended. Further afield, we can highly recommend Maceo on the Rue de Petit Champs, near the Palais Royal and Le Petit Chatelet, next door to Shakespeare  Co book shop opposite Notre Dame on the left bank. (Rue de la Bucherie)If you are a museum buff, try the Musee Guimet, which is about 10 mins walk away from the hotel - it is the museum of Asiatic Art and was an excellent find - and is free until 30 June as an experiment (as is the Musee Cluny in the Latin Quarter, so do visit to help persuade the authorities that free museums are the way to go!!)Apologies for the long review - but do stay in this hotel - it really is as good as everyone suggests! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Chic magnificent I booked this weekend for four friends to celebrate our 40th birthdays and was apprehensive that all would be fine. My expectations were exceeded as we approached the hotel. We were met by name by the hotel manager and trying to speak in French, to practice, he was both patient and gracious and we were soon installed in our respective rooms. For once the photos and reviews did not disappoint as the hotel was classic luxury. There were the usual trimmings we expect in a hotel but to find it so clean and welcoming was a bonus. Our needs at every turn were met from a word of advice to a wonderful breakfast. All the staff we met went out of their way to make this a memorable visit one I wish to repeat if I am ever in Paris again. The hotel is indeed very close to the Champs de Lyse - come out of the George the V metro turn right at Louis Vuitton and then right again at Armani on George V Ave. I highly reccommend this hotel to anyone wanting a little luxury in the heart of Paris. ',GOOD,
'Charming boutique hotel Excellent experience. Charming small luxury hotel in the heart of Paris just a few minutes walk from Champs Elysees and main metro stationsStayed there only one night but I wish it were longer. Confortable and clean rooms and bathroom. Excellent breakfast with a wide choice of warm and cold dishes to meet every need. Kind English speaking staff.If you are looking for a treat in Paris with a very good value for money don't bother to search further: Francois 1er Hotel is just perfect. ',GOOD,
'Superb Excellent Hotel, great staff, English speaking. I can thoroughly recommend. Contact me if you are going soon with any further questions. ',GOOD,

'Great Location Stayed 24th 鈥?27th August 2007The location of the hotel is excellent, it is 2 minutes walk from the Louis Vuitton shop on the Champs Elysees and just a bit further to the Arch de Triumph. It is also an easy walk to the Seine and the Eiffel Tower, and there is also a tube station close by. So a good base to explore from.The hotel is very nicely decorated; everything is immaculate, though they do seem to have a bit of a book fetish, with the lift walls lined with fake books, fake book doors. There is a nice lounge and a bar area, with yes more books.Breakfast is served in a pretty breakfast room, and there is a good selection from fresh fruit, cereal, bread, pastries, cold meat, smoked salmon and some mornings a hot option as well. The other good thing is that breakfast is served until 11:00 so you can be a bit relaxed if you want. The service was good, and the staff were friendly and helpful.The downside; I expected a small room, rooms in London are small but it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in without asking to be moved. That said it was very nicely decorated, it had everything you need, with double doors that opened on to a roof garden. The air con worked perfectly and with good black out curtains and a comfortable bed, we had probably the best nights sleep we had in ages. The bathroom was also nice, with a double end bath, powerful shower, and plentiful towels. Maid service was good and we had a turn down service including chocolates and a weather forecast. Whilst in Paris we did a dinner cruise with Bateaux Parisiens, it was a great way to see the main sights, the food was good, there was music and the wine flowed, we both enjoyed it. The only problem was I had scallops as a main course and it was perhaps not a good choice in view of the mass catering. They also had someone walking round answering questions about the sights, as well as a map with descriptions as part of the dinner menu. We paid extra for premier, which meant you had priority boarding, a table for 2 at the front of the boat so the best view and better wine. We booked this in advance with top table on the net and it was significantly cheaper doing it this way.On our last night we ate at Pershing Hall. It is a French / Asian fusion restaurant, expensive, but we had a fantastic meal, excellent service, we really liked the ambiance, subtle lighting and d茅cor. The main restaurant is on two levels with tables outdoors in the courtyard or upstairs. We had a table upstairs in a balcony over looking the courtyard, which was perfect. ',POOR,
'My favorite Hotel in Paris I am traveling to Paris a lot, but Francois 1er is my favorite, very well located, nice rooms, a bit small, friendly staff, great breakfast (love the smoked salmon and the caviar), but the bread is a bit stale and the phone does not work in the breakfast room (I do not know if this is good or bad) ',GOOD,
'Orchids and velvet This was our third trip to Paris and after staying in two indifferent hotels on previous visits, we decided to splash out on a two night stay at the Francois 1er. We loved it and would happily return. It is a romantic, boutique hotel with friendly staff and a lovely feeling of peace, despite being only two minutes walk from the frenzied traffic of the Champs Elysees. Our room was a good size, absolutely spotless and had a quiet outlook over a small courtyard garden. The decor was sumptuous; lots of velvet, rich reds and golds and a marble bathroom. We loved the little thoughtful touches like the light in the wardrobe and the sweeties with the turn-down service at night. The hotel's public areas seemed to be full of spectacular orchids and the cosy lounge had a small botanic glasshouse as a backdrop. The breakfast room was equally attractive and the range on offer in the buffet was splendid - caviar, smoked salmon and Coco Pops all made an appearance!The location is excellent for the Metro, airport bus transfers and for the whole Champs Elysees, Rue du Faubourg area. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'excellent choice this hotel made all the difference in our trip. the service was superb. their recommendations/help with reservations for a dinner cruise on the river made for one of our best evenings. the room was small but lovely. breakfast was a great spread and such a relaxing atmosphere. location was nice as well.the day manager  bellman both really went out of their way for us. it was a pleasure. ',GOOD,
'Everthing that Glitters is not Gold! Wonderful room and excellent location to tour sites/buses. Outstanding breakfast buffet. Main recommendation: Use hotel safe! On my last day a specially calculated inside plot was carried out by the staff when someone entered my room and as a result one credit card and my driver's license was taken out of wallet from my purse. Manager's comments to Go-Today.com was he was sorry I lost my wallet. He told Go-Today.com he would contact me directly after his vacation. Go-today.com said they would also follow up with me and the hotel. Well it has been almost one year and I have not heard from either the group. The wallet was not lost when specific items where removed while I was downstairs (basement area) eating breakfast. Because my entire wallet was not taken I did not realize the missing items until I was at an airport concession stand. Sorry to say that the only people who had access to the room was staff. Also because the hotel is small they can easily track your every move - when you leave and return to the room. Please feel free to contact me via email if you need more detailed information about the events that follow. ',POOR,
'Enjoyed my Visit to Paris Hotel Francois 1er is a lovely hotel 2 minutes from the George V metro stop and the Champs-Elysees. The staff is very friendly and helpful, room was small but tidy and breakfast was nice. They have a small staff that remembers the guests and provides recommendations for meals, sightseeing and other touristy information. The only issue was the spotty high-speed internet connection. I was only able to connect the first day, after that I could not get a connection in spite of help from the service provider. This is a small complaint from an otherwise wonderful stay in Paris. ',GOOD,
'Loved breakfast Small, intimate and luxurious hotel with friendly and accurate service. We especially enjoyed the breakfast service, although it unfortunately was not included in the price. The hotel is not cheap by all means, but is worth the money. The entire district around it is rather posh.The breakfast personnel is not French but Cambodian and Vietnamese, which certainly is not a negative thing, they are VERY friendly and accurate. We had a nice experience with staff member Anh, but also with her collegues. Compare this to some other high class places in the city (for instance the Opera district), and you will agree. ',GOOD,
'Great stay Spent 3 days at hotel May 11-14. Lovely spot. Quiet, quaint.Room was clean, small by North American standards but absolutely comfortable. Very well located. Good restaurants nearby. Our room, which faced the interior , was very quiet. Staff was very helpful. Any one looking for a good , small hotel would be happy staying here. Only issue, which they should address( presumably a computer problem), is that no one was able to contact us at the hotel. Apparently neither of us was registered. Room was reserved under both names and even after checking in, friends were told we were not registered.Not a huge issue for us, but could be for others. ',GOOD,
'Decadence This hotel was hard to find initially but then when we wandered in the right direction I couldn't believe how close to the Champs Elysses we actually were! It's a gorgeous hotel, the rooms are tiny but that's Paris! The staff were lovely and the bar was more like being in someone's (very posh) living room. Beautiful place, very swanky but didn't feel we had to put on our airs and graces at all! No pretence just gorgeousness!Plus we got three nights for the price of two! ',GOOD,
'Parisian Elegance in a romantic setting Spent our 3rd wedding anniversary in Paris this past weekend and was delighted with the Francois 1er. Loved the hotel - the room was fabulous, staff were exceptionally friendly and everything about the hotel from the location, to the decor to the service were 100% perfect. Highly recommended!!!! And have dinner around the corner at Pershing Hall - sublime! ',GOOD,
'Hard to find but worth it       hotel and yoga studio on a sidestreet ',GOOD,
'The best small hotel off the Champs Elysees We stayed for three nights last week and, from the moment we stepped through the door, we were greeted by friendly staff. We were taken to an excellent room with well appointed bathroom. We were given English newspapers. The bed was turned down at night and a card left with tomorrow's weather forecast on it ( and two sweets). The breakfast next morning was amazing with a wide choice of things to eat and drink. Because it was my wife's birthday we were given a card for a free glass of champagne.We could not have had a better stay in Paris! The hotel is just off Avenue George V which itself is just off the Champs Elysees. A perfect location! ',GOOD,
'Fab hotel and excellent service We (husband and I) stayed at the hotel from 18th to 22nd Feb and loved it. Although not large, the hotel is beautifully appointed, service was excellent and it was in a great location for shopping and restaurants just off the Champs Elysees. Our room was very quiet. Additionally my father stayed one night and also enjoyed it. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful, Clean, Quiet  My husband and I stayed in this hotel in early Jan. 2007 for 6 nights -- our first trip to Paris -- and booked the flight and hotel through GoTravel.com the previous August on one of their package travel deals. This hotel was a Superior Hotel upgrade from the bottom line hotel offered in the package deals. I did not want our first visit to Paris to be tainted by a less than nice hotel, so I decided to splurge on the accommodations a bit. I confirmed our reservation through email directly with the hotel before we arrived and got a prompt and friendly affirmative reply. We arrived late morning we were greeted warmly and given a Standard room (as we expected) within 10 minutes, although we arrived before check-in time (I had warned them about this in my email). We were also offered a coupon for a free glass of champagne in the bar and told about the breakfast buffet, etc. The web site photos make the hotel appear much larger than it really is, but still, it is beautifully decorated and very clean. Our standard room (#307) looked very similar to the photo on the hotel's website [--], but I suspect we got the smallest standard room they had because there was no room for an upholstered chair along side the bed and we certainly did not have fresh flowers in our room. The room faced a small open-air courtyard flanked by office buildings; in other words there was no view. Eh, we knew we wouldn't spend that much time in the room anyway and were not in a mood to complain about such an inconsequential detail. And everything else was very nice anyway. The tub was enormous and kept spotlessly clean, thank goodness. This is the first hotel I have ever stayed in where I felt comfortable taking a hot bath (to ease my tired and weary feet and legs from so much walking). Beautiful marble tile and carpentry details made it a pleasure to be in this room, all of which looked clean and well-maintained.Since we were staying in January, we did not use the air conditioning, but there was a thermostat in our room. It tended to get a little stuffy, so we opened the window a bit for cool sleeping. Nice.We were following Rick Steve's Guide to Paris for almost all of our sightseeing and restaurant choices, but on a couple of occasions, we asked the front desk for their restaurant recommendations for a simple, quiet restaurant with plain good food. Both times, we were disappointed with their recommendations, mainly because they only recommended Champs-Elysees restaurants and the area is quite expensive. We quickly discovered that our taste (and buget) was geared more toward cafes -- for both lunch and dinner. We tend to feel uncomfortable in fancy, pretentious places anyway, although we like nice hotels. So we usually ended up taking the Metro out of the Champs-Elysees area to go to dinner. Next time, we may just find a nice hotel in one of the cafe areas, since we usually come back to our hotel before dinner anyway.(We came to the conclusion that perhaps the hotel's usual clientele are business people with an expense account, and that perhaps the hotel is now trying to market themselves more to tourists by participating in travel packages. Just a guess.)The breakfast buffet was included with our room and it was such a great way to start our day. Served from 7 to 11, the buffet had everything you'd want and more. From a basket of fresh croisants and bagettes on your table, to the fresh fruit, cold cereal, fruit juices, sliced meats and vegetables, a broad selection of cheeses, scrambled eggs, Vienna sausages (yum), fruit tortes and tarts, and a tower of fresh oranges and apples, that you can take for a snack later. Wow - c'est incroyable! Very pleasant waitstaff as well. Some of the business people staying in the hotel held breakfast meetings in the breakfast area and unfortunately, everyone is subjected to their conversations. On a couple of occasions, a few cosmetic surgeons (and reps) were discussing breast augmentation and botox injections. Wish they had waited until lunch for that....We give the Francois 1er Hotel an excellent rating because they are good at what they are: a clean, quiet, secure and beautiful boutique hotel (albeit a little pricey) located in one of the most upscale and lovely areas of Paris. We would recommend the hotel, but on our next visit we will likely stay in an area with more choices for dinner (cafes). ',GOOD,
'wonderful hotel wonderful location The Hotel Francois 1er right off the Champs-Elysees is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. The service, rooms, and food are first class and the location couldn't be better! We had a wonderful week. The rooms are beautiful and the service was very efficient. We would definitely return to this this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Perfect stay in Paris We spent two nights at the hotel in Sept.We have absolutely no complaints. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms lovely. The location excellent.We asked if we may use the room for the day of our check out since we were taking the Orient Express late that night.They were very accomodating and we were given the use of the room until the evening and at less money than was listed in the information.We would definately stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Absolutely beautiful hotel. This is one of the nicest small hotels I have stayed in. ( I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in The Ritz hotel in London and in The Plaza in NY as well as many other prestigous hotels around the world) My friend and I booked to stay in this hotel for a weekend shopping/sightseeing break and we were really pleased with our choice of hotel. We were welcomed by a very friendly member of staff, Francois, who offered us tea in the sitting room whilst we awaited to check in, a lovley touch, and then escorted to our room, which was well located, with excellent decor and facillities, and most of all very clean and comfortable.We found all the staff very helpful and pleasant which just helped to make this elegant hotel a very special place to stay. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone and take it from me I am very hard to please as far as hotels go. This is a true gem. You must try Laduree Patisserie for lunch or tea, it is the French version of Bettys in York, very nice. You will not be disappointed. ',GOOD,
'Best Place to stay when visiting Paris This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, and both times it has been the best experience. From the attentive staff to the well-appointed rooms, nothing is over looked. Last year we happened upon the hotel through an ad and booked it, much to our delight it is right off the Champ Elysees and located in the best shopping neighborhoods and close to the major site seeing attractions. When returning to Paris this year, we considered no other property and promptly rebooked at this hotel. Upon making the reservation, we were greeted with an acknowledgement email stating that they were happy to have us as a returning guest.The hotel is small and has a bouquet setting, which allows personal interaction with the staff. We found the entire staff, regardless of the hour of day, to be friendly and extremely accommodating. From recommendations to restaurants, arranging transportation to and from the airport, to assisting with site-seeing tours, they are happy to ensure that our stay was pleasant. The rooms are nicely decorated, clean, with all the modern amenities.This year, we decided to add an extra night (on our last night of stay), even though the hotel was completely booked they assured us that this would not be a problem; due to either a cancellation in the morning or they would arrange for us to stay at another property at the same rate. Fortunately in the morning, we were informed that we would be able to stay here at the hotel.We highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Paris, where else can you feel the romance of the city than right off the Champs Elysees! We are DEFINETLY coming back to Paris and to this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Beware of Francois 1er- Arrogant staff, broken ACs and Shaking loud rooms Me and my husband chose Paris for our Honeymoon and stayed at the Francois 1er. This was the biggest mistake. The website for Francois 1er seemed good to us, but beware there is no hospitality there.This hotel is one of the worst we stayed in and that too regretabbly on our honeymoonDay one- we had asked for a shuttle service from the airport if it exists. They sent a Cab. Our flight was late by 2 hours and the hotel insisted we pay the Cab driver over 120 Euros for waiting for us in the airport. We had not asked that he wait. The management- an arrogant man by the name of Wasir/wasim insisted that we pay the entire amount right then and held us liable for it. And of course no welcome drink was offered to us. Night one- Jetlagged we went to sleep in the room given.We were woken up with loud banging noises.Apparently there was construction going on on the next building and our room kept shaking. The noises were so loud that the walls shook. Apparently there was some renovation in the attached building!Day 2-When we complained they told us that they are overbooked and that they would give us another room in the evening if there is a vacancy but then we had to wait. Night 2-They did give us another room finally, but the AC was not working. When we complained again, they said that there is nothing they can do, we will have to wait till morning as there is no one to fix it . And the other rooms also had broken ACs so we cant be moved. This is a 4 star hotel where the ACs dont work and nothing is done! Finally the ACs began working in the early dawn.Day3- Since they did not give the welcome drink on Day one , Wasir/Wasim decided to magnanimously give us 2 glasses of champagne ( the welcome drink) to make up for 2 sleepless nights we had to endure. He made it seem he was doing us a huge favor.And this was our honeymoon!!!!!!Beware. Do not go there unless you want to be treated with disdain and arrogance. Motel 6 is more hospitable than this so called Boutique hotel and you pay far less. Check out other better hotels in the same neighborhood ',POOR,

'A lovely jewel of a hotel steps from the Champs Elysees The Hotel Francois Premier is a beautiful boutique hotel on a quiet street in a chic section of Paris. The hotel is immaculate and beautifully decorated. It is like staying at the home of wealthy friends. The staff is charming and accomodating. There are fresh flowers and flowering plants throughout the hotel. The bathrooms are gorgeous and stocked with upscale amenities.The breakfast room is beautiful and the food is delicious and well presented. There is a large selection of cookies, fruits, cereals etc. I took a package of Petit Ecoliers everyday to have as a snack later!The bar is charming and the bartender was very handome and amusing. It's a pleasure just to hang out in the hotel! I look forward to a return visit!!Elegant but unpretentious; Intimate and friendly--I much prefer it to a larger, fancier hotel. ',GOOD,
'Subtle and effective service, fabulous little hotel We stayed in this hotel during the height of the summer Paris season this June. Myself, my husband, and my six-year old son very much enjoyed our stay.The hotel staff was amazing. They were always there to lend a helpful hand with a tremendously positive attitude. When my son accidentally left behind a plush toy, they contacted me and immediately mailed it out so it was waiting for us when we arrived home.Breakfast is a little buffet with a good variety of foods. The rooms are small but well-appointed, and there was plenty of space for a rollaway bed for my son. Bathrooms are fabulous and well-designed. Hotel is very quiet and subtly elegant.Just a couple of blocks from the George V metro station, and from the Champs. Was right in the thick of things without the price or the noise of being right on the Champs. One of the things which amazed me were the number of languages the staff new. From many European languages, to Japanese, Chinese, and what sounded like Vietnamese -- many travelers will find themselves at ease in communicating no matter where they are from. (I hesitate to say the typical 'they speak english so well! for fear of being accused an obstanate American. But it is important to note that indeed they do speak english well if you are from a country that speaks a language I did not already list.)I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. We very much appreciated our stay and will stay again. ',GOOD,
'the best boutique hotel in paris We stayed in this hotel 6 nights in june 2006 and we had a lovely stay.We used to go to a world known hotel nearby but also veryexpensive.We reserved a suite on the 2nd floor with balcony.The suite was large with a nice sitting area and the bathroom was amazing with bath and shower.The bed was also very confortable and everything in the room was well maintained and very clean.The buffet breakfast was also a great value with smoked salmon and fresh fruit salad.The lobby is charming and the bar very peaceful. The staff were very efficient and very polite. We have found our new hotel in paris and will definitely return next time. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Sometimes you get lucky. My son and I got lucky on our last trip to Paris. We had reserved in a hotel which turned out to be less than what we had hoped (not to be named, because the people there were so nice that I鈥檇 feel badly about dissing their place of employment). The problems: room smelled of smoke, small room (not unexpected in Paris but unexpected when we had reserved an 鈥渆xecutive鈥?room 鈥?I can鈥檛 imagine what the standard room was like), boring, contemporary furniture and, worst of all, construction starting at 7.00 am right next door. So the first thing we did was to wander the neighbourhood to try to find something more appealing. Walked into a couple of hotels, saw a couple of rooms and the only one that had the dates that we wanted was the Fran莽ois 1er. Asked for the rates and were given a rate of 250鈧? no breakfast. Went back to the hotel where we were already staying, and booked online for the nights we wanted, rate of 205鈧?per night with breakfast. Checked in the next morning, and were given a room that was nicer than the one we had been shown when we visited the day before. In fact, its one of the nicest hotel rooms that I鈥檝e ever stayed in, and we travel a lot. Large by Paris standards. Room enough for a chair and small table by the window, a large armoire, and a medium size writing desk, without feeling too cramped. Beautiful d茅cor, Empire style. Excellent bathroom with a wonderful shower. All in all, a terrific experience. We were happy to get back to the room at night, and say what you will, even though we all say that the hotel is only a place to lay your head, the experience is enhanced if the room you鈥檙e living in reflects what you expect to see in Paris, This room did, and we loved it. The public rooms are also beautiful There鈥檚 a small lounge off the reception that I sat in a couple of times to read the newspaper, and I thought it was gorgeous. Again, the room you expect to see in Paris. Beautiful moldings, nice furniture 鈥?not overwhelming or so pretty as to make you reluctant to sit down: rather, welcoming and comfortable, a room that鈥檚 beautiful but at the same time looks like its been used and isn鈥檛 only for show. And the people were also terrific. Helpful, accommodating, jumping to serve at every opportunity.I forgot to mention the location. For us it was perfect, though I know many prefer the life and activity of the left bank. The Fran莽ois 1er is two blocks off of the Champs Elysee, not more than three minutes from Metro George V. Easy access from everywhere. Our room gave out on to an interior courtyard. Completely quiet. Excellent sleeping I can assure you that I鈥檒l be trying to get a room there the next time I鈥檓 in Paris 鈥?in fact I鈥檒l even try to get the same room. Enjoy. ',GOOD,

'Very nice stay This was by far our best stay on this trip. The staff was very friendly and the room quite comfortable. It was great to have a kitchenette and a huge bathroom. Though we never made it to the wine and tea afternoons, I loved that they offered this. The breakfast was nothing exciting, but it was there if you needed a nibble. Checking in and out were a breeze. There is a board in the lobby with helpful hints from other travellers on places to go and those to avoid. I guess it just felt more homey than the more impersonal modern hotels we stayed at. I would definately stay here again and it will be my first choice for the next trip. ',GOOD,
'Beresford Arms - I was pleasantly surprised Trying to find a comfortable, well located, and reasonably priced hotel in San Francisco was extremely difficult even after researching through Trip Advisor.The Beresford Arms was a very nice hotel and proved an excellent choice by the travel agent. Although it looks a bit tired, the rooms are very accommodating and the reception staff are very friendly and helpful.I was staying with my 2 boys. The hotel room had 2 QS beds and we were also provided with a rollaway bed. The room was of good size and had a small kitchenette and good sized bathroom. Rooms were very clean and serviced daily.Recommend that you ask for a room on a high floor as we were on level 2 and the street noise was pretty loud.The hotel supplied 2 p.c.'s with internet access for general use in the lounge area. Breakfast was supplied (fruit; some pastries, tea/coffee) and was a good starter for the day. The hotel also provided wine and cheese in the afternoons which was most enjoyable and provided a good networking opportunity.Location was excellent. Only 5-10 minutes from Union Square. A laundrette was right across the street. Restaurants and general stores were very close.Overall a very nice hotel. Would definitely recommend to anybody going to SF. ',GOOD,
'Couldn't be Happier! My partner and I stayed here for nine nights while in San Fran, and it was a fabulous hotel. The prices were super cheap, the room was large and clean. The staff were great and really helpful, I recommend it highly. Also across the road is a fantastic Indonesian restaurant, and if you are staying for a bit there is also a laundromat across the road run by a really friendly guy called Lee. ',GOOD,
'It is quaint but make sure you get a good room This hotel was recommended by my Travel Agent and I went along with it even though I am normally a Hyatt or Marriott type of person. It is definitely quaint and if you that is the type of thing you are into then this place is ok but you do need to watch the room that you are given. I was first of all given a room that I was told was an upgrade from what I had booked but I was appalled at the size of it - it was just too small for a weeks stay so I paid an extra US$20 per night to upgrade to a slightly bigger room that did have a small kitchen area and a jacuzzi. I have heard since about the Parlour Suites and I would have preferred something like that but I didnt know about it at the time. Here are my pros and cos:CONS:(1) There was a lot of noise from the street but I was on the top floor so it was probably less than if I had been lower down. (2) There was no view to speak of (3) It was just that little bit too far from Union Square especially with a bad ankle limping back after a hard day touringPROS(1) The mini bar (honesty bar) was extremely reasonably priced (2) The bed was quite comfortable (3) There was a laundrette right opposite and also a small supermarket - very handy (4) The continental breakfast was a bonus as was the evening wine and cheese and (5) The staff were extremely helpful and took time and effort to assist with directionsSo the pros do outweigh the cons and if you are looking for somewhere unusual and different (and dont mind walking) then this is the place. Just make sure you know what type of room you are getting. ',POOR,
'Excellent value; Great Service My husband and I spent three nights at The Beresford Arms and we were so impressed with the size of the room. We were upgraded to a junior suite which has 2 double beds, a small kitchen, lots of closet space, and a very large bathroom. There is a complimentary wine and cheese from 4:30 - 5:30p.m. in the elegant lobby which is a great way to end a day of touring. The best part of our experience at this hotel was the staff - they are outstanding. We will definitely return. ',GOOD,
'character and charm We had 4 nights in a junior suite and were pleasantly surprised to find a kitchen with stove and everything you would need to cook if you wanted too. Not that you need to, breakfast in the mornings and happy hour, with restaurants close. The thai noodle was great although not licensed. The room we had was large and very comfortable and the people behind the front desk were helpful. Union square and shopping only a short walk away.A place with character. ',GOOD,
'The BEST VALUE in San Francisco! Essentially, I agree with the positive comments that have already been stated by other reviewers. My story is as follows:I had a problem with the noise in my room (my only problem there)... apparently there were some kids having some sort of graduation party down the hall. I'm not a complainer, but I was meeting a client in the morning and needed my rest. I called the front desk and asked for the manager. It took a mere 5 minutes for the hotel OWNER to come up to the room, fix the problem, and offer me complimentary ACCOMMODATIONS if I wanted! Of course, being the just and gracious person that I am, I declined his extremely generous (and totally unwarranted) offer, and thanked him for his time.How often does a hotelier actually address his clients problems?! I am an attorney from New York, and rarely do I see such service in the corporate cases filed by me or the opposing parties. I know that this particular owner has another hotel and other investments to take care of, so it's extremely impressive that he takes the time and energy to deal with such problems so conscientiously. Stay here, help out small-business America, and enjoy the old-world charm, cleanliness, and top-class service. ',GOOD,
'Clean! Good Price! My daughter and I visited S.F for first time and stayed at Beresford Arms. We first thought it was a rough neighborhood, but found out next morning it was not. We thought the rooms were very clean (important) and beds were comfortable. We did have a jacuzzi tub which we did not use. But the kitchen was convienent for ice and keeping our water and soft drinks cold. We wished we were a little closer to restaurants and Union Square. A long uphill walk for someone on a cane. The hotel staff was great! and booked all of our tours. We enjoyed the continental breakfast and happy hour. We would recommend and stay again. Good price. ',GOOD,
'Great value and location We stayed at the Beresford Arms hotel for 4 nights and were very pleased with the location and the hotel itself. It is a short 10 minute walk to Union Square and Market Street, and another 10 perhaps to ChinaTown. The hotel itself is in the historic district, and has with some very interesting architecture. Our large room was on the 8th floor and had two large windows that open, a desk and extra chairs, and a bar refrigerator in the room. Beresford Arms is charming , clean and the staff was very accommodating. The staff nicely provided us with extra pillows, and kept our room spotlessly clean. The front desk people were always pleasant and helpful. The price for our superior room averaged $135 per night and included coffee, tea, hot cocoa, fresh fruit and breakfast pastries, all available in the front lobby each morning. The lobby itself is quite large, with big windows and lots of little tables and chairs set up for relaxed reading, snacking, or meeting other guests. Two computers are available for your use at no charge in the lobby. We would recommend Beresford Arms again for someone looking for affordable, clean and comfortable accommodations. We used it as our base for daily outings and used the cable cars, buses and walked everywhere for the 5 days we were there. ',GOOD,
'Charming Clean, charming, and great location. That was all we were looking for in a hotel, and we got it at Beresford Arms. After doing a wearying search through Hotels.com, Orbitz, etc. we were deciding between this place and a place across the street, the Fitzgerald (we decided on BA after reading about the bed bugs at F... yikes).The prices are fair, average really, considering all hotels in the Union Square area aren't cheap to begin with. The location, as I said, was fabulous. We walked to/from the hotel at all hours of the night and day and had no problems. (Weekend nights seem safest, since all the tourists/night owls are still out and about well past midnight). The trains, bus lines, and shopping center are all within 3-4 blocks, and there are about a dozen little restaurants and stores to choose from within a 2-3 block area (for less than $20 a meal, the Thai place across the street had surprisingly decent food). As for the hotel itself, yes, there is a bit of a funky/musty smell in the lobby and hallways, but if you've ever stepped foot into an older apartment complex or non-renovated home, you shouldn't be too alarmed. There were absolutely NO musty odors in our suite (it actually smelled very good) so I have nothing to complain about there. Our room was extremely large, the bathroom spacious and clean, and the beds very comfortable. The honor bar prices are very decent (cheaper than the liquor store's). I really can't say enough about this hotel. Maybe it's just me because I was really looking for an older, European-style hotel with a lot of charm, but something about this place just makes me want to go back and spend a week there. I guess it had a lot to do with the FANTASTIC view of the tops of all the buildings from our windows. We totally spent every morning and night gazing out. (We also had a great view of two hippie-types who were camping out on the rooftop of a smaller hotel next to ours. Far out.) Not to mention the breakfast pastries and coffee every morning in the lobby, as well as the wine/cheese hour in the afternoons! I'm sure there are other hotels with as much charm as this one (and I'll probably be checking one of those out next time I go to SF) but for our first time in the city, this was a great choice. ',GOOD,
'Hotel from the 1970s We booked this hotel having had difficulty finding accommodation in San Francisco for our family of 5 (why is it family rooms aren't included in internet searches?). The hotel website looked basic but good, reviews were ok on this website and we confirmed direct with the hotel that there were enough beds and room for a family of 5 to comfortably stay for a few nights at $360 per night.On arrival, the staff were very friendly and helpful although the with the Bell Porter wearing a tee-shirt it kind of set the level this hotel operates at. The reception desk is old fashioned and in desperate need of a makeover (as is the whole place) but the worst thing about the initial impression of this place was the smell - old and stale. Awful.The room wasn't much better - although the size and number of beds were excellent (2 queens and a pull-down queen). However, the carpet had long since seen better days, with stains and holes, the place was dusty, the windows and window ledges were filthy, the plastic pull down blinds were dirty and some torn, the net curtains (yes I did say that) could also have done with a wash - generally very shabby. The bathroom and bedding was all clean however.The kitchenette was functional - just. The sink was next to the electric old fashioned ring hob (no health and safety then) and the ring elements were loose - bearing the electric contacts. Nice in a family room that. The fridge was working and stocked with the basics - beer, juices and water.Worst of all, however, was the single-glaze windows letting in all the noise outside from Jones and Post Street. No chance of a lie in past 5 am if you're a light sleeper - plus there was no heating or air con available - making the room cold at night and stuffy in the day.Internet was a joke - a hint of a wireless net in the room that my phone and lappie detected occasionally but as the hotel didn't provide any info I don't even know if it was the hotels net. There were 2 internet machines in the main lobby, but they were restricted software-wise (so searches on expedia, for instance, were not possible on one of them) and the browser was an ancient version of Firefox or something - the screen size was all messed up anyway so you couldn't see the full web pages.Breakfast - served up fruit and pastries in the main lobby out of plastic tupperware. We didn't bother. Nor did we hang around for the wine, cheese and crackers at 4.30.Needless to say that we checked out early the next day and walked down the street to a modern hotel (there are plenty to choose from on Post Street) and got a room for $140 per night cheaper with all the mod cons, clean and with food that we dared feed our kids. If you're on a budget, backpacking, or just a sucker for old retro places then have at it. If you're after a modern, clean place to enjoy with your family then give this place a wide berth. ',POOR,
'Old but nice We stayed for 7 nights in August. We had a room on the top floor. The room needs updating but the beds were very comfy. Breakfast was fine, when they offered apples or bananas we would take an extra one for a late morning snack. After enjoying the cheese and crackers one night we started eating a late lunch and then for supper had the cheese and crackers. The microwave came in handy for warming up leftovers when the cheese and crackers weren't enough. The staff was friendly. The only thing that irritated us was that the free internet connection seemed to break down frequently. The day we wanted to print out our boarding passes the internet was working and I thought I printed the boarding passes, but the two persons behind the desk said it wasn't working. Theyinformed us that we either had to go the internet coffee shop or to their sister hotel. We went to the sister hotel and got them printed off there. The next day at check out our boarding papers were there. ',GOOD,
'Decent but very noisy We stayed at this hotel in July for two days. We enjoyed the location of the hotel (5 minutes from Union Square). The breakfast was nice. We really liked the wine and cheese in the afternoon. The room was clean and spacious. The major problem was the noise. We were given a room on the second floor. You could hear extremely loud street noise until late at night. People outside on the sidewalk talking and screaming plus cars, buses prevented sleep. It was the noisiest room I've stayed at in a long time. I don't ask for much as a traveller. A clean and quiet room in a decent location is all I need. We switched rooms for the second night and moved to a higher floor. We were satisfied with the noise level the second night. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again but not at a lower room facing the street. ',POOR,
'Value for Money and a touch of faded style We checked some web-sites to get a good price and then contacted the hotel. They were happy to go with that price.We arrived at about 12:00 midnight, but check-in was easy. We were allocated a first-floor room next to the lift. We thought it might be noisy, but it was very quiet. The room was clean and very large with a seperate kitchen.The view was less than wonderful, unless you have an interest in bricks - The view was of a wall about 6 feet away!Breakfast is enough to set you up for the day, and wine and cheese in the afternoon is an added bonus.Location is pretty good. A tip for tourists: If you want to get a ride on the cable cars, you don't need to queue at the cable car stations for hours to buy tickets, you can buy the Muni passes at the drug store (Walgreaves?). If you get the bus up to Nob Hill area, we found that you could get onto the Cable car without queuing. ',GOOD,
'Value for Money       The Bresford Arms ',GOOD,
'A decent value in SF This hotel was very reasonably priced compared to many other places in SF. The hotel is a Victorian-style place; all the furnishings and decor are older. However, the standard room was very small. The bathroom was even smaller. If you are traveling with someone, I recommend booking one of the suites, as it will probably be more roomy. There was an honor bar in our room, which was very reasonably priced ($2 for a beer, which is way cheap). The wireless internet did not work very well, and neither did the television, which was irritating, but I didn't spend much time in the room anyway (and neither should anyone who visits this city). There is no on-site parking, so the hotel offers valet service with a separate company down the street. With tax, it was about $28/day, and it was about a 15 minute wait for my car. The hotel was within walking distance to Union Square and Chinatown. I also walked from the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Plaza Market (by the Bay Bridge), and North Beach, but I don't recommend walking to those places if you have bad knees or tire easily - the streets can be challenging! A cab from the hotel to ATT Park was very reasonable, at about $8. This hotel also offers breakfast, as well as a wine and cheese hour from 4:30-5. If you're looking for a reasonably priced place to sleep, check out this hotel. ',POOR,
'Great location, quirky service, would stay again The Beresford is in a great location for all sites, near Union Square and walkable (if you're reasonably healthy) to most of the major attractions - or a short taxi/tram ride if you're not.Breakfast basic - muffins, fruit, croissants plus juice and coffee - but more than enough to set you up for the uphill walking. Free internet in the lobby too which was useful. Room was decent size and clean, but on Post Street itself which made it a bit noisy.If you're tired after tramping the streets of San Fran all day, there's a fantastic Indonesian restaurant on the corner directly opposite the hotel called Borobudur - we had to book a table in the end as it's so busy every night. Also burgers, good Thai and excellent sushi within 1 min walk of the entrance - all on Post Street. If you walk round the corner and a couple of blocks down the hill on Jones, that area can get a bit seedy at night - but nothing to put you off booking.The reception staff are generally very helpful although can be a bit impatient at times. Overall, we'd stay here again if we come back to San Francisco, which is a great city. ',GOOD,
'Great place to stay Stayed at the Beresford for a recent business trip to SF. The room was way nicer than I expected for the low price that I paid. Was real close to Union Square so that was a plus. Liked the old victorian building with the current day amenities. The staff was great and I would definately stay here on my next personal trip to SF. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel, location, rooms and staff Just returned from a trip to San Francisco. I found the Beresford Arms on this website,and it has to be said the hotel is a find. The rooms are huge, good breakfast included and you are literally a 5 minute walk from Union Square, Macys, Westfield centre etc (which means your by the tram/bus stops and can get to fisherman's wharf, embarcado, etc). To put things in perspective, on the final night of our time in San Fran switched to the Hotel Stratford on union square as we had an early morning bus to catch. The room was the same price but was a fifth of the size (very very very small room), and surrounded by tramps in the evening. If you want a cheap hotel that is a good location, good rooms, etc etc, cannot recommend it highly enough! ',GOOD,
'Excellent hotel for the price in a big city We stayed at Beresford Arms four nights while we were tourists in San Francisco. I was immediately impressed by the helpfulness of the staff, beautiful decor, and huge room (we had in internet special price). The neighborhood is pretty good- especially because of the multitude of Thai and Indonesian restaurants within a block. Just don't go walking toward Market St. after 11pm- things were a bit shady. It is close to public transportation, and we never had to walk more than four blocks to find a bus or cable car. There is one bus stop right across the street. The room was extremely clean, very big, and the bathroom was enormous. There was a little wet bar with plenty of counter space. Not too many TV channels, but that doesn't really matter when you're in SF. Our room was right on the fire escape which worried me a little at first, but all the windows had chain locks on them so you can even open them at night and still feel safe (though we did not open the windows at night- the hotel was very good about temperature control, and it only got a little warm in our room the day it was 87 degrees). The breakfast is really sparse, unless you like just eating pastries for breakfast, though they had fresh fruit too which was a nice touch. Only coffee to drink though. Overall, I was really amazed at the quality of this property for the price we paid per night. It is really a gem. ',GOOD,
'Great location, needs a bit of work My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in May around Memorial Day. Overall the room was nice with a very comfortable bed. The continental breakfast is nice, and the wine and cheese every night is a good touch. Staff was receptive and helpful, but seemed a little distracted. However, there were a few things that needed a little work. The bathtub was probably the biggest issue in the room. After 5 min in the shower there would be 2-3 inches of water around your feet. We mentioned this to the front desk 2x, and on day 3 someone finally came to look at it....and poured DranO down the drain. This didn't work, but we resigned ourselves to standing in bathwater while taking a shower. It also seemed the room had not been thoroghly cleaned before we arrived; there was dust in the corners, and some snipped wires laying on the floor by one bed. The wallpaper was peeling, and hanging off the wall in the bathroom; and for an advertised junior suite, it just brought down the overall ambiance of the room. Granted these were little things, but you would think that if you are paying for a suite, you would hope the little things would be taken care of. I would recommend it for people who want to be close to Union Sq, and do not plan on spending much time at the hotel. ',POOR,
'Comfortable Tourist class hotel My wife and I spent 1 night at this hotel on our first stay in this wonderful city. It is conveniently located for tourists with a cable car stop nearby and within easy walking distance of Union Square.There was no doorman to help us get our luggage from the cab into the hotel but our check in was easy and quick. The receptionist found a room ready for us even though we arrived quite early. There was a cheerful and friendly bell hop on hand so we did get help taking our luggage to the room.The room was very clean and comfortable and of adequate size. The TV worked after I fixed a loose signal cable connection but reception was still poor on some stations. (But hey! I did not visist this beautiful city to watch TV.)The room was not air conditioned. Probably not a problem with the local climate when it is normal. However, it so happened that our visit coincided with a heat wave and temperatures topping 90 degrees. Fortunately there was a large portable fan in the room which did help keep us comfortable.The hotel provides a complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby which was OK but nothing to get excited about. There is no restaurant in the hotel but there are plenty to choose from nearby.We only had 24 hours at the hotel but due to it's convenient location we were able to see lots of the central parts of the City, Fishermans Wharf and take a boat trip round the bay.While the hotel has a slightly tired look and feel about it the staff were friendly and helpful and our room fine for a one night stay. In summary, I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced tourist class hotel in a central and convenient location. ',POOR,
'quaint and quirky A cracking hotel about 5 minutes from Union Square, plenty of fresh fruit and pastries for breakfast and a nice touch at 4.30pm when complimentary wine, cheese and crackers are served (plus fruit juice for the kids), the hotel is not new but the rooms look lived in rather than shabby. The staff were very knowledgable, courteous and helpful - would certainly return ! ',GOOD,
'Late review, but still recommend the Beresford! The Beresford is a great option if you want a nice, affordable location near Union Square. The staff was extremely helpful, and the room was very clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. Breakfast is minimal, but the afternoon wine hour is a lovely touch. I can't say this hotel would be a great value at full price, but if you can find a special deal or take advantage of lower mid-week rates, it is an excellent value for a hotel in the heart of the city. A couple of reviews have mentioned the Beresford's proximity to the sketchy Tenderloin district, but just be wise and don't walk around west of the hotel after dark. We did and didn't feel unsafe, but it's a smart precaution to take. ',GOOD,
'Great Location Older hotel, a bit run down... but in a great location for launching your day in SF. We stayed there for a weekend, no problems at all. Enjoyed the free breakfast in the morning to get your day started. ',GOOD,

'Old World Charm We returned yesterday after a week's stay and the Beresford Arms would be our first choice on a return trip.A charming hotel with tons of character. Great shower, comfortable bed. The breakfast was great with plenty of fruit that was replinished over the 3 hours. The wine and cheese was a lovely touch that allowed us to regroup and re-energise before heading out into the evening.Within walking distance to all the best shopping and famous districts. 4 main bus routes ran infront of the hotel.The cheapest minibar that I have ever encountered. ',GOOD,
'I liked the Beresford Arms I really liked the Beresford Arms. My room was a nice size, it was clean, it was quiet. Breakfast was really good: pastries and fruit, with tea. The rooms did not have internet access, but there were 2 computers downstairs in the pleasant lobby area, and there's a bar, where for the price of a drink, you can check your email on your laptop -- you have to pay if you use their computers. I loved the neighborhood, about 4 blocks from Union Sq. Close to the tourist and shopping area, but not too close. It's a colorful area, with lots of great restaurants and bars. I'd stay again at this hotel, I really thought it was good value for the $$. ',GOOD,
'average in all respects stayed there for 8 nights. clean, if a bit run-down hotel. good location, few blocks up from union square. breakfast was minimal; day-old pastries, fresh fruit and coffee. wlan did not work properly except on the first day. good value for money though. ',POOR,
'Great hotel great location We stayed at the Beresford Arms for four nights including New Years Eve. Could not have asked for more from a budget hotel in the Union Square area.. The location is great, about four blocks from Union Square. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Very clean and comfortable rooms, if a bit old-fashioned. The breakfast is fine i.e. not great but there was usually a good assortment of fruit and pastries and excellent coffee. The wine reception was so nice to come back to in the late afternnon. It involved more or less all the wine you cared to drink. We were at the Beresford Arms for New Years Eve and while there was nothing much going on in the hotel the lobby was decorated and we found champage and party favours in our room (no charge) - a very nice touch. We have stayed previously at the King George and the Andrews - no comparison at all, really. ',GOOD,
'Quaint Old World - Great Staff! I looked up the hotel on trip advisor and saw mostly good comments about the hotel. I was in San Fran during the Oracle Open World convention and like a dummy booked my hotel late. So if I was willing to pay $550 a night for the Hilton I could have. But, after a bit of research I found the Beresford Arms.The Hilton it is not, but it makes it up in large rooms with a kitchen, a bathroom with a whirlpool tub, free breakfast, and free wine and cheese in the afternoon. Additionally, the staff went out of it's way to make sure I had everything I needed.The rooms could use some updating, but I think it adds a bit of old world charm. If they were to do just one thing it might be to put tile down in the bathroom and get ride of the linoleum. What to lookout for: The street noise is a bit loud. With the old world charm comes thin windows. I recommend ear plugs if you are on the lower floors.Book a shuttle at the desk it is a few bucks cheaper than Super Shuttle.If you don't mind the small things listed above it is a clean hotel with a great staff willing to take care of you. ',GOOD,
'Great except for one thing Just got back from a weekend stay at the Beresford Arms (11/9-11/11). The hotel is located on a street filled with Thai and Asian restaurants. Right next door is a youth hostel, so there are a lot of student travelers walking around the immediate area. You are just a few blocks from Union Square and surrounded by some very colorful local bars and eateries. The Bart is maybe four blocks away.The hotel has a wine and cheese happy hour each evening (you might want to avoid the wine) and a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning, which was nice for little fuel and go-go juice to on your way to a real breakfast (Dottie's).We stayed in room 815, which straddles the elevator. We were hesitant at first that the elevator would cause a lot of noise, but it really did not. The hotel is small, so there wasn't a lot of foot traffic to the elevator and you can barely hear an electric buzz when the elevator is moving. If you have a window open for fresh air, the sounds from outside will cover up what little elevator noise there is. What did bug us was this noise from what the front desk said was the radiator system turning on to heat the hotel late at night or early morning...like 5 AM. I don't know if it is the dated system trying to get going of if someone was hitting a pipe with a hammer, but be ready for some serious clanging when the heating system starts up. It is loud and sounds like it is right above you. This might be a good reason to pass on room 815.The room itself was huge with two beds, a small kitchen, and spacious bathroom with a jacuzzi tub that we did not use...oh and a bidet too... There is a junior sized refrigerator filled with beverages that are really priced reasonably if you need to hit the honor bar. Beers were $2.25 and bottled water was $1.25. Overall it was a good stay. The lobby computers for internet access were handy and the location were great, but that clanging from the radiator system knocks a little shine off of the hotel's luster. And note that if you want a hair dryer, they are at the front desk - umbrellas too if you need one.One spot to try is Pearl's Burgers right across the street from the hotel. This place is on the local's SFGate site for bargain eats in the city ([--]) that my cousin pointed me to. While we were there the place was always full and so we gave it a shot. It's great for some comfort food after a night on the town. ',GOOD,
'Great Stay- Great Location- Great Hotel Stayed on November 2-4. Celebrated a friends birthday with 6 people. Reserved a suite which has 2 queen beds and a murphy bed. Very nice room, clean, small kitchen. Best of all was the location and price. just a couple of minutes walk to union square and some great restaurants. The neighborhood was not bad at all. Felt very safe there. Breakfast was fine . Overall, i highly recommend this hotel for it's location and price. ',GOOD,
'Great Budget Priced Hotel in San Francisco This is a very nice, inexpensive (for San Francisco) hotel. I spent one night there recently and was pleasantly surprised at the charming lobby and very clean room. I paid $139.00 per night, including taxes. Wine and cheese were available in the lobby in the late afternoo, at no additional charge. A continental breakfast was also included although I did not try it. The hotel is located just three blocks from Union Square and is about 7 blocks from the BART. I was there on business but observed several tourists seemingly getting good assistance at the front desk. The staff were very pleasant. I would stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Above Average Stayed for 2 nights in a family suite.Pros - Large  clean room, comfortable bed, very good service, free breakfast  afternoon wine/cheese, extremely reasonable honour bar prices in room, proximity to Union Square, lots of options for dining in the immediate area (be it restaurants, take-away's or convinience stores), reasonable rates compared to similar hotels in the area.Cons - noise from street  adjacent rooms noticeable but got used to it.Overall a very nice hotel providing good service in a good location at reasonable rates. Would stay here again without hesitation. ',GOOD,
'Good value Found the room in this hotel to be clean although the lobby did have a slight smell of urine (Not in rooms). Asked for an upgrade on booking and received a room with two king beds and ample room; room with single king bed is alot smaller. Room clean although bathroom a bit tired. Bed comfortable, no air con but fan provided (bit noisy), no view. Staff helpful but not overly friendly. Breakfast provided - pastries, muffins, fresh fruit, nice coffee. Served in pleasant area. Wine and cheese also complimentary in afternoons but we didnt partake.Location was handy - short walk downhill to Union Square and cable cars ($5 to travel one way eg to Fishermans Wharf). Convenience store just over road and also very nice Thai restaurant. Super Shuttle from airport was $20 ($16 + tip).Booked through travel agent but had found good internet special so booked that ($119/night). Be aware that rate is in US dollars and does not include tax. Parking is expensive at hotel - we picked up rental car after stay in San Fran - public transport is readily available. Avis is one block down Post st. Able to leave luggage at front desk on day of check out and retreive later in day.Overall positive experience. ',GOOD,

'Customer Service wins at BA Hotel - Long-winded Left my wallet at the Burbank Airport Terminal on my way to San Fran for a weekend getaway.. I returned to the airport on a Monday only to learn that SW had fedex'd it [not overnight like i had requested]My wallet conveniently arrived at the BA Hotel that Tuesday and they called to notify. Fedex advised that I couldn't schedule a pickup without an account so I asked Bob if he could take the wallet , repackage and send to me. Bob agreed without hesitation however it would have to wait until the other person came in to relieve him.I got a call back from David, who confirmed that he sent the package. He said that he couldn't pay with my CC so he used the company card and they would charge me through the hotel system. Furthermore, two maintenance issues that came up during our stay [one issue we notified the hotel of, the other was fixed before we said anything] were taken care of promptly.For a bargain hotel in the middle of downtown that is still pricey for what it is [what hotel isn't in that vicinity], their handling of customer service is superb. They do not let their slightly outdated hotel serve as an excuse to provide outdated customer service. I travel frequently for work and, by nature, have frequent bizarre mishaps that require extra service from hotels - I was pleasantly surprised that the BA Hotel matched the service many other chain hotels. They still provide a nice afternoon social hour and complimentry pastries/coffees for breakfast if you're on the run, on a budget, or insist on getting your money's worth. There is a great breakfast/lunch place one block east at Taylor, The Crepe House. ',POOR,
'Spacious Room! Our family of 4 stayed in a Parlor Suite. We were there with two other families, who also had Parlor Suites. The Suites were great! The bedroom had two very comfortable queen beds and the living room had a comfy murphy bed. Lots of closet space, although more hangers would have been good. Lots of drawers to store your stuff if you don't like living out of a suitcase. We didn't use the kitchen for any cooking, but it was definitely nice to have the fridge and freezer for storing stuff and the microwave to heat up left overs. The honor bar prices were very reasonable. The bathroom was HUGE, with a great jacuzzi tub/shower and two sinks at the counter. Our bathroom didn't have any under counter storage, but our friends' rooms did. The continental breakfast was a nice starter. There is a little convencience store across the street to get some milk, yogurt, cereal, fruit, etc. if you want more. Across the street is a delicious Italian restaurant and wonderful Thai restaurant!We would definitely consider staying there again if we ever return to San Fran. ',GOOD,
'Good location, fine hotel for the price Close to Union Square, clean, inexpensive, full of old San Francisco charm, but definitely not a luxury hotel. However, if you expect to be active and looking for a decent, inexpensive place to crash, you can't go wrong.Within walking distance to the cable car, China Town, Union Square, and Little Italy (a bit longer walk).A quaint little restaurant - which is not bad for a hotel restaurant - serves a free continental breakfast in the morning.Two important notes:- No airconditioning. With the mild San Francisco summers and breezes coming through the large double-hung windows this is generally not a problem - unless you hit a heatwave. The hotel puts a large floor fan in each room.- Pretty noisy during the day (starting around 6am) on the street side. Unfortunately, the best rooms are on the street side. So I guess the moral of the story is, this is a great hotel for active tourists, not so great for late sleepers. ',POOR,
'Good price, clean place, decent location, too close to shady neighborhood though Stayed there for 7 days. The hotel was definitely a decent price. The place was very clean. It definitely had an old look to it - older furniture, 1 old looking elevator, the vending machines had coke/sprite cans from the 80s. Checking in and out was a breeze. On the plus side, we got there a little after noon, and our room was ready right away, which was nice. There's 2 computers in the lobby, which was nice for checking email or websites. The continental breakfast is only pastries, croissaints, fruit, coffee, and tea. It's good for grabbing something in the morning if you're off to be somewhere early. But if you're looking for more of a breakfast meal, you'd need to go elsewhere. A place called Dottie's True Blue Cafe is not far from there, and had a great breakfast - you just have to wait in line for a while though!!! We waited about 45 mins.They had a wine and cheese hour everyday. We managed to make it there for one time. It was really cute. They had red and white wines, and crackers and various cheeses. There was also cookies and tea.A very big downside to the hotel was there were about 5 TV channels in our room. While we're not on vacation to just stay in the room and watch TV, at night when we got back, we did want to relax and maybe be able to watch something good/have a selection. I'm a huge TV person. I believe they basically got NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, CW, Disney, ESPN, and Encore. Definitely not much of a selection.Even though San Fran is a breezy, cool area, the hotel was a bit stuffy (there's no AC). We slept with our windows open every night, and it was still stuffy. At least on the 2nd day, we found a fan in our closet, which we definitely used for the rest of the time there, which made it a little better. The windows had no screens on them so I was worried about getting bugs in the room, but I must admit, I did not see one bug in our room during our stay, with the windows wide open. We had requested a room away from Post St - because the rooms that face Post are noisier. They honored our request, and I believe we were facing a courtyard. The only bad thing was the first day or two there, we heard some people yelling loudly, singing loudly, etc. We figured the noise must have been coming from a hostel which was located next door to our hotel. It was a close distance to the heart of Union Square, and the cable car turnaround. However, I did feel extremely uncomfortable at night when returning to the hotel. The seedy Tenderloin district is only blocks away, so there's definitely strange people and a lot of homeless hanging around at night. Plus, one night when we took the bus back to the area, the block we had to get off at to walk up to the hotel was even closer to the Tenderloin, and there were some shady people hanging out, so that was scary. I read a few travel books, and usually they mentioned when a hotel was too close to the Tenderloin. None of the books mentioned this as being very close to it, so I figured it'd be ok. I wish they would've said that while it was safe there, it is somewhat close to it so it can be a bit creepy. I found as we walked more towards the wharf when we were sightseeing, there was less and less homeless to deal with. By our hotel there were tons of homeless, so that was definitely annoying.There really weren't too many food places right there, another downside. At times we were exhausted after being out all day, and would want to grab something to eat close to the hotel. But due to the fact that there wasn't a huge selection of places to go around by the hotel, we just ate at places in the other neighborhoods which we were at for the day, like North Beach, the Wharf, etc. There was a little mini-mart type of store across the street, which was great for grabbing a bag of chips or snacks. Getting around was definitely easy, so that was a plus. We were not too far from the cable cars or F line or the bus, so that was good. However, San Fran is a pretty small city, so getting around from anywhere probably isn't difficult. Basically, if you're on a budget, not into being around a bunch of tourists, just want a clean place and bed to sleep in, then this would be a good place. The place is nice, but I think I'm someone who's more into newer hotels. Personally, next time I go, I'd probably stay by the Wharf. There are more tourists there, and considering I am a tourist, I'd rather be around more people like myself. Plus, there's more places near the wharf for tourists, like fast food places if you need to grab a quick bite to eat. ',POOR,
'Great Place to stay My husband, myself and our two teenage children just spend 4 great nights at this hotel. It is old but well maintain and clean with lots of character. It is centrally located within walking distance of Union Square, China Town and the Cable Cars. I found the rooms large, ours had what was called a wet bar which meant there was a sink, small fridge, microwave and even a toaster. I found the toaster handy as the continental breakfast was pastries and fruit. My teenagers loved the pastries. They offer wine and cheese in the lobby each afternoon which was wonderful for re-grouping and meeting other travellers. We had a room on the street side and the street noise starts early but is nothing more than city noise. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to SF. ',GOOD,
'CREEPY Bellman, Very Agressive Be Careful...but nice, clean hotel nice, clean hotel. centrally located to a lot. however, as a single woman traveling I was very disturbed by the bellman's behavior. Marvin was very helpful while checking me in. when I ran into him on the street one day he practically strong armed me to dinner. he was very, very aggressive. from that point on I really tried to stay away and make all contact brief and professional. I didn't want to c complain because it was a month long stay for me. Marvin even knocked on my room's door, completely un-ivited. he said that if i needed him for anything he was there for me. Eewwww! even while checking my email in the lobby he would hover. i quickly realized that I needed to be unfriendly and that seemed to work. so this was my only issue with my stay. i'm sure he hits on all women traveling alone. Gross! sad becasue the hotel was lovely and very clean. good bargain too. just be careful of MARVIN. ',POOR,
'Good value for price! The Beresford Arms is an older hotel near Union Square which has been very well maintained. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Buildings.The rooms are large by San Francisco standards. We stayed in a queen/queen junior suite complete with full kitchen (which we did not use) and a large bathroom with double sinks and whirlpool bath. The bathroom while clean would benefit from an upgrade. The furniture was fine and overall the room was very clean. One significant downside is the fact that the hotel does not have air conditioning. Despite our being in a room facing the courtyard (a must) we still had significant street noise from sirens and people singing in the streets. The room would benefit from a ceiling fan to help cool the room and circulate the air (a window fan is available). Overall, this is a good find for the price. I would caution families traveling with very small children. The hotel is in a fringe area. Just 2-3 blocks west and you are in a less savory area. Then again, 2 blocks south and you are in the middle of Union Square staring at Macy's! ',POOR,
'Never stayed..But, they like to charge you anyway! Booked this hotel back in February for a May visit. They gave us a confirmation number. Called and cancelled on 3/13 and asked for a cancellation number..They said they don't use them, but assured me that it would be cancelled. This month, the charge appeared on my MasterCard! Nice, huh ',POOR,
'Great find! The BAH is an older, elegant Hotel close to Union Square.The rooms are spacious with kingsize beds, kitchenette, bath and jacuzzi.Everything is very clean.The hotel is an old er one, so the decor is elegant-old-fashioned, which I found nice.They offer a self-service breakfast of fruits as well as croissants/bagels and coffee/tee in the lounge as well as free internet - access on 2 computers.I would definateley stay there again any time. ',GOOD,
'Bereford Arms Was Lovely I highly recommend the Bereseford Arms in San Francisco. It is downtown, just a few blocks from Union Square and within walking distance of SFMoma and great restaurants. Actually, there's a great Indonesian restaurant directly across the street on Post Road.My room was on the small side, and there was a shower instead of a bath, but the shower included a foot-massage-jacuzzi, and the room was tastefully adorned, with perfect clean fluffy towels. Also, the staff was nice, and the lobby was great. They serve wine and cheese and tea in the afternoons for a little over an hour and are not at all stingy but rather keep trying to refill your wine glasses. The lobby includes two computers with internet access, available for guest use without charge. In many ways, the hotel interior felt a little old-fashioned but in a really nice way. My room was $119 with AAA. ',GOOD,
'Fine place to stay for th eprice We stayed here for a weekend girl's trip. It is definitely an older hotel, but our room had two pretty comfy queen beds, a kitchenette, and a jacuzzi tub. The rooms were old and a little rough around the edges, but spacious and most importantly: clean. I was in a room not facing the street, and it was very quiet. Our friends were in a room facing the street, so they had quite a bit of street noise, and they complained about water pipe noise as well, which we didn't hear. The have two free computers in the lobby, plus WIFI and comfy chairs in the lobby. Breakfast was nice (donuts, pasty, fruit, coffee, tea) but won't wow you. (There is a tasty crepery down the street). The wine in the afternoons is a nice touch, and they even let me take my glass upstairs so I could drink wine and soak in the jacuzzi tub. Oh, the honor bar prices were very reasonable, as well.The location was great for us. We took Bart from Oakland airport to the Powell street station, then walked to the hotel (we each only had a small bag). We had no trouble walking to the Ferry Building Farmer's market, chinatown, or fisherman's wharf from the hotel. There are plenty of bus stops nearby, for those who aren't walkers. We ran into some panhandlers when we were walking around at night, but we never felt unsafe.Cons: I don't think they have air conditioners, which could ba a problem sometimes (we kept our window open all night in early march to keep a breeze going), the staff wasn't terribly friendly, but they weren't bad. If I was going to San Fran for a fancy smancy romantic weekend, I might choose a different hotel, but this place was a very good choice for a weekend with friends. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel - highly recommend! My mom and I stayed in Beresford Arms last August and we really enjoyed it. It is older hotel but very clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was big, with little kitchen (full size fridge, oven and microwave!). Bathroom was huge, too. Shower had great massaging shower head - great body relief after all day sightseeing. You could book your tours through hotel if you want, but I booked ours before our trip to San Francisco via Internet. I walked to Chinatown from this hotel - about 10-15 min, and I didn't feel this walk was dangerous at 9 p.m. We also walked from the hotel all the way to Fisherman's Wharf - quite a walk, but very pleasant! Union square is just a couple of minutes away, too.Every morning we had delicious breakfast in the lobby - lots of fruits, pastries, muffins, etc. I liked their coffee and tea, too. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family - if you are not too picky about staying in older hotel, this is a great place to rest your bones after full day of sightseeing. TravelgirlOH ',GOOD,
'Agree, it's a great value. Yes, it is an older hotel and it shows in some of the rooms with some nicked furniture and somewhat smaller rooms, but it was all very clean and you would be hard pressed to be the location and rate. The lobby is small by very nicely appointed with many conversation areas, we loved the nightly wine and cheese gatherings as it gave us a chance to relax inbetween outings and meet other people, the matching continental breakfast is also very pleasant. The staff was very friendly and helpful with out questions about touring the city.Our room was initially on the 6th floor facing Post, avoid this if you can as it tends to have a great deal of traffic noise, we asked and were moved to the back of the hotel without any problems. The room had 2 queen beds, a small sitting area and closet, dresser, entertainment console which held the TV and small mini bar (which is great for stocking your own beverages, there is a small market across the street). The bath had an enclosed tub with double sink vanity, there is no hair dryer but plenty of soaps, shampoos and conditioner. There is no air conditioning but the days and nights were very cool and we were never uncomfortable.It is only 4 short blocks to Union Square and from there you can get to anyplace in the city.We greatly enjoyed our staff and would visit again! ',GOOD,
'Very pleased! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in September along with my parents. We are in our mid 40's and my parents are in their mid 60's. We were VERY pleasantly surprised with this hotel. We didn't request rooms together but they very considerately had already assigned them to us. Our rooms were clean and well appointed. The room my husband and I stayed in had a walk in closet, a kitchenette and a large deep tub. We got our rooms for $99.00 a night! The rooms weren't air conditioned and it was a little warm for us since we had such beautiful September weather. They did provide fans though so it was fine at night. We are both very hot natured and had been concerned about that - but it really wasn't much of a problem and from what I've heard about typical San Francisco weather it is probably unusual to be hot at all. There was a free continental breakfast and coffee in the mornings and a computer available for free in the lobby. The staff was friendly and helpful in giving us directions and the location was great. We didn't have a car so we either walked or took a cab everywhere we went. The only problem I had was the walking directions from the BART station where very hard for me to figure out. Plus - with luggage that's a pretty long walk up a few steep hills. I would recommend grabbing a cab if you're coming from BART - I think it was less then $10 with the tip - and well worth it! ',GOOD,
'A Great Find My wife and i stayed at this hotel 13-15 Oct 2006. We arrived much earlier than the allocated check in time ,but this was no problem as the very helpful staff booked us in straight away. We were very satified with our room-plenty of space,full kitchen,loads of hanging space,good sized bed and very clean.Although on a main road nighttime noise was not overly intrusive.A five minute walk to union square with all it's attractions was an added bonus.For those more adventurous the walk to fishermans wharf is pretty tough but the stunning views make it very worthwhile. Be warned though that if you go via jones st. this has three of the ten steepest hills in the city! A nice touch at the hotel is the afternoon cheese and wine gathering which is complimentary and a good place to exchange experiences with other guests. The fridge in the room was well stocked with alcoholic and soft drinks that we found to be very reasonably priced. We had dinner at the sister hotel just around the corner and found it to be very good.Go early though,you are unlikely to be seated after 9.00 p m All in all a very enjoyable stay. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Location and Good Rate I have been to San Franscisco many times. I found this hotel from reading Frommer's book. We stayed 2 nights and it was not a bad experience at all. The location is very good and walkable to the Chinatown and the cable cars to go to other places. We did not have any problems walking out at night and found some nice restaurants nearby in the evening. Overall, the hotel was good. If you are not so picky and like some comfort and quaint elegance, this is a great hotel. ',GOOD,
'The Beresford is how I define value Like you I've stayed in a lot of places looking for that inexpensive place that is pleasant to stay in. You don't spend many waking hours in a hotel. Why overspend for it? Many of them I picked from guide book recommendations - and after you check in, you wonder if the hotel was paying off the book publisher. I picked the Beresford after reading on-line reviews. That seems to work. You won't mistake the Beresford for a five star hotel, but it is a five star value. If you can afford $500 a night, there are better, and better located, places in San Francisco. But we liked the Beresford. It was a pleasant suprise. It was clean, roomy, well appointed and comfortable. We had a quiet room with 2 queen beds and we used their valet parking - for a few dollars less than $200 total per day. In downtown San Francisco - that's how I define value. ',GOOD,

'Stayed for a Family Wedding We traveled from Minnesota to San Francisco for my daughters wedding. Most of the guests stayed at the Beresford Arms, we were able to secure reasonable rates for all the travelers. The staff was very helpful in getting us transportation whenever needed and usually within short notice. The continental breakfast was great especially as we were always on a tight schedule. All of the guests that were part of our reservation received white roses in their rooms as a thank-you was a nice touch. We stayed in the parlour suite and had plenty of room to prepare for all the wedding activites. The hotel was within walking distance to Union square and we were able to take bus or taxi to the Wharf. The rooms are dated but clean - could use new carpet but overall we enjoyed our stay would stay again. ',GOOD,
'Beresford Arms is OK After reading the reviews about Beresford Arms, I was hesitant to stay there. However, I wanted to stay in a classic, San Francisco hotel with charm. I was surprised at how pleasant it actually was. It was somewhat difficult using the valet service at first. It wasn't well- marked. However, once we got that, it was fine, and they were always prompt with the car. The room was a decent size with a lovely bay window. The decor was a bit dated and shabby, but seemed reasonably clean. The bathroom was, again, reasonably clean. We were only there one night, so we didn't go out much. I was somewhat worried about the neighborhood considering reviews I had previously read, but I think it is ok. I wouldn't be out really late at night. Overall, it is a good value. I don't think I could spend a week there, but one or two nights would be ok. ',POOR,
'Great stay in the Beresford Arms We stayed for 2 nights in the Beresford Arms, was the last part of our three weeks' honeymoon in the U.S.With a price of $152 per night, which is very reasonable for San Francisco standards, we were very happy. Although the website looks great, in all honesty, the rooms in real life are pretty old-fashioned. It all has a real 70's feel to it. Pro's:- junior suite is very large, with old kitchen and bathroom but all works well- very quiet, no noise from street- location: we did not find the area bad at all! san francisco has a lot of homeless people, but virtually none in the area of the hotel. it is only a 8 minute walk to Union Square and there are a lot of restaurants in the area.- extremely helpful, though slightly aloof front desk- valet parking fast and not too expensive for city standards ($20)Con's:- no internet access in room, only in hotel lobby- breakfast very simple- no airconditioning (but did not need this either in mid-July)Overall: great stay in central San Francisco, personally we did not mind the old-fashioned rooms. Everything works, is there if you need it. You're in SF to view the city anyway! We did have a car (roundtrip) and even though everybody says you don't need it in SF, we found it helpful and it certainly allowed us to see the city in under 3 days.Would definitely stay again! ',GOOD,
'Very nice Hotel We recently stayed for 5 nights at the Beresford Arms, following recommendations on Trip Advisor and were very pleased with our stay. With 2 teenagers we had booked a 2 room parlour suite which was very spacious, clean and had a kitchenette and v large bathroom (including Jacuzzi Bath). The staff were very helpful and the free wine and cheese and breakfast buffet were a nice touch. As in most areas of SF, sirens and early morning refuse collection could be heard but we were usually that tired that it did not bother us. I would definately recommend the Beresford Arms as a great place to stay. ',GOOD,
'Great Vintage Hotel at a convenient location The Beresford Arms is a charming Hotel located about 5 blocks from Union Square. Many of the other Boutique Hotels I saw on our vacation had very tiny lobbies or just a front desk, but this hotel had a beautiful lobby with internet access and plenty of seating. The front desk staff were friendly and and always pleasant. The room we stayed in was a junior suite which is basically a regular hotel room, but it also had a separate kitchenette (full size frig., microwave, stove, utensils, plates, honor bar, etc.). The bathroom was very large with a double sink area and plenty of counter space. The hot water was a little unpredictable but not a major concern. Beds were fine however the TV was pretty limited. I think they had about 10 channels to choose from. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, and an assortment of pasteries and fresh fruit cut up and whole. I wish they had juice or milk. I was able to stock up on snack items and drinks for the convenience store across street. At first glance it does not look too nice from the outside and would really question their hot food but it was just fine for packaged and dairy foods as well as drinks - milk, soda, beer and wine. We also ordered in from the Italian restaurant and Pearl's hamburgers also right across street. Both were good choices. We took the MUNI buses all around the city and we were always able to end up in Union Square for a short walk back to the hotel. We also took several Gray Line Bus tours and they picked up as well as dropped us off directly infront of our hotel. I would difinitely return to the Beresford Arms. Hope this helps. ',GOOD,
'Wasnt that bad... There were some things I found charming about this hotel and some that I found could have used some improvement. Overall, my experience wasnt bad. Let's start with the pro's: 2 blocks from Union Square, good sized bathroom with whirpool jet baths, small clean kitchen area in suites with utensils and stove, free internet in the lobby, continental breakfast, front desk was very helpful @ helping me find a number of eateries and directions to places. Cons: sketchy part of town (Dont walk around at night alone, day is ok just stick to Post St and the areas surrounding Union Square), Carpet needed cleaning. I had a comfy stay at the Beresford Arms and people who arent too picky would enjoy it as well. ',POOR,
'Great price for SF We thought the price of $124 a night was great for San Francisco. We found our room to be clean and free of any unpleasant smells. Our bed was ok but the pillows very uncomfortable. We were on the 6th floor and our windows were not facing either of the busy streets but we still slept with them closed because of the noise. ',POOR,
'This hotel is a disaster! Stay away. This hotel is a disaster! Stay away! We arrived at 5:00 a.m. because our flight was delayed. The front door was locked. There is a bell outdoors and we rang it for 5 minutes, no one came! Our cabby used his cell phone to call the front desk. It had to ring several minutes until some answered. A young man came to the door and let us in. He was sleepy and not the least bit concerned that we had been waiting in what is an unsafe area of the city. This was just the start of our terrible stay. We found out it was unsafe by witnessing 2 drug arrests during the day a block away from the hotel.The hotel itself is old and not well kept. The rooms are small. There is no air conditioning and it was very warm. The furniture is uncomfortable and dusty. The hotel is located on a main street and you can hear sirens going off often during the day and night! The staff is not helpful and cleaning is not done often. Our room was never picked up during our stay. They did make the bed but they did not pick up the used glasses from the snack bar (or anything else for that matter). The front desk is not helpful or concerned about your well being. I know this hotel is a bargain but I don't believe that it is worth it. There really isn't a good thing I can say. ',POOR,
'Beresford Arms is OK for the Price My husband and I have been traveling in CA for the last 3 weeks. We stayed at Beresford Arms for four nights in July. Yes, this hotel is a good deal for San Fran, but may not be worth your money. Pros:It is near Union Sq., the cable car line, and an Avis Car rental. They have 2 computers with fast, free Internet. There was a breakfast of danishes, donuts, and some fruit provided. We ate it to save a little $, not because it was delicious.Cons:Our Non Smoking room reeked of smoke, especially in the bathroom. Our room faced Post St. and was VERY noisy. The room was clean, but not comfortable. We barely slept the entire time we were there due to the uncomfortable bed, horrible pillows and noise. The great mini bar prices were not accurate; the $2.00 Pringles came to $4.00 on our bill. Although very close to Union Sq., it is not a nice part of town. We walked around a bit one night, and quickly found our way back to the hotel. If you're traveling for a vacation, consider paying a little extra for a nicer hotel. This bargain hotel put a bit of a damper on our San Francisco trip. We wish we had spent more on a nicer hotel in a better part of town. ',POOR,
'Perfect bargain for the family We stayed in rooms 611 and 612, in the 6B corner of the hotel for a week. The mini bars were actually affordable which is a real boon if you're travelling with children and teens. Also, there is a Whole Foods Market about 10 minutes away to fill up the fridge with healthy snacks and fruit.We were near everything in Union Square. While we quickly discovered not to walk down Jones Street for any reason (except for Dottie's True Blue Cafe) because of the large numbers of assertive/aggressive homeless people, walking down Post to go to Powell was never a problem. If you tire of taking cabs everywhere, there is a bus that runs down Powell as well - the staff is very helpful with travel tips.611 was the suite with two queen beds, full kitchen (fridge, freezer, microwave, coffeemaker, pots, plates, pans), bidet, and whirlpool bath - a delight. 612 had a single double bed and simple bathroom - none of the extras of 611, but he combination of the two rooms in 6B was PERFECT for our family. We left the doors to 611 and 612 open and closed the door to 6B.The rooms were very clean. Because we have dust mite allergies in our family, it is imperative that all sheets be washed in super hot water. Even though the hotel did not have hypoallergenic pillows, no one had any allergy attacks because the sheets were sterile.The hotel was lovely and quiet and the rooms were large - apparently a rarity in SF hotels. The morning coffee, fruit and donut situation was lovely, although the coffee was pretty weak (along with everywhere in SF but Starbucks). The evening wine with cheese and dates was nice as well, particularly if you have time before dinner. The hotel attracts a lot of European guests and these communal times were genuinely friendly.The daytime staff were kind and well informed with information about bonded babysitters should you need, as well as fairly thorough information about the city at large. The evening staff was not as well informed, but still kind.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't want to pay top dollar to stay at one of the finer hotels but still wants a nice room and good service. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Gem in The City This hotel is wonderful! Most importantly my family and I had another hotel booked and when we arrived it was awful. We literaly walked around the corner to this hotel and were warmly welcomed and the staff worked dillegently to find us a room and to make us feel special which they accomplished. Rooms are spacious and clean and the continental breakfast was always fresh and delicious. I will most definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Worst hotel have ever ever stayed in Goiing back over the reviews of the Beresford Arms I feel like I was in an entirely different place. In over 25 years of business and personal travel, and at a variety of price points, this was by far the worst, most horrible hotel l I have ever stayed in. I booked via the Internet, where the rooms were completely misrepresented. I booked a junior suite -- what I got was a standard room with two queen size beds. The kitchen area was gross, the linoleum in the bathroom was old, cracked, with many holes from burns. The carpet in the bedroom was so filty that even the bellman who helped with my luggage (although I insisted I could handle it myself) suggested that I call down to the desk to complain. The desk couldn't care less. For the first time in my life I left a hotel, am absolutely refusing to pay a penny for this dump. Also, I work with a number of people who live in San Francisco and they told me today that the area where this hotel is located is VERY dangerous after dark. Do not stay here, no matter how cheap the price. It's not worth it to be anywhere this totally disgusting. ',POOR,
'Beresford Arms, Value for Money A room in downtown San Francisco can be quite expensive. But Beresford Arms Hotel gave our family value for our money. We stayed for 6 nights( May 2006) in their Parlor Room and WOW, it was immaculately clean. It had a full working kitchen  whirpool. The staff from the doorman to the cleaning lady were all efficient  couteous. Most importantly, NO MUSTY ROOM SMELL. This boutique hotel gives free continental breakfast buffet to guest in their lobby each morning as well as wine and cheese at 6pm evey night. It is walking distance to the Union Square, bus stops, the F line, and shops. There is also a convenient store in front. We will definitely stay in Beresford Arms when we vacation again in San Francisco. ',GOOD,
'Great Value, Comfortable Accommodations The Bereseford Arms offers travelers to San Francisco great value, comfortable rooms and a lot of charm. This hotel does not rip you off, for instance, with outlandish prices for bottled water or beer in the minibar -- $1.25 for water, $2 for a beer. The hotel also provides free high speed Internet access on two computers in the lobby. The complimentary continental breakfast consists of coffee, fruit, danish and croissants and there is wine nd cheese in the lobby from 4 to 5 pm each day. The staff is helpful and hospitable. The rooms are clean and comfortable and include TV, ironing board and iron and in some a kitchenette. The location, on Post Street, several blocks from Union Square is convenient, and provides a neighborhood experience, as opposed to a downtown' or touristy epxerience. We met a lot of repeat guests during our stay and that tells of the quality and value this hotel provides. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel We were really happy with the Beresford Arms. The neighbourhood is not great but only three blocks to the cable car line and Union Square. It is an old building with a great ambience. Our room was huge with a large bathroom and kitchen. Whilst there was no view it was very private due to deep window sills. The internet is free and fast and breakfast very basic yet adequate. It was extremely affordable (booked on line), would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Good Value The Beresford Arms is a very nice hotel and a great value. Our room was very large, it had two queen beds, a small kitchen, a large bathroom and a space for a couch! The prices there are also very reasonable. One nice extra is that they have a complimentary wine and cheese hour, a good opportunity to get to know the other guests in the beautiful lobby. The hotel is also conveniently located in the Union Square area, but off the main tourist street, so it is somewhat quieter. ',GOOD,
'GREAT HOTEL IN SAN FRANCISCO My wife and I spent three nights here in May.The staff are wonderful(5*).The location is execellent and the price was unbeatable. Extra perks included continental breakfast in the morning and cheese and wine in the afternoon.Highly recommend ',GOOD,
'Wow, what a great little hotel. My wife and I loved the hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was quiet (exactly what we asked for), the atmosphere was great and we both loved the old world charm of the histiric building. Great shopping nearby and an easy walk to most of downtown San Francisco.We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation. This is the second time my wife stayed at the Beresford and it was as a result of her first stay (10 years ago) that we decided to stay there this time, neither of us regretted that decision and we will certainly be staying there the next time we visit San Franciso.

'Great option for Downtown Stayed here for 3 nights in April 2006. Great value hotel for the location. We had a back facing room (616) which had no view, but was absolutely quiet at night. Recommended. ',GOOD,
'Good location, quiet, clean, safe I don't know if it's possible to pay less at any downtown SF hotel than the $115/night plus 14% tax I paid on a single at Beresford Arms, and still get the safety, cleanliness, and QUIET I got. I requested a quiet room in the back and was on the 8th floor, away from the street. True, I had a view of the backsides of buildings, but it was so quiet I almost thought I was the only person in the hotel. The beds were perfectly OK, and I was never awakened by outside lights or noise. It's a 5 minute walk to Union Square; 10-15 minutes to Chinatown. I was very satisfied/ ',GOOD,
'The Beresford is a good hotel Stayed at the Beresford for 3 nights in Sept 06. We were really pleased, it's a good hotel in a good location. If you are on a budget and can't afford 拢100 + a night which many of the hotels are, stay here. It's a beautiful old building, pretty well kept. The rooms are large and it's great to have a fridge and kettle. In the morning there's complimentary coffee,pastries and fruit in the foyer and free internet. The staff are helpful too. I would definately stay here again. Don't forget to check out Bobby C's Owl Bar on Post street on your way back from a hard days sight seeing. ',GOOD,
'What a great place to stay! We had a wonderful time at the Beresford Arms. Union Square is just a few blocks away. The room was clean and the staff was wonderful. The attached kitchen was very handy, it allowed us to eat some meals in the room and save our money for fantastic dinners on the town. It's not the height of luxury but it is charming and more than met our needs. We slept like babies. The afternoon wine and cheese event was very nice. We will no doubt make it our new San Francisco destination. ',GOOD,
'This hotel would be great, except for the fact that it's impossible to sleep. Picture in your mind if you will: Two people in deep sleep, dreaming of their active day in S.F. Suddenly, a fire truck comes charging up right outside your window, sirens blazing, lights fill your room like a spotlight in the night. Eventually, your mind and body adapts to this nuance and you fall back asleep. Some 15 minutes later, an incredibly loud fire alarm goes off. You put on every single piece of clothing and begin heading down stairs with the rest of the tired, alarmed guests. Before you get to the lobby staff informs you that everything is ok now and we apologize and go ahead and get back in bed and fall asleep. You say, thank god and jump back into bed. As you just begin your 3rd jaunt into slumber, the alarm goes off again. Approximately 22 minutes after the last alarm. It is now 6:38 AM. Again, you put back on your clothes, head down to the lobby and proceed to wait in the lobby in your PJ's until the SFFD comes and somehow turns off the fire alarm. The staff again assures you that you can now go back to bed. Sure, right, mmmmhmm. This is my story --- one that occured on 12/30/05. I understand that alarms go off and things happen. As a former bay area resident, I fully understand that the city, especially Union Square, are loud. But this hotel is LOUD. The walls are thin. I dont care what anyone tells me, my standards are very low. This hotel is loud. It's too bad, because the staff, given these situations, was rather friendly, and the rooms, while old and somewhat unkempt, were ok and somewhat clean. The shower was the most erratic contraption I have ever seen. It would go from blazing hot to frigid cold quicker than I could snap my fingers. I feel a little strange making these complaints, given that I paid $102 a night. I dont know that you'll find much cheaper in the area. Unfortunately, I still felt a little ripped off come check out time. I know some people love this hotel, I just don't get it. I wasn't looking for shangri-la, just sleep. ',POOR,
'Wonderful Gem in the City!!! We were originally booked at their sister hotel a few blocks over and due to overbookings they moved us here to this lovely little hotel. It was an upgrade from what we were going to pay for the room, but the hotel was very pretty. It is old, and appropriately decored to fit it. We actually had the first room on the first floor, I was worried about noise from the lobby but found more noise to come from the outside streets. The hotel is walking distance to downtown Union Square and nearby galleries and other shopping. Staff was friendly and the room had a jet tub and a bidet. The room was very roomy and the beds were the worst of it, very hard and not comfortable at all. Other than the HORRIBLE beds, the hotel was great and we definately if needed, would stay here again. It is very centerally located within the city. ',GOOD,
'Great place for vacationers I highly recommend this hotel for leisure travelers. It is well-located near Union Square. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My room was small, but had unexpected architectural features that made it charming. There is a small continental breakfast in the lobby, and an afternoon wine and cheese buffet. And clean--I even saw someone washing off the sidewalk in front of the hotel! This hotel is probably not for business travelers, since it does not have a business center, and the only internet connection is in the lobby.If you like Marriots and Radissons, this hotel is not for you. But if you want a clean, friendly, charming place to stay while you're on vacation, this is a wonderful choice. ',GOOD,
'Home for the Holidays We have stayed at the niche, the boutique and the 5 star hotels and KEEP coming back to the Beresford Arms.This is our 3rd time there this year! If you are expecting turn down service, down comforters and fancylotions and potions in the bathroom, this is not the place for you....! If it is comfortable, clean, non-pretentious, same smiling faces year after year..this is it! Some of the old chairs in the lobby are from 1910, when it was an apartment home! It is lovingly taken care of.Our room was a Jr. Suite with a large bathroom andkitchenette (which we never used). This time we brought family and they used the jacuzzi tub to soothetheir aching bodies from our long hilly walks.The coffe in the lobby is great and the sweets and rolls and fruit tide you over until you walk to breakfast. The wine and cheese hour is a good time tounwind. We recognized a young couple we met there twoyears ago on this Thanksgiving weekend. It feels like home to them as well. They are dog friendly...people friendly and pocket book friendly... ',GOOD,
'Great location Really mixed reviews lately for this hotel.We stayed here at the start of Nov on the first stage of our honeymoon. We found the hotel to be absolutely fine. GREAT location, good prices, great pastries for breakfast. It's not a 5* hotel clearly and yes, the decor has seen better days but our room was spotlessly clean and we thought the shiny wallpaper had a bit of a retro chic thing going on. San Fran is full of expensive hotels - this is a bargain!! ',GOOD,
'"Sorry but I hated it..." I had booked the Beresford Arms on the back of TripAdvisor for 4 night in October as the 'finale' to our 2 week holiday. The rate via Expedia was very good and we had a junior suite.. I know now why they only have 1 photo on the web site. Our room was at the front and exceptionally noisy with what looked like months of pigeon 'poo' outside our window and some very sick looking pigeons. It was very warm but you really wouldn't want to open the window even if the noise allowed you too. The room was not nice... every seat had some sort of stain on it, the edge of the carpet had never been hoovered and was thick with dust, the kitchen had chipped crockery and smelt, the bathroom... I would not have dared used the jacuzzi, the wallpaper was straight out of the 60's, the taps were gold many years ago and one sink had two cold taps even though one was hot!.. the hallway smelt...shall I go on? I'm sorry but maybe for the money I got what I paid for but we stayed there one night and I was so upset that we had to move to another hotel costing us more money that we couldn't really afford. I didn't want to stay at the Hilton... I didn't expect a 5 star hotel but I'm sorry to disagree with everyone it seems but this hotel was simply awful and I would not recommend it to anyone. ',POOR,
'Wonderful hotel Stayed here for two nights. Fab location, friendly professional staff, clean and comfortable rooms -with very reasonably priced minibar!Reasonably priced valet parking too.Would definately recommend and stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Mixed Reviews On the positive side, the hotel is in a central location, it is extremely inexpensive, the staff is friendly and helpful, the continental breakfast in the lobby is pleasant. I did not participate to the afternoon wine and cheese.I expected the room to be a bit worn, but did not expect it to be dirty. The curtains were filthy, the furniture had not been dusted, not sure the sheets had been changed as there were long, dark hairs on the pillows. I even had to wash the telephone before using it - dirty and sticky. All it needs is some soap, water and elbow grease to set it right. ',POOR,
'Very pleased with the Beresfor Arms Hotel This hotel offer great value, compared to other hotels in San Francisco that we checked.Very helpful and friendly staff. Only dissapointment was the breakfast which consisted of some greasy danish and coffee in plastic cups.The free wine hour from 5-6 pm was a very pleasant thing. And also free internet in the lobby.The room wasn't the largest I have stayed in, but comfortable beds and a good minibar. Large bathroom with jacuzzi, lovely!Would definately stay at the Beresford Arms again. ',GOOD,
'Why pay more? The Beresford Arms is great value. What you get for the money puts UK hotels to shame. It looks slightly shabby in a way that would only upset hardened perfectionists, and which Europeans would find charming and characterful - in contrast to the big chain US hotels. We requested, a room with a 'kitchenette', which turned out to be a full kitchen WITH a dining table for two, in its own adjoining room. The bathroom was huge; the bedroom huger. The staff were helpful without being overbearing, and the hotel made a very time-efficient base for visiting all parts of the city. The hotel is a few blocks from the edge of the Tenderloin, so if you want to avoid seeing large numbers of homeless/mentally ill people, head towards Union Square rather than more directly south towards Market St or the Civic Centre. But if you are upset by the sight of such people, you had best not go to San Francisco, because you can see them anywhere. Generally they seem too preoccupied, drunk or stoned to do more than ask for loose change: it did not feel menacing, just very sad that more is not being done to address the situation. If you like Indonesian food, the Indonesian restaurant voted the best in the city is right opposite, and very good - cheap too. ',GOOD,
'What a wonderful find Very nice hotel with first class rooms and ammenities. The location is close to Union square shops and restaurants. The breakfast was above average for a lobby continental. Staff were very curteous. Would definately stay again and recommend. Excellent value. ',GOOD,
'It doesn't need to be any better The first thing that I liked was that no one grabbed my suitcase to help me bring it to my room. I was asked whether I needed assistance; when I answered in the negative, I was left alone. That's how it was on departure as well. The room was clean and comfortable, with high quality soaps and shampoo. They even gave us a larger room at no extra cost so that I could be close to the suite that I reserved for my father and his caregiver. The complimentary fruit and sweet rolls in the morning were first rate; too bad, no capuccino, but the coffee was good. There was also tea and hot chocolate. No wireless in the hotel, but two computers in the lobby were free for e-mail and Internet. The free wine (house label) served with the cheeses in the afternoon was mediocre, but the host or hostess made up for it by making the atmosphere warm and family-like. The neighborhood isn't fancy, but okay, and if you enjoy walking, the hotel is conveniently located for getting to Union Square, the Civic Center, or the cable car. We spent four nights at the Beresford Arms, with absolutely nothing to complain about. Spending more elsewhere would just have been a waste of money. ',GOOD,
'Great value in a good location My partner and I stayed at the Beresford Arms for five nights recently. We made a reservation based on good tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Our room was very comfortable,clean, private and quiet. The breakfast in the lobby was an added bonus.The discounted price available when you book online makes this excellent value for such a central location. ',GOOD,
'Enjoyed my stay! The Hotel is confiniently located to the Union Square, which is only a few blocks away. Nevertheless the neighborhhod is very safe and I never felt threatend.The hotel itselfe exceeded my expectations. You get for a small price (compared to other S.F. hotels) a very big and clean room. Our room was equiped with one telephone and dataport, a TV with the major Bay Area TV stations, a desk, two comfortable queen size beds and a large bathroom with whirlpool.A minus are the very thin windows and walls. So if a firetrucks runs out along or you have loud neighbours it might become a bit loud.Between 7 and 10am you get a complimentary breakfast with some pastry, fresh fruits, coffee and tea.Between 4:30 and 5:30 pm there is a complimentary wine hour, which I didn't use.Unfortunally there is no WIFI in this hotel, but there are two free internet terminals in the lobby. So if you need a hotel in S.F. have a closer look on the Beresford Arms. ',GOOD,
'great hotel This hotel was a steal for the money. Large rooms, great service, free wine, and a short walk to Union Square. My wife and I will stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Charming Hotel My father and I visited San Francisco in early August. As I walked into the Beresford Arms Hotel I was taken by the elegantly furnished lobby. We were given a parlor suite on the top floor facing Post and Jones Streets. The rooms including the bathroom are spacious. Even though there is no air conditioning there are plenty of windows to open up to bring in fresh air. We found the continental breakfast to be adequate with coffee,juice, muffins,pastries,croissants, fresh fruits. The hotel is walking distance from most Union Square attractions as well as China Town. It can be a bit noisy at night since there is a fire station a few blocks away but I kept the windows closed during the night which muffled the outside sounds. Without a doubt I would stay at this hotel again for its price, charm and its nearness to Union Square. It's a hotel with a San Francisco personality. ',GOOD,
'Great location, nice hotel! I thought this hotel was a great deal. The service was good, the room was nice and the location was excellent. It is only about 6 blocks to union square and the big transportation hub on Powell and Market, and there were amazing places to eat all around the hotel. The rooms were clean, if a little dated, and the happy hour and breakfast were friendly and fun. The honor bar was a real deal -- $2.00 beers and $1.50 Calistogas! Imagine, an honor bar you can afford to use! My only real complaint is that there is no A/C and it is quite noisy if you sleep with the windows open (and stuffy if you sleep with them closed). Overall though, thumbs up for this little hotel! ',GOOD,
'Exceeded Expectations After reading mixed reviews I was not sure what to expect from this little hotel. From the moment I pulled up to the hotel, to the time I regretfully left, I was charmed. with one minor exception. David checked us in and was very pleasant. He noted it was our honeymoon and congratulated us. The room was simple yet tastfully decorated. There were little quarks to the room that I found fascintating, however this was my first trip to San Francisco so I cannot say if they were unique to the hotel or typical. There were big bay windows over looking the city with no screens!! They were covered by white billowy curtains. The bathroom had two sinks so we had plenty of room for our things. The best surprise came when I opened the closet. I had heard that most old hotels in Fricso had no a/cs so I was pleasantly suprised when if found a floor fan. Just as we were getting settled in, our stay got even better. David, who checked us in, brought up a bottle of champagne and two glasses. I was so excited. He was very helpful our entire stay. The only negative comment I have to make was about another clerk. We asked her to call Super Shuttle for a pick up. When she discovered that we were not going to use the company they have ties with she told me I could call from my room. I thought that was not very helpful. Other than that everything was great!! ',GOOD,
'Read the reviews here, decided to give it a try Traveled to San Francisco over fathers day in June and after reading the reviews here decided to give the Beresford Arms a try. It was as excellent as I had expected from reading all the reviews. It is a small hotel, but rooms are wonderful and it is well maintained. They had a small drawing for their guests for fathers day, and I actually won a tie. After spending 20 years in the hotel industry, housekeeping and building maintenance are the most important aspects of how a hotel is run, and both were excellent at the Beresford. Customer service is excellent as well. David at the front desk was extremely helpful in pointing us to wonderful restaurants and how to get around the city. I am looking forward to a return trip soon. By the way, the lack of air conditioning in June was not a problem, even though the days we stayed were sunny and unseasonably warm. ',GOOD,
'returning to our home in San Francisco We have been at the Gucci niche hotels and keep coming back to the comfortable Beresford Arms. It is just the friendly staff and comfy nonpretentious hotel that meets our needs. Walk to Union Square and even to N. Beach for a great dinner...We have stayed there for years and will continue to do so every time we visit the city. We came with friends and family..three Jr. Suites met theirneeds as well as ours..Our home away from home ',GOOD,
'Wonderful stay at the Beresford Arms We stayed at the Beresford Arms for 4 nights in June 2005. Although the hotel is rather old it has been maintained very well. We upgraded to a parlour suite on the eighth floor upon checkin and loved it! There was plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable. Our daughter loved the murphy bed. I really liked the bright and cheery feeling inside our suite. It had an abundance of windows. Although there is not air conditioning we were quite comfortable and enjoyed the cool breezes from the windows.The staff was very welcoming and eager to please. Housekeeping was great. We were sad to leave! ',GOOD,
'Reasonable Stayed here for a week in May. Reasonable location approx 4 blocks off Union Sq. Would probably like to be a little closer next time. Most of the staff were helpful. Room didnt have air conditioning which was a shame as it would certainly had benefitted.Breakfast and early evening drinks were included which was a good touch although the quallity of the food was only average.Would stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Very Nice..... I just needed a safe clean room at a good price. I found this here! My room was huge. Bathroom and shower huge. Nice kitchenette and mini bar. It is nit the Four Seasons, but I felt it was an excelent value. Good location, also. I checked in early and they were very accomodating. The only bad part was I had black hairs all over the bathroom. I guess the housekeeper was having a problem. Other than that, it was very nice. I would stay here again. ',GOOD,
'so-so value, plus tub trouble we stayed in a junior suite for $130/night, which was not exactly value for the price. The jacuzzi tub would not shut off around the midnight hour...we called the front desk, and the woman did not even understand the concept of the jacuzzi tub, kept asking if the tub was overflowing, and told us there was no maintenence until the next morning, completely useless and not even trying to assist us. Also, no air conditioning, only dusty fans, and with an 8th floor room on a hot weekend, it was pretty uncomfortable in the evening. breakfast was greasy donuts and croissants (no butter or jam) that one would expect at a motel, not a 3 star hotel...would only return to this place in a real pinch. ',POOR,
'Lovely hotel We stayed here for 7 nights in April, and were pleasantly surprised by the hotel. We asked for a quiet room - and had it apart from Friday night - but apparently this was noise from the hotel next door.Friendly staff, chambermaids always seemed to know when we had gone out. Walking distance to Union Square, free internet, breakfast, and drinks between 4-5pm.I wasn't feeling too well one evening, so called reception to find out if there was somewhere that I could get a baked potato - didn't want anything more substantial. After calling around, they couldn't find anywhere, so they asked me to buy a potato, and they cooked it for me. That's what I call adaptable service. Bit of a shame that we didn't qualify for a discount staying there for 7 nights, but it was a nice hotel in a nice location.If you go to Macy's, go to the visitor centre on the 6th floor with your passport - they'll give you a voucher for 11% off all purchases at all Macy's for 1 month. Well worth doing.We loved Lori's diner, and SF is somewhere that I would love to go again - would certainly stay at the Beresford Arms again. ',GOOD,
'good value in historical hotel nice older hotel near union square. good housekeeping. large room with full kitchen. we had xlnt 8th floor corner location with nice view but away from street. watch out for potential noise. however, beds were small and not comfortable, no fitted sheets, poor quality linens. note in room says ask for anything you've forgotten, but when i asked, they had no toothpaste. upon checkout at 615a, i found the front desk attendant soundly sleeping behind the desk, which raised security concerns. liked it overall, but need to sleep comfortably. also, nice asian theme coffee shop (Eura) across street. ',POOR,
'After free upgrade pretty good ! Hi,I麓ve booked the Beresford Arms for a Business trip to Frisco in early Jan 05 over the internet.When I arrived it was quite cold in SFO and when I came up to the room it was freezing. After turning on the small heater in the room, it didn麓t get much warmer. I have detected that the window in the kitchenette was broken and somebody tried to fix it with a towel. Even after keeping the door shut, the small heater was unable to get the room to a somewhat decent temperature. After complaining to the night clerk (an old lady, who was wearing big glasses, but still using a reading lense to read), she offered me another room, but this room was freezing and much louder. So I stayed the first night freezing and spoke to the Manager the next morning. She offered me a free upgrade to a Junior Suite and this was quite good !The room was spacious, warm, clean and very, very quiet ! Given the price of 90$ it was an excellent deal. The furniture was a bit old fashioned, but in good condition. The location of the Hotel is excellent, no hemoless people outside and very close to Union Square. Staff during the day was very helpfull, the old lady as the Night Clerk was a bit swamped with my complaint and unable to help.You have to be carefull what room you get, but staff is very helpfull and friendly ! ',POOR,
'a sense of history We visited San Francisco in Sept. of 2004. We are a family of 3. Husband, wife and 12 year old girl. Our favorite thing to do is get the feel of a city and the Beresford Arms allows you to do just that. I love th historic feel of the lobby and how nice it was to get together each morning for breakfast and evening for wine and cheese with fellow travelers. The rooms were very large, clean and the kitchenette was a nice plus. Great location, close to Union Square but in a neighborhood so you felt like a local. I would return again in a minute! ',GOOD,
'A great place to stay in San Fran We stayed in a junior suite last August and as this was our first family visit to the USA were not sure what to expect. However, were extremely pleased to have plenty of room for 4, a spotlessly clean bathroom, and all facilities in small kitchen. Lovely breakfast each day, very conveniently located in the city and staff very helpful. Our children want to visit again and I'm sure we will return to this beautiful city and use this lovely hotel again. Thoroughly recommended! ',GOOD,
'Excellent hotel My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in November and we loved the hotel. The location is really good, it's about 3 blocks from Union Square. The overall look of the hotel is very nice, you just don't see the style of architecture that this hotel has in newer buildings. Everything is very well maintanined and clean. The room was good, it was surprisingly large for a an older hotel, including the bathroom. The staff was very friendly. And the price was great especially considering the location. The only downside for us was the continental breakfast, the selection was very limited. But hey it was free and there are plenty of places to eat breakfast in the area, so we really didn't mind. We would highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Very bearable Beresford - even for a wheelchair. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Great location. Right to Union Square, left to Tenderloin - no big deal. Walked everywhere (car would be a pain in SanFran). Staff were helpful. Room was roomy. Slept like sleeping beauty, looked like sleeping ugly. Can mix it in lobby with other guests for free breakfast or afternoon wine and cheese hour. Free Internet PC in lobby was helpful for us too.For anyone else in a wheelchair, our benched wheel-in shower would accomodate an elephant in a Cadillac! Note the hotel itself has one-step at the main entrance (but does have a level side entrance).We'll be back for sure! ',GOOD,
'Very pleasant stay We stayed in this hotel in June, and weren't sure what to expect, but we were very pleased. We contemplated staying in a chain hotel, just so we would know what we were getting into, but felt we wanted to get in the spirit of the city, and stay in an older hotel. First of all, the staff was great, very friendly and helpful. We brought a car, so had to pay extra for parking, but they were very prompt in bringing the car around when we needed it. The hotel is also right on the bus line, so was very convenient when going to ANYWHERE around town. And since we had a CityPass, hopping on the bus was very easy and cash free. We opted for a parlour suite, which was great with 2 teenage daughters who do not want to share a bed. The bedroom had two queen beds, and the living room had a murphy bed, which was very comfortable. The bathroom was HUGE. We did not use the kitchen, but it was available, if we had chosen to. It was clean, and we loved the old hotel feel of the place. The lobby was beautiful, where we ate a continental breakfast every morning. My daughter especially liked the computers available in the lobby, so she could keep in touch with her friends at home. We happened to be at the hotel at 5pm one day when they had the wine and cheese out, and it was enjoyable talking to other guests and the hotel staff. The only inconvenience was the street noise in the morning. If I were staying there again, I would probably ask for a room higher up. But this was minor, and only really bothered us one morning and was part of the excitement of staying in the city. All in all, we felt very special, and it definitely enhanced our visit to San Francisco. ',GOOD,
'A Great Value! We stayed at the Beresford Arms from Sept 17-20, 2004. We had booked it on-line through their website and got a great deal, $129 per night for a Jr Suite!! The location is great, the staff was excellent, the rooms were roomy and clean. You can tell years ago in the Golden Age that is was a luxury hotel. It is still in great shape. We weren't facing the street and the room did not have AC but it was pleasant enough for us. We traveled with two kids and they really enjoyed it too. I would highly recommend this place. ',GOOD,
'Pleasant and Relaxed We had booked a room at the Beresford Hotel, but after reading reviews we moved our reservation to the Beresford Arms Hotel and were pleasantly surprised. We loved our suite and its antique style. The gold fixtures in the bathroom reminded me of our stay in antique hotels in London England. Staff members were friendly and accomodating to our needs. We definitely enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast and the wine social every afternoon. Not to mention, the bar in our room, which operates on the honor system. The rooms were very clean and nicely priced, our suite was priced at 89 dollars per night during our stay. We will definitely stay there again! ',GOOD,
'Pleasantly suprised on last minute booking We stayed here for 2 nights commencing 12/7 after doing a tour of hotels around the wharf which were all full. As it was 7.30pm I negotiated a good rate with reception for a junior suite. Hotel is old and as such is somewhat antiquated in style however, we found room clean and spacious with kitchenette and large bathroom (albeit window facing entry, room was on 2nd floor, lobby on 3rd as hotel on a hill, also window security not wonderful). We had tried to get into Nob Hill motel but it was fully booked as it had free parking so we had to live with paying $20/night at Beresford for valet parking. No bar, restaurant etc (free internet in lobby)but no issue as you are very close to a large selection. Close to union square for shopping and also getting cable car down to wharf. It does border on the shady tenderloin area, alot of homeless people around. However if you are sensible and dont wander round on your own at night you will be fine. Not the ritz but very good value in terms of space and location. ',GOOD,
'Would stay here again Stayed 3 nights in July 2004 with my two kids and my parents in a very nice suite. The room(s) were large enough that we all had space to breathe and relax. The central downtown location was within easy walking distance from Union Square and the Cable Car line. The staff were friendly and helpful and the wine reception was an enjoyable treat. They even offered juice for the kids. The lobby is beautiful and easy to see why this building is on the National Register of Historic Places. The only negative for us was that the fire trucks seem to use this corner to get across town as several passed by loudly each night during our stay.I would certainly recommend this hotel to my friends, and hope to visit again on my next trip to SF. ',GOOD,
'3 1/2 stars Not what I had in mind after reading the reviews. The room was a little funky - i.e. older decor like weird linoleum in the bathroom and foil wallpaper in the kitchen area. TheMy biggest concern was that the room could have been cleaner and the beds sucked! I found a little piece of trash under one of the dressers and a weird piece of tape on the bathroom counter. We had to flip the beds after the first night after having a bad night's sleep and waking up with a sore neck.Two great things about the hotel are location and size of room. The hotel is located in a great area within walking distance to Union Square, and a great little cafe one block over called the Titanic Cafe, I think. It was in another hotel on Sutter and Jones.The jr. suite room was huge by San Francisco standards - really the size of a small apartment, so that was great, and it also had a great bay window that opened on the sides -nice for fresh air. With a little better cleaning and new beds the room is a real score for the price. ',GOOD,
'Not what I expected after reading all the glowing reviews We stayed at the Beresford Arms after reading all the wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. After we arrived and were shown to our room, I was ready to check back out and find another hotel. Being that it was Memorial Day weekend, we figured it would be difficult to find another room at a reasonable price. I don't think the room had been updated since the 1960s. The huge mirrored wall at the head of the bed was a little weird. The bathroom had shiny silver and gold wallpaper and old gold fixtures. All the furniture was old and looked like stuff I would find at my grandma's house. With that being said, the room was extremely clean. And I was impress to see as we were leaving that housekeeping even takes the blanket off the bed to wash with the other linens. The location was good and parking was reasonable at $20 a night. But, I have stayed at nicer hotels in SF for about $10 more a night.  ',POOR,
'Like Going Home We have stayed at the Beresford Arms Hotel many times over the past 8 years. It has always been a friendly place, with a gracious staff. The afternoon wine tastings have offered an opportunity to meet and talk with people from different parts of the United States and the world. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and spacious for a city that size. The location is convenient for shopping and dining. It has become our home away from home when in San Francisco. We are looking forward to our next visit with Tag Knapp and her staff.  ',GOOD,
'Terrific value. Friendly staff. Location gives pause. I had a hassle free 3 night stay at this hotel. I booked through expedia.ca for a very reasonable bargain. It was my first visit and perhaps the last simply because the location within spitting distance to the sad and seedy Tenderloin neighbourhood gave me pause but the tradeoff was the proximity to Union Square and access to anywhere in city with the terrific MUNI and BART systems of San Francisco. I had some great misgivings about wandering during daylight hours let alone late at night. The hotel is in comparison an oasis. The lobby and hall decor are very clean and tasteful. The rooms although clean could use and update, particularly the plumbing. My room unfortuantely did not have a lot of natural light and the windows didn't open. You wouldn't want to anyway with the smells of the Tenderloin streets and the multitude of pigeons. My room looked out to an abandoned central cause/breezeway which should be cleaned up and the cooing pigeons evicted. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are so friendly in fact that the desk clerk are willing to have long winded but pleasant gardening conversation with an elderly woman guest whom I had to wait patiently behind to check out. Now, who in this world would be so generous with their time and kindness in this day and age? ',GOOD,
'Two thumbs up!! We stayed at the Beresford Arms during spring break, April 2004. The purpose of our trip was senior prom dress shopping for my daughter! The hotel was wonderful!!!!! I absolutely recommend the parlor suite. New bathroom, fixtures, extemely clean etc. The bedroom and main room were enormous for the price. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Two thumbs up! ',GOOD,
'One Night Stay Decent Hotel for the price. No a/c means you may need to leave the windows open and hope you have a room with a breeze - and you'll likely be getting street noise. Rooms are clean and a good size. Help was nice. On the border of the tenderlon district but close to Union Square (we walked - only three blocks). They did a very good job renovating the building and keeping it up. ',POOR,
'Good place for the price My wife and I stayed here for a few days in March 2004. While it is certianly not the ritziest hotel I have stayed in, it was good, especially for the price. We stayed in one of the moderately-priced suites for the extra $30 over a standard room, and I think it was worth it (we looked at the standard room for kicks). Much bigger, has a little kitchenette and a jacuzzi tub. Since we ate out, we could bring home doggy-bags for midnight snacking, out of the fridge and warmed up in the microwave....The location is fine for safety, but make sure you read up a little bit on the area. Most importantly, don't walk south on Jones all the way to Market - after several blocks, it takes you into the Tenderloin district which is not nice. That said, you have to walk a ways to find a seedy area....For touring, the location is fabulous. Every morning, my wife and I walked down to Union Square for a coffee, and you can go anywhere from there. Since we'd bought a MUNI pass, we could even hop a bus to the square if we were REALLY lazy, and you can go anywhere in the city from Union Square....We looked around at some of the other hotels in the area while walking around, and didn't think there was anywhere else we'd rather be staying....The daily winecheese was a nice touch, and we were more than satisfied with the complementarty breakfast fare.

'Nice Location A nice quiet location in the residential part of The Condado. Check in was simple even late at night and the front desk people were very nice and helpful. Only stayed one night before heading further into the Caribbean. Will use this property again when passing through and thats more than i can say for the countless other hotels tried in a dozen trips passing through San Juan. ',GOOD,
'Loved it I loved it. I was skeptical at first but when we got there it was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. Hotel was very clean, the balcony was beautiful. The food at the restaurant downstairs was delicious and so was the food at Wind Chimes Inn. Many of the local spots had good food too. The jacuzzi was very nice and warm. The beach is less than 50 feet away. I will come back. My friends who live there came to visit and they loved the place soo much that they are going to recommend it to their friends and family that comes to Puerto Rico to visit. The only thing that may be considered a Con (if there is one) is when Acacia closes you have to walk to the corner to Wind Chimes Inn to eat, and do anything else but it's not that bad it's literally right across the street. There is a nice restaurant 2 blocks on the left of Wind Chimes and Bebos is very close as well. If you don't mind walking there's a lot of things very close i.e. Uno, Walgreens, food on Ashford, Radisson, 24 hour grocery store, a park, and a local store that sells liquor..... You can get on either C53, B21, or A5 to go to Old San Juan..... It's located in a great spot. ',GOOD,
'Need to change This hotel belongs to the same management as the Atwindchimesinn,I called them to book the place ,and took the room atwindchimes inn and totally disappointed as the place is a mess,very lousy,and moist rooms and felt very suffocating in the rooms.Good room size but poor ventilation.I suggest dont go with the room images placed online as the pictures were EDITED.so i had to pay alot more for the room in Acacia seaside inn.This is right near to the atwindchimes.Here the rooms are very small, a queen bed in 130 sqft.:(.No near by restaurants,i felt they are very expensive compared to the room size and facilities.good things are that they few steps away from the condado beach,very nice beach,and in the nice locality,condado and easy access to the old sanjuan.and also good restaurants in 20 min walk.I Learnt that it is becoming very difficult to decide from the internet images to find if the hotel looks the same. ',POOR,
'Loved this small hotel My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at this small hotel. Initially a little concerned because our room was on the third floor and there are no elevators. However our room was wonderful and we really enjoyed sitting on our large balcony enjoying the views of the ocean and the cool breeze. We loved the large and relaxing jacuzzi. We enjoyed the fact that the temperature was not too warm as this hotel has no pool and the temperature was just right for a long soak. Missed having a refrigerator, which would have made it perfect. The sister hotel is nearby and does have a bar and a small but delicious menu to choose a small meal from. There is a nearby restaurant called bebos which you can walk to that offers a large menu choice. My husband is choosy and he did not want to leave . I fell in love with puerto rico and can't wait to return. ',GOOD,
'Outstanding service We had no idea where to stay while in San Juan and wanted to be centrally located. This place was perfect. The room (we had 303) had a delightful balcony overlooking the pool/spa with a view of the ocean. Loved the tiled bathroom and floors. Listening to the ocean all night was an added bonus...and after the rains we could hear the sounds of the coqui. We had exceptional help from Palmira making our stay there even more pleasant. She provided great hints and directions for where to go, what to do. Special thanks to her!! We loved our trip to Guavate and the fantastic meal of roast pig! A real Puerto Rican delight! The segway tour of Old San Juan was a real highlight of our trip! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Suite, Helpful Staff Acacia Seaside Inn is a small boutique hotel, which means that the staff know you by name and not only treat you in a respectful, courteous, professional manner, but regard you more as extended family.I arrived with my best friend and we booked the two-bedroom suite. The room was simple, but elegantly appointed. There was only one air-conditioner in my room, but my friend's room was more spacious than mine, so we pulled straws. The front desk attendant, Felix, really should be running this hotel, as he manages every thing about it with precision. Not only did he make sure that we got the room we requested (there was some initial confusion about availability), but he provided us with more information about the island and its activities than any manual or guide could have. He gave precise driving directions, exact names of persons who ran businesses three towns away (Pinones) and even told us about various points of interests to our liking. Parking can be difficult if you're renting a car, but it's not impossible. The hotel offers a guaranteed parking spot for a fee ($10 a day), but we were able to find space on the street. Many of the excursions that you'll want to do can be set up by the hotel, if you ask. They did not attempt to sell us on anything, merely suggested companies when we inquired. Through them, we were able to rent a car and double-check pricing for our Biolumiscent Bay tour (doing this resulted in a drop in our price, so we were pleased). GAY TRAVELLERS will be delighted with Acacia's location in the Condado area (akin to Chelsea in NYC, Castro Area in San Fran, and Chueca in Madrid. . .all C's. . .coincidence?). To top it off, the Acacia is walking distance from the gay beach off of Vendig Street, near the Atlantic Hotel. There is a nearby Internet Cafe and even a place to buy stylish swimsuits (Monsieur).The walk to various clubs is a bit longer, but enjoyable. There are SEVERAL places to eat in all price ranges. Many have mentioned Patisserie (3 stars), Pamela's (4 stars), Bebo's (3 stars). Toiletries can be bought at either of the two nearby Walgreens (one of which is 25 hours) on Ashford Street, and a nearby supermarket (Diego and Loiza) is open 24 hours. They even sell liquor. Overally, this hotel was wonderful. If I were to complain, I would ask the Acacia to increase the temperature on the 30-foot hot-tub (it was lukewarm), or would frown on the fact that there is no attendant at the front desk after 11:00pm (the attendant is stationed at the sister hotel, Wind Chimes Inn, about 100 feet up the block). Fastidious travellers will not like the fact that this small hotel doesn't really have room service or food options available, but my friend and I, both 25, are independent and don't need anyone to hold our hand. We would have enjoyed a fridge in the room, though, to keep our Puerto Rican rum and mixers cold. ',GOOD,
'Great place to stay in San Juan! Just returned from spending 5 days/4 nights at the Acacia. What a terrific place to stay! When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by Felix who informed us that our room had been upgraded. We checked into a king room on the 2nd floor right across from the large, beautiful stone hot tub! Nice room with air conditioning and a celing fan and a small balcony.The inn was less than a block from the beach! The next time we are in San Juan, we will definitely be staying here. ',GOOD,
'Waste of momey! Me and my friend stayed at the Acacia Seaside Inn for four nights. The staff at the front desk is overly friendly. Watch out! they are very pushy on tours they recommend. We went on akayak tour which began at 4pm. We did'nt eat anything figureingtheir would be a stop for dinner. Ha! They brought us to a smelly snack stand on the highway. That was our dinner.The other tour was to the rain forest. We stopped for a snackwhich we had to pay for including the tolls on the highway andthe entrance fee to the National Park. The next day I compainedto the person at the front desk and she gave me no satisfaction.The room was small with a 13 inch tube television. The doorto the balcony was all glass and had no courtain so at nightthe light came in right on the bed and anyone could see us inbed. We devised a makeshift courtain to cover the door. We weretold there was a continental breakfast at Wind Chimes Inna block away. This is there sister hotel. What they failed to tellus this breakfast was not complimentary. We did'nt find this outuntil checkout time when we were charged $25.58 for a bowlof cereal some toast and two cups of coffee. We complainedto the front desk to no avail. The only good things I have to sayabout our stay i the weather was perfect and the hotel was stepsfrom the beach. ',POOR,
'Excellent Value, wonderful experience! Arriving in San Juan is pretty easy, they have an easy tourist Taxi station and they knew exactly where my small hotel was located. I was booked in At Wind Chimes Inn. Upon check in, they told me I'd been updraded to their sister property the Acacia which is a half block away from the beach, after walking around both I do feel like I was upgraded. Entering Acacia is like going into a Spa with calming music, nice lighting, a friendly staff. I was able to check in right away and leave my stuff. I went for a walk and got to know the area, at first their didn't seem like much. Then i went back to the hotel and headed to the beach. I relaxed, swam, etc until it started to rain. Then went back to the hotel checked out the awesome hot tub they have, then took a nap in my room since I was exhausted. I went for another walk and found the touristy area on Condado where all the restaurants are. Since I'd had a hamburger for lunch at the hotel (at the Wind Chimes property that you have access too) I wasn't that hungry and at dinner at Wendy's and investigated the large hotel casinos which actually weren't all that great. I missed the gay bar that I'd been looking for, but doubled back and found it after watching a Puerto Rican folk dance in one of the parks and losing some money at blackjack. IThe next two days were sort of the same, beach in the morning until it rained. I found a Starbucks to get coffee at in the morning. I watched football one afternoon and went to Old San Juan another afternoon. It It's very pretty there, it is an easy bus ride to get there, I took a cab back which was also easy and inexpensive.I had a dinner at Fuddrucker's. While it is a big chain, I never find them anywhere else so that was nice. I also went to a Mexican place that was pretty good. All of these places were within easy walking distance of the hotel.I would return here in a heartbeat. Clean room, great staff, close to the beach and close to everything in the Condado area. ',GOOD,
'Rooms Are Downfall The property, apart from the rooms, is impressive. The decor is very ultra-cool and the restaurant (food and service) was outstanding. The only negative of the property is the rooms, or at least the one we stayed in, #301. Average at best. It did not seem to fit in with the rest of the decor. Maybe it had not been updated yet? What was advertised as a queen bed was really two twins pushed together. The room was very small with hardly any space to move around the room. The TV was a 13 portable (I did notice some rooms spa-side had what looked like 36 flatscreens). It reminded me of the room I used to stay in when visiting my grandmother's house. The huge hot tub on the 2nd floor was impressive, but the water was not hot at all and the waterfalls were not working. Service was friendly and prompt; however, unless they get the rooms up to par with the rest of the property I can't see how this can be considered the #1 hotel in Candado/San Juan area. ',POOR,
'Excellent Choice       Taken from balcony at room ',GOOD,
'Uneasy start, but a very smooth stay I booked this property for our honeymoon stay largely after reading the reviews here on Tripadvisor, and I don't regret doing that, as 90% of previous reviews were accurate enough for my tastes.The airlines forced us to arrive roughly 12 hours late, but a quick phone call to Felix took care of things for us. He even told me not to let our seemingly clueless cabbie take advantage of me, telling me that standard cab fare from the airport should be $15-$20.Upon arrival at 10:55pm, our hearts sunk just a little bit. The lobby was very dark, oddly decorated, with a few strange characters hanging around it. Some ominous music in the background gave the situation the feel of a bad 1970s scam job from some movie.After getting checked in and settled (room 205), as expected, the room was small with no closet. There was no plasma TV, only a small tube TV. The room was exceptionally clean, and our favorite feature was the very nice oversized shower. Room 205 was well away from the hot tub area, so noise was never a problem. We saw very few other patrons throughout the rest of our stay.As for the hot tub, it is easily the crown jewel of the inn. It's a little convoluted to get to from our section of rooms, but once we got there, it was worth the search. Most of the time there was only one other couple in the 30' tub. My wife and I even got to enjoy it by ourselves for a solid hour on a wonderful starry night. (NOTE: The jet controls are located right over the sign. We couldn't find them until another couple helped us.)The hotel location is well away from the tourist part of town, which is both good and bad. When you walk away from the strip, you get to experience the real San Juan, which is a little dirtier than the strip. Plenty of bashed up cars line the streets, as does a fair amount of garbage. Several of the other establishments were graffiti'ed up, and had razor wire protecting their fences, which is never a good sign. Despite all of these things, we were never in the presence of any threatening people at all.As for the beach itself, it is steps away from the main entrance, heavily lined with palm trees, as most photos will indicate. The beach was very peaceful with very few people on it. The surf was rough and the sand very peculiar. The grains were large, and with every step you sank 2-6 into the sand, even very close to the shore.The staff was polite and courteous, and even recommended a nice seafood restaurant for our final day on the island. My only complaint about the front desk is that they close from 11pm-6am, so if you need to check out in the middle of the night, you have to walk a block down the street to do so at the At Wind Chimes sister hotel. (I only make this complaint because we had to do this in the rain at 4:30am to make our 7:00am flight.)Despite the odd start, it was a good stay, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to deviate from the land of tourist traps and typical sterile chain resorts. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful My bf and I went to Acacia after we took the southern caribbean cruise and we LOVED it!! Upon walking in, i was pleasently surprised as to how much nicer it was than what i had expected. The people we nice and very helpful. I booked a room with one king bed and ended up with a room that had 2 and was right in front of thier pool size jacuzzi!!! It was very affordable and clean-- very spacious. We also had a big flat screen in our room which was nice. I loved this more than a big hotel because it is more intimate and you get the real feel of san juan. You really are steps from the beach and can see the ocean from the jacuzzi. I was happy. The only complaint that I have was that there was construction going on outside of out bathroom window on the street ---------and with a very thin window, you could hear the jackhammer but, it wasnt that bad because they started around 9 am. Those things have to be done sometome...You shouldnt even be in your room that much cause it is such a cool place! I would def stay there again. FYI-- Acacia is newer and nicer than At wind chimes (thier sister hotel). THe bar at At Wind Chimes is nice and the barteders were great. ALSO--- the food at Niche is excellent.... considered one of the best in condado/san juan area. Be prepared to spend at least $12-15 for cabs to old san juan area---- you will be spending a good amount of time in that area becuase that is where all the cool shops/bars etc are. I def suggest going to old san juan. I will add pics and comments soon. EES ',GOOD,
'OK My girlfriend and I stayed at the Acacia in mid May of 2008. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico although we have friends who highly advised that we go there. We are happy that we stayed at the Acacia because of the price and end result, but it wasn't perfect by any means. Issue #1- When we arrived on Saturday night, Felix checked us in to our room, 105. The next day, my credit card company called me with a fraud alert saying that they've given approval to bill my account to this same place twice (I brought this to the attention of the front desk and we had that fixed). After our vacation I noticed on my credit card statement that I was indeed charged twice for my room, even after we addressed this with the front desk. I'm sure a mistake, but it seems that it could have been avoided.Issue #2- The first room we were given was 105, on the first floor, behind the front desk. Do not stay in this room. It is spacious enough, but only has 1 window that is in the bathroom and looks up to the parking lot behind the building. There is no natural light in this room. Also, it is close to the restaurant kitchen so you hear the wait staff until the kitchen closes. (Though, the food in the restaurant was delicious.) The biggest problem with room 105 was that, during the night the a/c was dripping inside the room (because it wasn't a window unit). In the morning we realized what happened and looked at the wall where the water was dripping and saw a LOT of mold. It was apparent that it wasn't the first time that happened and was most likely known before we were given the room (there was a bucket behind the couch by the wall meant to catch the water from the a/c). Anyway, the next day, the staff gave us a new room with a balcony and nice view, so that made up for it. Issue #3- There is no parking on the street for the Acacia. When making a reservation, try to get a spot in the Wind Chimes parking lot. If you can't, you'll be parking a couple blocks away. (My rental was perfectly safe, but I did see a couple cars along the same street with windows broken so that was in the back of my mind)Positives: The beach is a few steps out the door and has great surf. Breakfast at the Wind Chimes was good and free I think (don't have the milk though) On our first night, Freddie (restaurant manager) drove us to Bebo's because their kitchen had already closed. Thanks! ',POOR,
'adorable, wonderful hotel!! highly recommended!!! my husband and i loved our stay at the acacia. it was the perfect, relaxing, quiet get away. the hotel was adorable--very clean, wonderfully decorated and designed, and RIGHT on the beach!! the hot tub was amazing and overlooks the ocean--incredible. the staff was amazing, palmira is the sweetest and SO incredibly helpful. the hotel is close to everything that san juan and the neighboring areas have to offer, yet its located in a quiet residential area for a relaxing get away. we loved our stay here and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see the best that san juan has to offer without having to sacrifice a comforting and serene atmosphere. if you are considering staying here--think about it no more and just book it!! ',GOOD,
'Great value by the beach... We did a lot of research before traveling to San Juan, and the Acacia turned out to be a great value. The rooms are nicely appointed, the proximity to the beach is great, the staff is friendly and attentive, the common areas are cool, and the hot tub is just gorgeous. We really liked staying so close to Ocean Park, as we got to hang out on the local beach, away from the noise and tourist traps on the strip. Only downside are the food options...the breakfast buffet at the Wind Chimes is not worth $11.95, when you can walk down the street to Pinky's or Kasalta for a great, inexpensive meal. We also tried the on-site restaurant, Niche, and while the space was beautifully designed, we were unimpressed with the bar, the service was distracted (surprising given that there were only two parties in the restaurant the night we were there), and the food was inconsistent (one excellent entree, one just middling). Walk down the beach to Pamela's if you're looking for a splurge meal. ',GOOD,
'Could be great, but... I just came back from 3 nights at the Acacia Seaside Inn. Over the last two years, I've stayed at pretty much every single guesthouse in Ocean Park and Condado, but this was my first time staying at the Acacia (Numero Uno was booked, and so was At Wind Chimes Inn - they in turn referred me to the Acacia). Overall, the rooms and common areas at the Acacia are by far the nicest. The owners clearly take great pride in their property, and this is evident in the general upkeep and cleanliness of the Inn, and the friendliness of the staff. The rooms are comfortable, with nice touches such as plasma TVs, the bathrooms are large and well-appointed, and the proximity to the beach is second only to Numero Uno. In terms of price/quality, I'd be hard-pressed to come up with better value. What could have been a great stay, however, was ruined by the incessant noise that came every single night from the spa/pool area. Part of the problem is that the spa, while officially closed after 11:00pm, is accessible at all hours of the day and night. One night, I was awoken at 4:30am by a group of drunken guests who kept partying in the hot tub until 6:00am. Part of the problem is also because the Inn is not staffed after 11:00pm, so there is no one on site to keep things calm. Calls to the front desk of At Wind Chimes Inn, the sister property down the street, resulted in sympahetic apologies, but nothing more was done about it. The biggest problem, however, seems to be that the Acacia hasn't quite figured out what it wants to be. By tolerating loud drunken behavior (and since I'm not the first reviewer to write about it, it points to the fact that it's an ongoing issue), management is implicitly condoning it. If they want to be a party-type hotel and rent rooms to large groups, so be it. That said, they can't be all things to all people, and they need to realize that this choice comes at the expense of guests who like me, are just looking to relax in peace and quiet. It' a shame, really, and I hope they do something about it. ',POOR,
'Coolness and Charm I know, I know: coolness and charm seem incompatible, yet the Acacia pulls it off. I hesitate raving about the Acacia for fear Staters will inundate the place, expecting Wifi, slick tv's throughout and a concierge who kisses your Chihuahua in three different languages. But I owe a debt to Trip Advisor for the reviews I had read about both this hotel and its sister hotel and want to thank the entire staff of these inns for their warmth.I too had booked a room in At Wind Chimes, Acacia's sister hotel a half-block away. Instead, I was given a room at the Acacia. Wind Chimes would have been fine and, in fact, I spent a good amount of time in their tropical bar and the pool (small but wonderful atmosphere). I didn't see any of Wind Chimes's rooms but the rest of the hotel was wonderful. Like Acacia, there were plenty of little places to escape with a book or with someone else. Everyone on the staff was extremely welcoming. Allen and Mario at the Wind Chimes outdoor bar were beyond wonderful, attentive without being obsequious and just plain a lot of fun to hang around.And so was the staff at Acacia: Felix and the great women behind the desk as well as the terrific waitress at Niche, the hotel restaurant, were as accommodating as could be. The restaurant, as we say in Boston, was wicked awesome. It's so hard to describe the ambience but think the coolest boutique hotel restaurant, with granite walls and mood lighting from floor (actually under the floor) to ceiling. The ceviche was tremendous beyond words. But the place is beautifully small so do reserve a table; it probably seats less than 25 people, including the bar.Actually, one of the best meals I had in the Condado was at a local, family restaurant about 3 1/2 blocks away from the ocean, a left off of Taft Street and a few doors on the other side of the Esso. It doesn't sound glamourous and it's not, but its bright local color and fresh fish are not to be missed. Sorry, the name escapes me. Calling the Acacia's hot tub a tub is like calling the Atlantic Ocean a pond. It's as big as the pool at Wind Chimes, more like a giant, meandering spa. Check out the photos someone else has included in their review on this site. At night the tub glistens and you float into heaven, buoyed by the salt water and tranquilizing minerals. My room was fanatastic. I didn't go to Puerto Rico to watch tv, play with my Blackerry or demand that people treat me like an entitled American. And I don't mind not hanging my clothes up for a week. If you miss a closet, you're packing too many clothes. It's very hot in PR. The sea breeze betrays a scorching sun. I lay in the shade under a palm tree at the end of Taft street for about 45 minutes and got a hell of a burn. Keep the summer sweaters in your closet at home; you'd feel overdressed in the Condado.When I was there the surf was especially high and pretty violent. I'm a strong swimmer and I had a tough time with the undertow. The locals respect the beach in this part of the island and there's a reason very few people go in the ocean here, and never stray out too far. It's just too dangerous, definitely not a place for children. But the sound of that surf, frenzied by the night winds, with palm tress licking at the moon, is incredibly seductive--nature's tango.I could go on and on. This is just my kind of place, but I concede it is not for everyone. The Acacia is still undergoing renovations and you cannot make or receive long distance calls in your room, my room anyway. If you're accustomed to the conveniences of the States and like the predictability of Starbucks, TGI Fridays and Marriot, if you are intolerant of anyone that doesn't speak American, you'll find a reason to be inconvenienced. You know who you are and don't stay here. As a matter of fact, just stay in Disney where no doubt the closets are ample. Save nirvana for the rest of us. ',GOOD,
'Great Place to Stay for the Most Part We recently returned from a 4 night stay at the Acacia Seaside Inn in Condado, San Juan. Its a great bargain at a terrific location. We had only one problem with the place. We were looking for a relaxing, quiet getaway and the hotel had a spring break vibe to it. The main reason may have been that our room was located right in front of the very large hot tub on the second floor. From late in the afternoon until the middle of the night on one night, the hot tub was filled with twentysomethings drinking. We tried to call the front desk in the middle of the night; but they close at 11 pm. We discussed it with the management the next morning, after we found our front patio area littered with empty beer cans and bottles. They told us they would send security from their sister hotel (At Wind Chimes) to patrol the area. The rest of the nights were quiet after midnight, but our room was surrounded by people drinking every afternoon. The rest of our visit was wonderful. The people at the front desk were very helpful. We enjoyed many area restaurants including Kasalta for breakfast, Piu Bello for lunch and Miro and Ikakos for dinner (all found on Avenida Ashford/McCleary). We ate one night at the hotel's new restaurant, Niche. It was an excellent meal and very elegant room with a great vibe. If we return to San Juan, we would love to stay at the Acacia again, we would just ask for a room away from the hot tub. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel, Great Location My partner and I stayed here for three days prior to a cruise in February 2008. I had reserved here after reading some great reviews on Trip Advisor. Since our stay began smack dab in the middle of President's Day week I booked about 10 months in advance.We both loved the hotel and the location as well as the very friendly and helpful staff. We found the hotel very clean and well kept and our accomodations the same. Our room, although a little small, was perfect for what we needed. Be aware that there no closets to hang clothes. There was a rack attached to the wall where you could hang individual items but something like a garment bag would have probably torn it off the wall. Additionally there is no elevator so if that's an issue I would request a ground floor room. Our room number was 301 and was a corner queen room with a wrap around balcony. Our view was the beach approximately 150 to 200 feet away.If you are traveling to this area for the first time and are unsure of what to do just ask Felix who works at the sister hotel down the street At Wind Chimes for suggestions. Every restaurant that he suggested to us was spot on. Thank-you Felix!We loved the location of Acacia Seaside Inn as it is located on the border between Condado and Ocean Park. For the most part we loved exploring the Ocean Park neighborhood because it gave us an idea of what it's like to actually live in San Juan rather than just vacation there. There were many charming local restaurants and shops in the area. I would caution folks that do not come from urban areas or find poverty distateful that some of the streets in the area might not be their cup of tea. Also if you do not like to walk much you might be better served in a different part of San Juan. For the most part we found the neighborhood to be quite lovely with some very interesting architecture.We would most definitely stay at Acacia Seaside Inn again. It's one of those places that you just know that you'll return to some day. ',GOOD,
'botique critique 2+3=5       great beach;) ',POOR,
'Great Experience The location is perfect/ right by the beach near shops and bars. In a non-commerical but safe area. The staff was extremely helpful will plan your whole trip for you if you need them to. The restuarant in the hotel was simply outstanding. Great presentation, service was great and the staff was very helpful with the menu. The bar and barfood at Windchimes was good as well. The rooms are small but suitable for two people and they were always clean and ready for use. The views from the balconys were very nice. The rooftop deck was secluded and relaxing. The hottub was beautiful. I would recommend anyone who is making their first trip to San Juan to stay at the Acacia Seaside Inn ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Time, Very Charming!       The Hot Tub and there was no Chlorine only Salt water and minerals! Heavenly! ',GOOD,
'Best staff, beautiful hotel       Comfy bed ',GOOD,
'Great Stay We had a great post cruise stay here. As others have said, the rooms are on the small side, but big enough for the two of us and out luggage. The balconies are great. Large and a partial view of the ocean. Staff was very helpful in every way. There was a difference in our quoted price and what they requested, but this was corrected the next day. No problem.It is about 1/2 mile walk to several restaurants. It was a nice sidewalk walk with many other people so we felt safe. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. ',GOOD,
'We loved the Acacia Seaside Inn My wife and I stayed at the Acacia for three days and we loved it. We had what I believe was described as a Queen room with balcony. It was a third-floor room overlooking the jacuzzi. The room was small, but fine for just my wife and I. The room and the facility were tastefully decorated and very pretty. The bathroom was actually quite large by comparison. The balcony was a comfortable fit for two people, and had two simple plastic chairs. It was very clean and well kept and we had no problems of any kind. The staff was very friendly and helpful.Being in a largely residential district, we found it very quiet and had no problems with noise. It was just a short walk to the restaurant strip, and there were a few places just a couple of blocks away.Others have commented on the parking, which is five spaces at their other property, the At Wind Chimes Inn. I wouldn't try it in anything larger than a compact car, but it was manageable. If you are just staying in the area and going to Old San Juan, I would suggest forgetting the car altogether. A taxi to Old San Juan was $14USD from the hotel area.We didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant on the premises, so I can't comment on that.If you want a full-service hotel with lots of on-site amenities and a more traditional hotel feel, this isn't the place. If you want a more unique, boutique facility that is conveniently located, then I would definitely recommend the Acacia. ',GOOD,
'Home away from home. upon arrival we were treated with such care. We were given a map of all the things to see and the places to eat, if your wanted authentic puerto rician food and experience. Our room was looking out at the ocean. the belcony was wonderful at night to sit and enjoy a cocktail. It was very clean and professional. The area was very safe and minutes away from the happening strip. I would stay here again and would recommend to everyone else. This was a great home away from home. And we suggest you walk the area and sit and talk to the locals. ',GOOD,
'nice staff i stayed in this hotel...boutique// with my family rooms are very clean,,staff was great and very helpful specially santos !! the night clerk he provided us me and my family with all information and palces to go ..also gave us real attention and hospitality..this hotel was very beatifull and pleasant..i really reccomend staff and the hotel to others ',GOOD,
'great place My wife and I stayed at Acacia for three nights and enjoyed our time there. The room was well-maintained and the housekeepers did a fine job. The jacuzzi is the nicest amenity of the hotel and we definitely took advantage of it quite a bit. We liked that it was maintained at a very comfortable temperature -- it kept us warm at night but unlike a hot tub, we could spend more than 10 minutes in it without breaking into a sweat. We didn't eat at the new restaurant, Niche, but we did have a few mid-afternoon drinks at the bar at the nearby sister hote, the Wind Chimes. The beach is 30 seconds down the street. There is a decent deal of surf, and the sand, while good, is not great, as it is a bit coarse. Also, for at least half a mile in either direction on the beach, there's nothing but more beach -- I mean, there are no bars or restaurants or anything (I guess whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal preference). While the hotel does have beach towels, they are pretty small -- I'd call them more above-average-sized-bath-towels, as beach towel, at least to me, means a big towel that you can lie flat on without your legs hanging off.The location of the hotel was ideal. If you go up Taft and turn right onto Calle Mcleary, which soon turns into Avenida Ashford, you'll quickly run into many English-friendly restaurants. We twice ate breakfast at LaPatisserie, a 5 minute walk from the restaurant on the corner of Mcleary and Diego, and recommend it highly. Further up on Ashford there is a pharmacy (right next to the hospital), a liquor store, and a bus stop for the B21 line, which runs into Old San Juan. However, if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, and fairly confident in your Spanish, you can go two blocks up to Calle Loaiza and head left (east). This area has many restaurants with much more of a local flavor (and some standard fastfood spots). Servers that speak English in this area are not a given. On Calle Loaiza you can also pick up the A5 bus to take you into Old San Juan. Anyway, the Acacia is a nice play to stay. The decor is attractive and the staff helpful. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. ',GOOD,
'A Little Gem! A group of us - 3 couples - stayed here for 3 days after a Caribbean cruise. We had a wonderful time.It is a small privately-owned hotel on the edge of Condado with only 15 rooms and practically right on Ocean Beach - it is literally 70 yards from the hotel, about a mile long, and a superb beach for relaxing, people watching and swimming - but there is some surf so not suitable for young children. The hotel provide free towels for the beach at reception. The hotel was immaculately clean and the front desk staff were absolutely excellent and so helpful. The rooms are not large but perfectly adequate. They have a hanging rail rather than a wardrobe but bags of drawer space. Many rooms have french doors opening onto lovely balconies. We really loved the huge outdoor jacuzzi - it is about 30 ft long and built out of tiles and natural stone - lovely to relax in after a day of sightseeing or on the beach. They have a newly opened restaurant called Niche which we thought was superb. It is fine dining, so not cheap, but we thought it good value for high quality food well cooked. There is plenty choice with some quite different and innovative East meets West dishes on the menu as well as more conventional offerings. The small bar and restaurnat are quite quirky - we loved it. Taxis are readily availbale by walking up the street or reception will call one for you - about 10 minutes and USD12 to Old San Juan.In summary this is a little gem of a place and excellent value for money for San Juan, where hotel prices are pretty sky-high. ',GOOD,
'wonderful place The hotel was really, really nice and very clean, although the room was on the small size with no closet to hang our clothes. Everyone at the desk was extremely friendly and helpful. Their on-site restaurant is billed as one of the finest in San Juan, but we rarely saw anyone there and wanted to eat outside, so didn't stop in.We were never told about the terrace on the top floor where you could sun yourselves and shower until we were leaving - too bad because it offered a great view. They provide small beach towels that are not large enough to stretch out on...and there were only 2 chairs for rent ($5) from Wind Chimes across the street. Again - we weren't told until the last day that we could have rented beach chairs from a hotel nearby. Other than that...the place was perfect...great TV reception....great maid service...good location - a minute's walk from the ocean....and we were close to the main strip. (btw...there is no in-room coffee service so you need to walk a bit to find a place for breakfast - there are a couple of Starbucks nearby).It's VERY easy to rent a car (from Target Rental) and were glad we didn't take the advice of the desk clerk who said we could pay $57 apiece to get on a tour to the Rain Forest. He described the ride there as 'treacherous' . We paid only $25/day for a car and found the ride there fine and not dangerous as he described! ',GOOD,
'Loved the Hot tub We stayed at the Acacia Seaside mid-January. We loved it. Loved the quite location. The beach was just steps away. We had a queen room with a balcony. It was nice to just open the doors and enjoy the fresh air. (Can't do that in Michigan in January.) Everyone at the front desk was helpful. Thanks Felix. The hot tub was a nice ending to each evening. Especially the day we did the canyoning adventure. We did not try the new restaurant, but it smelled great. Kudos to the bartenders at the boat bar. They know how to make drinks. We didn't rent a car, so no problem for parking for us. We walked a lot, took the bus or a tour. We thought about renting a car, but after one day in traffic we decided to let the tour guides to the driving. The only down side (for my husband, not me) having to wait for the Boat bar to open in the morning to get coffee. I don't drink coffee, so I don't care. You do have to walk to get food, unless you go to the Boat bar or the on site restaurant, but we love to walk so it wasn't a problem for us. If you go to Old San Juan, I highly recommend the Harbor Brew House. Great steak. We would stay here definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Good overall, with some problems Many have given this boutique hotel 5 stars and it has much going for it. A few problems dropped it down for us, but if there were a 3.5 rating, that is probably closer to what we found. Very cute place overall, but the owners seem to have stopped work on it before it was really done. If it is all in the details, (especially at over $200 a night) then they have a way to go.  First the good, which many have mentioned. Good location, clean well appointed place. The staff was very freindly overall, but did not respond to problems with anything other than a blank stare. What were the problems?1. No place on premise to get coffee or sodas at anytime of the day or night. Yes, it is only a block to their sister place, but a pot of coffee for the guests would have made mornings much nicer. This would not cost them much, but the feeling was that anything that held down profit from their sister hotels bar and food shack was not going to happen. A walk to the nearest store for a cup of coffe or pastry was close to a mile.2. The giant plasma screen TV's on the wall in the rooms are not in HD, so you have a giant, lousy picture. Also, there are no guides to the channels in the rooms, and our TV had over 200 choices, (many of them blank) so finding anything to watch was a major chore. When I suggested to the desk that someone might want to type up a guide for the rooms, I was told that they had only been open about six months, and they did not have the time. Sorry, but this could be done by the overnight person at the desk in a few moments if they cared. 3. Balconies with no usable furniture. We paid extra for a room with a balcony, only to find that wihout a small table and chairs, it really was pointless. You can't sit on the ground. Again, a suggestion that they might want to consider putting these on the patios was met with a stare. 4. Suspected kickbacks to the staff from service places. Everytime we suggested we were going to eat somewhere the front dest jumped all over it to get us a Must have reservation only for us to find we were one of only a handfull of tables in the place. Also had them book us a car, and when we went to pick it up, the rate was $10 higher per day for us than the customers in line in front of us who just wandered in. No explaination was given.5. Parking for the hotel. A car is really a must if you want to see any of the island, but parking is terrible. When we rented the car, the front desk person said we would always be able to find a spot within a block or so. NOT. Sometimes we would have been better off walking the mile to the main drag rather than fight the parking situation.  So, this place could be a solid 5 stars with management that wanted to make the details a high priority. We did not dislike the place, but kept shaking our heads at how simple it would be to make it really special. Hope they do so. ',POOR,
'Would Stay Again in a Heartbeat We did a lot of research before booking. We thought we were staying at the Wind Chimes Inn (sister hotel a block away), but got moved to the Acacia when we checked in. We were glad we did, since it's been recently updated and was beautiful. The Acacia is only a block from the beach and is an easy walk to Ocean Park and the Condado strip. We walked to all these places easily. Guests can use the pool at Wind Chimes or hot tub at Acacia. Both were very pleasant. The Boat Bar is really nice; we had some great drinks and food, and the staff was personable. The front desk managers were extremely helpful and friendly. They gave us tips on restaurants, rental car agencies, etc., and even made reservations for us. We booked their best room. It was large, had a great leather futon in the sitting area, and came with a very large flat-screen TV. ',GOOD,
'A Little Gem! After researching hotels in the San Juan area on-line, we took a chance on Acacia since it was newly renovated, the price was reasonable and it was near the beach. We were more than pleasantly surprised with the welcoming and extremely helpful staff, comfortable room, and giant jacuzzi! With our two children ages 4 and 7, we spent three nights as a part of a 6 day vacation and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The jacuzzi was the perfect temperature and our kids could swim around while we relaxed. We could walk to the beach (less than two minutes from the room) and a short walk to a park for the kids to play and 10 minute walk to restaurants. We ate a few meals at the bar/restaurant down the block at Wind Chimes (you are given access since they are sister hotels) and we loved the kitchy semi-outdoor atmosphere and the food and drinks were great. Beware that what is on the menu is not always available and the wait can be a few extra minutes but it's worth it. If you order your Mojito Puerto Rican style, you only need to order one! Condado Beach is not the prettiest beach or the nicest beach for young children as the waves are large and there were many groups of young people on spring break, but we were able to find some quiet areas to catch some sun and make sand castles. Definitely take a trip for an afternoon at Luquillo Beach, the water is warm and clear, waves small, great for swimming, and there is a market of local cuisine, most of the people do not speak english but it is a great chance to experience the real culture. When we get back to Puerto Rico someday we will definitely stay at the Acacia again! The hotel is very quaint, quiet and would be great for a couples getaway and families who want something other than the typical chain hotel. ',GOOD,
'Highly recommend it.       front of hotel ',GOOD,
'great place! This was a great location. Right on the beach. The rooms are a bit small but comfortable. Service at front desk is exceptional. The restaurant is very small and pricy but set aside a night for a meal. Exceptional. Acacia is located on the edge of a middle class to lower middle class neighborhood once you leave the high rises that comprise the first few blocks to the beach. Some shops that are interesting, a few local places to eat, easy bus route to Old San Juan (A-5) half hour ride, even a Temple nearby. We oaid $125 in early December for a room with a pool and partial ocean view. Hint. You can rent a car at Target Car Rental about half a mile away. They'll pick you up. Front desk will handle it. We rented a car for the weekend to travel to Ponce, the rain forest and the observatory. Murder traffic during the week. This hotel is located in an area of little parking but on street is available a few blocks up Taft St on which the hotel is located. When you cross Loiza just park your car on that section of Taft and save $10 a night. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Villa My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon. We were in a double bed room with no balcony, but it did have a window.All the staff were very nice and the room  facilities were all very clean.My favorite part of the villa was the huge hot tub they had on the second floor.The room was small (not unusual for the San Juan area) and there was no desk (bad for business traveler). However I was not on business I was having a vacation and found the room great. There also isn't an elevator, but I don't know why you would be traveling with luggage you can't carry.The beach is one building away from the hotel and one block away from the wind chimes.I was only once bugged about a tour( which I expected).We were on the third floor and showered in the morning at the same time as everyone else and had no heat problems. The shower head was even adjustable so you could change the pressure to whatever you wanted.We walked to the Marriott casino for an evening of fun, it was about a 10 minute walk. Also we ate at the best restaurant next to the Radisson called Zabo the food was just top notch!I speak very little Spanish and found the two cafes near the hotel a hassle to eat at for this reason, therefore I really liked the boat bar.If you have any questions feel free to contact me. I would stay there again! ',GOOD,
'Jelson's makes some great Sangria's! Stayed there with my wife the last weekend in November. We absolutely loved the place. It was a great, small inn with excellent touches. Very clean and great staff. We had a great time at the Boat Bar. Eddie, Jelson and Jay were incredible cooks and served outstanding drinks. Jelson makes a killer Sangria! They concierge set us up with a rental car one day for 27 bucks! We were able to visit the rain forest as well as some other more private beaches for a fraction of the cost of one of the tours.The location is a bit out of the way, so be sure to bring some walking shoes. We really didn't mind, and found this great little breakfast place called Pinky's around the corner.All in all, I would suggest this place to anyone. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Acacia and loved the area of town After spending most of the day lost (after all, we were in Puerto Rico) my husband and I arrived at the Acacia Guest House and found Fillipe at the front desk. Just a note here about finding your way around the island - you can't. Don't rely on maps, don't rely on directions from locals, don't count on street names. You can, however, rely on Fillipe. He can not only give you accurate street directions, he can get you to the best meal you've ever had or help you find computer communication centers at all hours of the day and night. Fillipe was an instant friend. We would not venture back on the island without consulting him first. The Acacia was much closer to the beach than we expected, from our balcony, room six, I had a view of the ocean - it is a short half block walk to the beach - beautiful.Parking is a slight problem, you are in a neighborhood, a lovely neightborhood. This is nothing like the hotel strip in Isla Verde. You find yourself close to many restaurants and Starbucks is just around the corner. Window shopping was relaxing and a must, it made for a long enjoyable stroll. This area seems safe and I was very comfortable walking here - as were other tourists/locals after dark. Our room was very comfortable and pretty, I loved the bathroom tile - shower only. This place feels like an historic building and it might be although it also feels fresh and new at the same time. The new outdoor hot tub is gorgeous. This is just plain and simply 'a nice place to be'.If ever again I am traveling on the main island of Puerto Rico - this will be my first stop. ',GOOD,
'Little sister is a knockout! We booked a room for the Wind Chimes down the street but they were full so they moved us over the Acacia. We were pleasantly surprised! Convenient Condado location in quiet neighborhood, only steps from the beach. Very helpful staff. Felix is top notch. Great hot tub _can just see the waves crashing on the beach from it. Our room was newly updated with bear skin rug on the wall and a plasma tv. Spent 5 days here and would come back to again. Nice amenities for the price. ',GOOD,
'Not for business traveler This place is fine if all you want to do is go to the beach (which is only a few steps away) and go to bed. First of all, there is a 3 night minimum, I only stayed 2 nights but had to pay for 3. There is only one restaurant in their sister hotel down the street Wind Chime Inn, and the food is mediocre at best. If you want something to drink after 11:00 pm, you will have to walk about 4 blocks down the street to the gas station because there is no soda machine or water fountain in either hotels, and the restaurant at the Wind Chimes closes at 11:00 pm. The staff is incompetent, all they are good at is calling a taxi for you. They can't even split a bill, which as a business traveler is essential. I've stayed at many hotels around the world and this is the first one that could not remove something from one bill and put it on a separate bill. It's a very nice hotel, but not for a business traveler, or anyone that likes convenience. ',POOR,
'Great Deal, Location  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with great service. The manager provided a map of the area  showed us local places to eat  go out at night. Their jacuzzi is the largest I've ever seen and the picturesque beach is a stones throw away. Their new gourmet restaurant Niche was unforgettably great  the tiki bar at the Wind Chime provided decent bar food  cheap drinks. Everyone we spoke with loved their stay  we would return in a minute. ',GOOD,
'Good location, some issues. Our stay started out on the wrong foot. When I called the number on the Acacia website, and got about 3/4 through my reservation they told me I called Wind Chimes! So, I had to call the REAL Acacia number and started my reservation again--only to be told that they wouldn't take my 2 night reservation as they felt stays less than 3 nights was disruptive. Feeling slightly put off but not completely dismayed, I called Wind Chimes and told the lady what happend (she noted that the man at Acacia was probably just being lazy) and completed my reservation.Fast forward to check in day--the hotel has a wooden door on the street, then you go up some steps to get to the REAL door. After lugging our bags up and in...and waiting about 15 mins for the receptionist to get off the phone. We are told that we were upgraded to the Acacia--even though she framed it as an upgrade I was a little upset at having to haul my luggage down the stairs and down the street to a new hotel--that I wanted to stay at in the first place! We sucked it up and headed to Acacia. When we get there, the night desk man (who I suspect is the same man who wouldn't take my reservation in the first place), tells us just how lucky we were to get upgraded and how fortunate we were. He was very condescending treating us like poor bumpkins who lucked out at getting an upgrade when we wanted to stay their in the first place. He also proceeded to chide us on our choice visit Rincon-he did his very best to talk us out of going..which was pretty annoying since we weren't asking for opinions about it.We got a balcony room on the second floor--caution they don't have an elevator, which is understandable, but they don't have a bellman, so good luck getting your luggage upstairs! Our balcony faced a parking lot and the roof, no view whatsoever! So there was no point in the balcony at all.Lastly, the front doors are glass, covered by a curtain that through certain angles people can see you through.We had to rig something up so people couldn't see us lying in bed!On the good side, the hotel is clean and nice looking, excellent location, and the hot tub is fantastic!!!! The crew at the bar at Wind Chimes are excellent!. Would I stay again? Probably not. ',POOR,
'Great Boutique Hotel, Sometimes Friendly Staff       Hot tub!! ',GOOD,
'Not what its cracked up to be! We were originaly scheduled to stay at At Winds Chime Hotel, however, upon checking in, the A/C was not working, so we were moved to the Acacia. The staff is nice and the hotel clean, but a few things bothered us. The night clerk can be a bit pushy trying to sell you a tour. There always happened to be exactly 2 cancellations for a tour that was on the next day, and he needed an answer really quick......without giving much info about the tour. One tour we did book with him (the Luminessence Bay Tour) we had $100 stolen out of a supposedly secure van. Upon returning, we mentioned it to the clerk, he denied anyone would do it and refused to investigate the incident - so beware the tour companies the hotel uses! There were water pressure problems almost on a daily basis (no pressure or hot water). The restaurant, which was to be opened in July, was yet to be open, we had to go elsewhere to even get a cup of coffee. The Hotel location is in Condado.......the far edge of Condado, a 5-6 block walk to anything, including restaurants, and almost a mile to the central part of the Condado area. As far as the rooms go, if you are anywhere near the hot tub, bring earplugs, and it wasnt because of the guests - it appeared to be the staff hanging out in it and they were loud! The day before we were to leave, I asked if there was a computer with a printer so I could check in for my flight - I was directed to a internet cafe - 8 blocks away! If you are looking for a full service hotel - this is not the place by far. Next time, We're staying at the Marriott - its worth the extra cost! ',POOR,
'Nice place. Very close to the beach. We orig. booked at the At Wind Chimes (there sister hotel) but after arriving, were told we were upgraded to the Acacia down the street. We were told we had full access to all the services in both hotels. The At Wind Chimes has a small, but cute pool and a bar that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and is open until 11pm. My girlfriend and I had breakfast there (which was great and inexpensive) and we had dinner (which we didn't love.) and drinks (the Sangria is good, good mixed drinks and a few usual and local beers.) We tried going back for breakfast, but there are less than 20 stools at the bar and it gets packed. The menu isn't huge. The staff was Great. Very nice people.  At the Acacia, we were greeted by Felix. He was very helpful and nice. He broke it down for us. He gave us a couple of maps and circled good restaurants, beaches and other helpful info. The Acacia is beautiful...and it's only steps from the beach. the lobby is very nice. They have a big stone jacuzzi and they're working on a bar as well. The room is nice, but small. We had a balcony with a view of the jacuzzi and the beach. No phones...but I wasn't expecting any calls so it was cool.  The Acacia is really close to one of the nicest beaches. It also has an outdoor shower to rinse off after you visit the beach. They also provide you with beach towels (free) and even beach chairs and umbrellas. It's close to a few restaurants and shops. (ask Felix for his recomendations) and close to bus stops which take you to all of the local tourist areas. It's only 75 cents, but they don't take bills, so have change. ',GOOD,

Felix is the number one front desk man, he was amazing and actually put thought and effort into caring and giving us advice on where to go. ',GOOD,
'Nice small friendly hotel...working out the "kinks' As most recent reviews mention ,this is a nice small hotel ,great location and certainly a friendly staff, especially Felix (3PM-11pm) shift who gave us some great tips on nearby restaurants.(check out the Greek restaurant I think called Fleria and the Kasalta Bakery) .And there lies a problem...all the food places are at least 2- 5 blocks away...except the Wind Chimes(sister hotel) that is one block away and that is really just a bar with some ok breakfast .. .We had to catch an early flight home BUT there is no one one on duty 11pm -7am so we had no wake up call available and had to take our luggage and check out at the Wind Chime at 5:45 am . There was no info about check out and i learned by accident about what i should do to leave before 7am..Not a big deal but that plus thie littles like no restaurant or even morning coffee...construction of the new restaurant was ongoing and should be done in a week or 2..We walked down about 5 blocks on the beach and had dinner at Pamelas at the Number One hotel and I think for about the same price i would prefer the NO. 1 ...ON THE BEACH...some rooms with nice views ...maybe next time.

'The most comfortable beds in a hotel ever Stayed at the Monteleone over Christmas (excellent prices available over the holidays). Our room was 3rd floor right over the entrance, but the noise on Royal St. rarely bothered us over our 5 night stay. The beds are outstanding -- my wife and I both slept like logs. The rooftop pool is heated (really heated, like bath temperature) and we were lucky enough with the weather to spend Christmas day getting a tan drinking beverages that we bought in the Carousel (the poolside bar was closed for the winter and/or holidays I guess). Only real difficulty was the valet service which kept losing the info on our car and slowing us down somewhat (we were in no hurry, so no biggie). As it turns out, while we were waiting for our car in the lobby, we were twice entertained by Christmas activities (an adorable choir of 5-year-old girls and some historical re-enactor types including Papa Noel). All in all, very festive atmosphere at the hotel during ostensibly a dead part of the tourist season. Didn't eat at the Hunt Room or the Cafe so can't report on those, but did spend some time in the Carousel Bar, which is everything a good hotel bar should be (try the Abita Select on tap -- it's awesome!). And as everyone has pointed out, the location is great -- easy walking distance to Bourbon, Canal Street, the CBD, the riverfront, and the St. Charles streetcar. This was our second visit to the Monteleone, and it won't be our last. It's a lovely place with a great old-world vibe to it. ',GOOD,
'My personal preference -more sunlight and a better lounge. Just got back from New Orleans. Our stay at the Hotel Monteleone was just fine. The room was nice, no complaints. Make sure you ask for a room with a view, (may be an upgrade); certain wings of the hotel building are U shaped and the room windows face in toward each other. Everything about the hotel was very pretty, I just would have liked to stay in a hotel with more windows and sunlight and a nicer lounge area. The carousel bar was pretty, but small and the spinning I could do without!!! I'm really not complaining but to me a clean room is fine, it's the lobby, lounge, bar area that really make a hotel. We stayed with friends and we'd meet at a different hotel for a drink, instead of our own, before heading out. The Omni on St. Louis, and the Sonesta on Bourbon are places to check out if you enjoy a little relaxation and a nice cocktail before or after heading out into the fun of New Orleans!Go to Mr. B's across the street for lunch, a GREAT restaurant with a real old time business lunch feel.

'Historic Monteleone - beautiful and perfect location The hotel is beautiful and the location can't be beat. Book a room larger than just the standard room. The rooms are nicely furnished and beds are comfy. Everything was perfect during our stay but we did not have to valet park and the line Sunday morning for those retreiving their cars was quite long. The pool are is very nice and the pool was heated above 90 degress - it was in the 50's. The location is ideal. ',GOOD,
'Lovely Old World Charm I was in New Orleans attending a conference and did not have a choice in which hotel I stayed. This hotel turned out to be ideal. It is an older hotel with a lot of charm and character (I usually go for the more modern hotel when I travel in American cities). The location is perfect too, right in the middle of the French Quarter - a couple of minutes to walk to Bourbon St but just far enough away from the noise. The street itself has several good restaurants, gift shops, coffee shops etc. I walked to the famous Cafe Du Monde easily from here. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. ',GOOD,
'Think Twice Before Staying.... This letter is to inform you of our negative experience with the hotel鈥檚 valet service. Upon receiving our vehicle from valet, we were making sure our belongings were still there. We discovered that the emergency cash that was hidden in my car was missing. Only a person that put a lot of effort into digging through my car could have found this hiding place. After speaking with the transportation director he informed us that the valet is not responsible for our vehicle. We tried to self park the car upon arriving to the hotel but we were told we had no choice but to valet. This makes us suspicious that the hotel may condone the act of theft and possibly even promote the valets to thoroughly search each car to 鈥渟ee what they can find鈥?as a 鈥渂onus鈥? Although the manager spoke with us he did not seem very concerned at getting to the bottom of the situation. He seemed more concerned about getting us out of the lobby as to not cause a seen in front of other guest. After speaking with several other people from Baton Rouge about our experience, we were told other horror stories concerning Hotel Monteleone鈥檚 valet service that had taken place this Mardi Gras as well as for the Kenny Chesney concert just a few months ago. You can be assured that we will never return to this hotel and will be spreading the word to as many people as possible about our experience and the experiences we have learned about from our friends concerning your hotel. To add insult to injury we had to pay $30 for valet to rob us. ',POOR,
'Just OK Overall, a good hotel and a great location, but I was not totally happy with my stay because of issues with my room and the way they were handled.First, the good - The location is excellent. The hotel is located in the heart of the french quarter area -- very close to Burbon St., nice restaurants, bars, etc. The lobby is nice with plenty of places to sit.The front desk staff I interacted with was mediocre at best. I had questions about some of the well known establishments in the area, and they either had no clue what I was talking about or gave me completely wrong information about the location.Here is the bad. It pertains to the particular room I was in, so I would not say this is representative of the whole hotel. However, the service I received may be moreso. I went to use the sink in my bathroom, and there was no cold water. The handle wouldn't turn. I called the front desk, and they said they'd send someone right up. I left the room for a few hours, and when I returned, I noticed the sink still wasn't working. I called the front desk again and explained that nobody had been to my room yet, and it had been a couple of hours. He said he would take care of that right away. I again left the room to enjoy the town some more. When I returned again a few hours later, still nobody had been to my room. So, I called and requested a manager. I explained the situation to the manager and how this was my 3rd attempt to address the problem, and he said it was the first he'd heard of it. He was going to contact the maintenance guy immediately. I explained that I was going out again, and confirmed that I did not need to be in my room. When I returned later, there was a voice mail on my phone. (The manager said he'd leave voice mail with the results.) He said the maintenance man was unable to fix this issue. He said they were sold out, so I couldn't be moved to another room. He said that as a gesture of good will, he would leave 2 breakfast coupons for me at the front desk. The only other thing that was wrong with my room was that it was very warm and I didn't see a way to cool it. There was a thermostat on the wall, which was set at 55, but it was way warmer than that. I did mention this at check out the next morning to the front desk staff and to a manager (not the same one I'd spoken with the night before). The other issue that happened was when I went to check out and get my breakfast voucher. The front desk said they had no record of my issue or voucher. They called the manager, who did come down and agree to comp my breakfast.I booked my room through Orbitz, so I don't think there was anything they could do as far as refunding some of my money. ',POOR,
'Con artists at the front desk...with the best catering on the planet... Booked a Preferred King as part of a small group, had a personal email confirming my rate, room type, and checkin details. When I was presented with a paper to initial that said Traditional King, I asked why and was told they were Updating their website and this was the new name for the Preferred room. Got to the room, called my office to check in and explained what had happened, they volunteered to call the hotel and ask what the difference between the rooms was. As it turns out, I had been checked into a lower caliber room that should have been $30 cheaper. I returned to the front desk, and they were gracious enough to change the rate to what the room rents for that I was placed in, claiming they had overbooked, all an honest mistake. Sounds somewhat plausible so far? Well, another member of our group checked in next to me, he had booked the lower level Traditional King, and asked to be upgraded to the same room we had contracted for our group, the Preferred King at $30 more. They graciously agreed to allow him to do so, and charged him the $30 extra. But rather than check him into a Preferred King, they placed him in the exact same room he had originally booked, no upgrade whatsoever, just scamming him out of $30 per...If someone did this to you out on a street somewhere, the police would arrest them, beware, and consider bring the police with you to check in if you want to actually get what you are paying for...On the bright side, we had catered food and beverage service at our business meetings that was absolutely top shelf, with an impeccable staff...these folks deserve a 5 star rating, absolutely superb presentation, quality, and service.So...if you make it past the horse thieves at the front desk, you will be in for a rare treat when you eat... ',POOR,
'Great Location The Hotel Monteleone is perfectly located in the French Quarter, just one block from Bourbon Street and close to Canal and the River area. I spent two nights at the hotel during a business convention. The hotel is historic and there is a sense of old-world style as you enter the premises. The lobby is nice without being too elaborate. The staff was mostly friendly and helpful. The rooms are spreadout through about 14 floors and, as most older city hotels, there are lots of hallways. I suspect the size of the room depended a bit on which hallway you were on. My room was not very big ... except for the bathroom. However the bathroom space was not used very well. There was marble throughout the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room clean. There was a small desk with wired internet and the entertainment center doubled as a closet. TV was not great ... but your are not in New Orleans for the TV.Did not eat in the restaurants. But the main one (Hunt Room Grill) looked nice. The bar is unique as the stools rotate like a carousel. We ate at K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen a few blocks away which was excellent. The workout room was not very big but the machines were new and in great shape. As mentioned, the location is perfect and not overrun with Bourbon Street party-goers. If you are looking for a New Orleans experience, this is close enough to the craziness yet upscale and quiet on its own. ',GOOD,
'Great Place to Stay I stayed here for a week in November for business and was very pleased. The location couldn't have been more convenient.In the heart of the French Quarter on Royal St. convenient to restaurants, shopping, antique galleries etc. When I first checked in, my room was very small and overlooking some very unattractive roofs plus tv didn't work. So the guy that came up to try to fix the tv told me if I wasn't happy with my room I should ask for another one.Thank god I did. The room they switched me to was much bigger and overlooking the river. The only issue was the bathroom which was rather small. The staff was very helpful. Especially the doormen. David and Frederick to be specific. Very knowledgeable about places to eat. No real issues except the phone charges are ridiculous. They charge 80 or 90 cents for every local call. Needless to say I used my cellphone. Also charge for internet access if u want to use their DSL or Wifi. For the most part I recommend the Monteleone and would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Okay - not worth the price - Great Location- Good Bar in hotel- Medicore concierge service. Not very knowledgeable - Not worth the $200 dollars a night. Cheaper hotels with same amenities just two blocks away ',POOR,
'Little Murder, Little Mystery, Lots of Fun My husband and I, along with a pair of friends, stayed at the Monteleone for their Murder Mystery weekend over Halloween. We stayed three nights, two with the murder mystery event and a supplemental night. We were on the 4th Floor and had a great corner room. We could hear street noise and music, but it added to the stay, rather than being an annoyance. The room was clean and comfortable, very attractive. Linens, mattress and pillows were the perfect thing to come back to after a day of walking and enjoying the town. Turn down service nightly.The hotel was beautiful and close to everything. The rooftop pool and balcony were wonderful, we never did leave enough time for a dip though. Our mystery package included breakfasts, a lunch, a dinner and a cocktail reception. Food was great! We didn't try any of the on site restaurants through, the meals were all served in the Riverview Room.Of course we hit the Carousel Bar a couple times, what a great experience. The only negatives would be someone smoking in the room next to ours, the smoke came through the closed room adjoinng door. The other negative, the concierge wasn't very friendly. We were able to get better tips for restaurants and things to do from the staff members participating in the murder mystery weekend. ',GOOD,
'Cozy rooms, avoid the restaurants and the maidservice I stayed at the Monteleone for a week for business. The room was well-appointed, the location couldn't be beat, and the view was great. The staff were also, generally, fairly helpful. However, there were a few negatives that really turned me off of the place. The hotel seems much more interested in getting every last dollar from you than being hospitable. For example, the room mini-bars will automatically charge you if you even touch the thing too hard - it took my colleague 45 minutes at the front desk to get that sorted out. Another example - I wanted a plain yogurt from the restaurant instead of the large breakfast. They charged me $6 for a 3-oz (mini) yogurt because they were unwilling to price it a-la-carte. When I complained, they said that they don't make exceptions and I would have to pay the $6 (that would have been nice to know before they gleefully brought me the yogurt). Finally, another issue was the maidservice. I had to call and ask that the maidservice be discontinued because they rearranged everything in the room, including my toiletries and work-papers, to the point that I had difficulty finding things. I was also disappointed to see no recycling bins anywhere in the hotel for newspapers or plastic water bottles. Finally, the gym could have been nice, except that most of the equipment was broken. The rooftop pool also could have been nice, but it obviously hadn't been cleaned in awhile. ',POOR,
'Great place to stay in the French Quarter We stayed at the Monteleone Hotel for a four day weekend. The hotel was in a great location in the French Quarter. The service was excellent, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a little plain and small with a standard tub shower but was otherwise ok. The cafe in the hotel had one of the best breakfasts we had in NO during our stay. ',GOOD,
'Lovely Hotel ....awful treatment My daughter's wedding was out of town and in New Orleans. We booked a block of rooms. Due to the economic conditions, many people could not afford to travel and stay. Some booked cheaper hotels and we only ended up with 23 rooms. I booked my own room at the aarp rate, which was less than the rate we were given as a group.Before we arrived I noticed there were also cheaper rates available at Summit Hotel's website. I called the Monteleone to try to get our rate reduced and they would not change our group rate.When I checked into the hotel, they denied me the aarp rate since I was part of the wedding. Since I was staying 6 nights the differential was quite costly.They knew they had me. I couldn't check out because I had many guests coming. Instead of being well treated because I had 23 rooms, I was treated poorly.We had rented a car to run errands; parking was $30 a day. There was construction in the garage and getting the car took an average of 30 minutes. I was late for the wedding rehearsal, because it took 45 minutes to retrieve my car.My blazer was stolen from my station wagon as well.The wedding was fabulous. The Monteleone was not. ',POOR,
'Monteleone is the place to be for New Years Eve! We stayed in the Monteleone for New Years Eve for the Sugar Bowl game Georgia Vs Hawaii. The Hotel was amazing, check in was smooth and they still had the Christmas decorations up. The whole lobby was decorated with Christmas lights and trees. It was so quiet even on New Years Eve. The views were awesome from the pool deck you could see all of Bourbon street. Within walking distance of everything. I Highly Recommend. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful hotel. Great location. We checked in before check-in time with no problem. Our room was a superior double double. The room was somewhat small but by no mean unmanageable. We knew the rooms were small. Since there were three of us, there was just enough draw space and hangers for our clothing. Bathroom was nice but small with little counter space. With three women in the room we could have used more counter space but again we managed. The beds were very comfortable.The view was great. Our view was over the roof tops with a perfect view of the Mississippi River. We were fascinated with the traffic on the river. The hotel itself is very pretty and elegant without being stuffy. Everyone we encountered was professional and pleasant.The Carosel Bar was very nice and a great place to start a days activities or to end the day. It seems to be a very popular place. One night it was packed. The hotel location was PERFECT. One block from Bourbon Street. It was also very near the St Charles Streetcar which we got on to visit the Garden District. Easy walk to Jackson Sq and the waterfront. We ate breakfast at Le Cafe at the hotel which was good. Overall, the three of us loved the Hotel Monteleone and if we return would not hesitate to stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Reservation was not honored, staff was misleading, next time a different hotel We called the hotel to book a room in early September and were told no rooms were available for September 26. We were able to book a premium king on the hotel website for $179. When we arrived at the hotel we were told the the premium king was not available, but we could have a standard King with a view of the French Quarter for $139. We took the reduced rate and got a room looking into an airshaft between 2 wings of the hotel. I thought the room was OK, but resented the fact that the clerk told us the room had a view when he knew it did not. By the time we got to our room we were ready to start touring the French Quarter and I didn't feel like wasting our time arguing about our room and the view. Next time in New Orleans we will try a different hotel. ',POOR,
'Very nice stay We stayed at the Monteleone for three days at the end of September and enjoyed it a great deal. It's a clean, well-run hotel with attentive, friendly staff. It's also HUGE, but has a small hotel feel, and is unusually quiet given its close proximity to Bourbon Street. For price, location and quality, it's hard to beat the Monteleone. We'd certainly stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Worse Reservation Experience After calling repeatedly and not being able to get someone to make the reservation that I needed, I went in person to make the reservation. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes the front desk could not help me. They sent me to a phone to make the reservation. Again, the person on the phone was useless. They sent me back to the front desk. Once they were able to get the reservation made, they photocopied my license and credit card to pay for the reservation. When my parents went to check in they were told they did not have a reservation and of course my credit card information was not there so they would have to pay for it. I have never dealt with such an unprofessional business in my life. ',POOR,
'A wonderful experience I stayed here on business during 20-27 September 2008 in a Deluxe double-Queen bedded room. I had great views over the river from my room, even sitting in bed! Certainly pay the extra for deluxe rooms to get the good views. The hotel was fantastic - great atmosphere and ambience. Staff were very friendly and made you feel special. The revolving bar was great fun. Throughly recommended. ',GOOD,
'Monteleone Hotel perfect location Stayed for two nights at the Monteleone Hotel in New Orleans with my teenage son in August 2008. As the saying goes......location, location, location. It was perfect. One short block away from noisy Bourbon Street but close enough to be extremely convenient. The room wasn't large but it truely did not matter. It was large enough and fine. The conceige could have been a little more friendly/helpful but that would be my only very minor complaint. ',GOOD,
'Basically a good Hotel. We stayed at this property between Hurricanes Gustav  Ike, so we arrived the day that the Hotel had reopened. The Hotel dates back to 1886, when Mr Monteleone opened a 60 bedroom Hotel, today after extensions  refurbs the Hotel still has some original features, such as the Entrance Lobby  the Reception area,  now has almost 300 rooms. The Hotel is in a great location 1 block from Canal St  1 from Bourbon, so whilst you can walk to the seedy/bar nightlife, you are far enough away not to hear it constantly. Don't forget that New Orleans has 24 hr drinking!The rooms are good, spacious, large TV's  an old world charm. The bathrooms are excellent, but with odd features like the closet for clothes  cases being in the bathroom also. The breakfast buffet is excellent for $15. There is also a pool perched on the top floor, which sits alongside meeting rooms on the 15th floor, it's a tad strange but works none the less. Staff are pleasant but not overly so, I dont know if that was just the after effects of the Hurricanes. Of note is Miss Eva, the head concierge, who has been there for a life time  knows everybody  everyone, and as you would expect is a font of knowledge. I would recommend a very expensive drink in the Carousel bar, named as the Bar counter  seats actually revolve, once every 15 mins. Great to experience but a bit gimmicky!We would recommend this property very much, try to get a good deal on the Suites, great if your budget will allow. ',GOOD,
'Ok hotel in a good location! My family of four (2 adults  2 little girls) stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on the second weekend in August 2008. Our check in was ez and we were upgraded to a Deluxe room with a cityview on the 14th floor. This room was the size of a closet w/ no space for our suitcases nor drawers to put our clothers in. The room was not quite as clean as most hotels and the view was rather dull w/ rooftop  alleys to see (boring). One of the concierges was very unfriendly and she was very unhelpful  rude. The bellman/doorman were nice  accomadating when they were around (sometimes). The pool was nice on the rooftop although it needed some cleaning and was quite small. The fitness room was decent w/ enought cardio machines for most, but no free weights to be found. One day after sightseeing our room was not clean (and we arrived at 4pm) and called room service immediately. They came up in about 20 minutes or so.Thank goodness our room was free and will definitely not be staying there again. We stayed at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon St. two weeks prior w/ my family and found it much nicer, classier, much more friendly w/ better service and better rooms  pool. The pros: close to everything in the French Quarter nice lobbyCons: not too friendly/ small rooms/ service so=so/ rooms a bit dirty ',POOR,
'Great location My family stayed at the Monteleone last summer. The hotel was fabulous!! So far my favorite in New Orleans. The location is perfect and the room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Most of the staff were extremely friendly, the only problem we had was at check-in, I felt the lady at the front desk could have been a bit more courteous. All in all we loved this hotel and will stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Great French Quarter Hotel We stayed at the Monteleone August 15-21, 2008. I can't say enough good things about the hotel. Service, location, ambiance, friendly and helpful staff. We had a group of 9 people staying and everyone would come back. If you are looking to be close to things in the french quarter, but in a nice quiet sophisticated setting, this place is it. Rooms are a bit small compared to newer modern hotels, but full of charm. Real New Orleans character and charm. ',GOOD,
'Excellent older hotel in the French Quater We stayed at the Hotel Monteleone for 7 nights in August 2008. My husband was attending a conference and the Monteleone was one of the official hotels. We had a beautiful double room on the 9th floor facing north - despite being one block from Bourbon Street it was very quiet. We were always greeted by friendly doormen and the concierge was a real help. The lobby is incredible. Overall the atmosphere was great. We would definitely stay at the Monteleone again - the location, ambiance and price cannot be beat. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel, staff not so much We were very excited to stay here after reading the reviews. Check in time was 3 p.m. We were told at 11, after calling due to early arrival, that the room would be ready in a few minutes. We had lunch walked around and called back to check an hour and a half later, not ready, but they told us to head on in. We got there, parked the car ($20 per night), they told us the room would be ready in an hour. We went out to a local bar with live music, came back around 5, and our room still was not ready for us. We ended staying in a room with a view of a building vs. the river, which we paid for, without any reimbursement or exchange of service. The room was very nice and clean, quiet, the Carrousel Lounge was great and friendly staff. Do not order room service for breakfast, it was $70 for two. Overall, the check in service was not good, but the hotel was great, and I would give it one more try. Be adament about check in time. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Location! We spent a long weekend in New Orelans and found the city to be quite charming.Our stay at the Montleone was very nice. The location is wonderful. It is on an antique store lined street right in the heart of the french quarter and only steps away from bourbon street. The Good: LOCATION, roof-top pool (though they could use more space), spa is lovely, lobby is beautiful, room-service efficient, food good, carousel bar uniqueThe Bad: doormen not always around, not very accomodating when it comes to early check-in (there were many people left to their own devices in a torrential downpour! we came back soaked and were finally givein a room) bad view from our roomOverall, we would return to this hotel again if the price was right.

'Great Stay at Monteleone My husband and I stayed at Monteleone from July 20 to July 25. The hotel was wonderful. Check-in was a breeze. We reserved a king deluxe room and we were happy with the room (1439). We didn't have much of a view, but we didn't mind at all. It was spacious enough for the two of us; however, I think it would be a little snug for three or more people. The bathroom was pretty and roomy. Our room was cleaned every day between 11am and 4pm. We had turndown service twice. The hotel room suited our purposes and we got a great rate since it's the low season. The hotel pool area was nice and necessary in the heat. We did not use the spa, gym or the eat on the premises. The Carousel Bar is a little pricey (2 domestic beers was $11 including tip).One complaint - I don't use hotel room glasses. There is a shop in the lobby of the hotel where you can get disposable cups. However, the cleaning staff always throws them out, even if you hide them. Just a small gripe. ',GOOD,
'Lots to Love ~ Heads Ups Too~ 1st the pluses: great location, lovely hotel overall, pretty pool, nice staff, it's historic so there's that. We got a much-discounted price being there as part of a convention so price wise it was great for what we got.2nd the cons: there were people outside being raucous most nights, thought that died by 1AM or so and since we were trying to really 'use' our time, it didn't bother us that much. Housekeeping staff needs to learn English...pretty sure this is true of just about every hotel in the US about now but yeah, it was bad. We had 2 double beds in our room....which barely fit in our room and the bathroom, while pretty, was tiny. You can do better than this for a 4 star hotel in NOLA! The Carousel bar is way over-priced. Parking is over-priced too but I get that it's NOLA, post-Katrina so somethings will be more expensive. Would I stay there again at rack price? No. Would I stay there again, period? Maybe. There are many, many hotels in NOLA, never mind the French Quarter, so you have options galore. The people we were there w/had a much nicer room than ours...their room fit with the 4-star rating.If you're gonna stay there, I would say go all the way and get the biggest room they have. Pool, fitness room  meeting areas were fine; lobby is beautiful and parking staff were great...probably the best thing about the hotel was the parking staff! ',GOOD,
'Could stand some inprovement My husband and I chose this hotel to stay at while we were in town to celebrated Halloween. Being so close to my fav Acme oyster bar was great but this hotel has some improvemenst to make in service. When we arrived around 8pm, there were no door greeters or bellhops to help with our luggage. This is not something I am willing ot overlook at a hotel. However- a while later while leaving the hotel- I did see a bellhop. Our room was small but very beautifly decorated and the bathroom was very clean. I would have liked for the tub to have worked properly but the drain stopper was missing. We improvised and just made it by. Our bed was comfortable and the view was georgous-for New Orleans. My husband loved the heated pool and the seating was very adequate for sun bathing. I would have liked to have had a coffee maker in our room but the gift shop offered many choices of pastries and coffee. The seating in the lobby was nice and open. However- even though we did not drive- I noticed the parking garage was full and guest were upset. I would reccommend this hotel again- for the location and historic charm. ',POOR,
'Fantastic Hotel in Ideal Location! I was at the Monteleone Hotel in March for almost one week. From the moment you enter the charming lobby (which includes beautiful antiques), you are impressed with a sense of tradition and hospitality. Location:Ideal: I would say you can't beat the location...right in the heart of the French Quarter, without the noise and high energy of Bourbon Street. Service:PERFECT!!! Warm, friendly and attentive staff who are there to assist. Concierge was terrific! Also, the Front Desk Manager, Mr. Gary Crawford was so helpful and accommodating with a problem I encountered. He is truly a class above and beyond any other hotel manager I've ever dealt with: BRAVO!!!Room/hotel:Comfortable, fair size (none of the windows open), clean and well appointed (other than the sinks being small. The pool on the roof is pretty, with a great view, but tiny.Food:The Breakfast Buffet was excellent, but their main restaurant (Hunt Room, I believe) was FANTASTIC! I would say that from all the restaurents we tried in New Orleans, we enjoyed the food there the most (try the duck and fish: delicious)!Things to do:Make sure you take the steam boat on the grand Mississipi: it's relaxing and fun. Walking in the Old French Quarter was amazing, and if you happen to be in N.O. in March, make sure you check out the St. Patrick's Day Parade (not much advertised) in the suburbs: it was beyond anything I've exprienced when it comes to parades...and collected two huge bags full of colourful bead (which were thrown out to the crowds)! Advice:The spirit and people of New Orleans is remarkable and inspiring! I would just caution that at night, just keep to the main streets and be aware of the panhandlers! It is truly a magical, romantic town...and I'd love to back soon...maybe for Mardi Gras this time...and I'll surely be returning to the Monteleone Hotel! ',GOOD,
'Great Place-Great Price Stayed at Monteleone from 7/7 for three nights, Hotel staff top notch in every way. The place was super clean, staff a pleasure to talk to, 5 star place at 1 star price. Cant beat location either- one block south of Bourbon Street. ',GOOD,
'Billing Fiasco Our family had a block of 11 rooms reserved for an event. Our room was to be a double, as there are 3 of us. We checked in, gave our credit card information, and were given the keys to a fourth floor room.  No one was available to help with our luggage, so the 3 of us lugged it all to room 467, which turned out to be a king suite. We hauled everything back to the front desk, waited in a long line, and informed the staff person that we were given the wrong room. He told us there was no problem, he checked us out of room 467 and we were given the keys to room 471.  Our room was clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed. Although our room faced the street, it was quiet. Of course, there was an obligatory hair in the bathroom, but we have come to expect that in any hotel we stay at. The exercise room is exceptional, with an incredible view. Overall, we had a nice stay. Upon check-out, we decided to use another credit card than the one we checked in with. The 2-night stay, with parking, was $346.50. Almost 3 week's later I decided to check my credit card statement and saw that the initial card we used upon check-in had been billed, as well as the card we switched to upon check-out. The total combined charges for both cards (for a 2 night stay) was: $697.09. I called the toll-free number listed for the hotel and explained my problem. The girl who answered (I did not get her name, but she was in reservations) asked me if we had perhaps ordered room service to incur these additional charges! I was finally transferred to the credit manager's voice mail. I waited 3 hours and called back. I got the same girl in reservations who informed me it was 12:13 and everyone was at lunch. She reiterated the time of day before transferring me to Tania's voice mail once again. Within an hour, Tania returned my call. She listened patiently, did some research, and told me that I was billed for rooms 467 and 471.  I asked how this could have occurred and Tania told me my information was still imprinted on the portfolio for the original room and that when my brother arrived (the occupant of room 467), he was handed the keys and told he had already been checked in. Please note that my brother has an assistant who arranged the accomodations for all of us and I am sure he assumed she had handled his payment arrangements as well. He is important, whereas I have to do everything for myself!  Tania then explained that until my brother called with his credit card information, my erroneous charge could not be reversed. I asked Tania what would have happened if someone I didn't know had been given room 467....would I still be charged? She had no answer. I asked if the hotel would admit a mistake had been made. She replied, I wasn't there, so I don't know what really happened. What REALLY happened was that the front desk clerk left my credit card information on file to cover the charges of a room they initially gave me BY MISTAKE. Tania DID offer to call my brother for me to obtain his credit card information and offered to call me back when she had obtained the information.  The next day, I received a call from her co-worker. Jim said that David told him that I had authorized my card to be used for my brother's charges. I have no idea who David is and why he would say something that is 100% untrue. I then told Jim that I had called my credit card company to dispute the charge and he told me that it wouldn't matter...they have the signed portfolio for room 467 and it is MY responsibility to pay it unless my brother provides his credit information. I asked Jim the same question I asked Tania: What if a stranger had been given room 467? Jim told me that I should have asked the front desk clerk to hand me back the information I provided for room 467 when I was switched to room 471. I assumed that when I am told You have been checked out of that room, that I am not financially responsible for the room. My brother's assistant called the hotel this afternoon, provided the information, and my charges were reversed. The hotel will still not admit any wrong-doing, and although I was planning a return visit to New Orleans I certainly will never stay at this property again. ',POOR,

'Luxury Hotel: but don't use the glassware! Very large Luxury hotel; however, as is the rule now with luxury hotels that provide in-room glassware (coffee cups, wine and water glasses, etc.); Drink out of them at your own risk!!!! I routinely work in room during business stays, the Moneteleone was no exception. During our stay, I routinely watched as the staff cleaned our used room glassware and coffepot by simply rinsing them out in the sink and wiping them down with....yes....our used bathroom towels. This is apparently now a standard sinful practice coming to light in luxury hotels. How to quickly tell if this has happened in your room in this or any hotel? Look at the cleaning carts in the halls; if they do not have trays of sanitary wrapped glassware, then you can guarantee the glassware in your room has not been replaced and is instead getting the luxury wipedown. Those glasses may not have seen a dishwasher since they were first placed in the room when the hotel was first built.Will stay there again but will adopt the Motel-6 cleanliness standard and bring my own styrofoam/disposable drinking ware.

'Great stay!! Just came back from a 4 day trip to New Orleans, the hotel has an excellent location on a quiet St. just 1 block to Bourbon St., there is a pharmacy and a grocery store next to it. as well as great restaurants Mr. B's, Brennans, ACME oyster house ect. ect. The rooms are small but nicely decorated , clean and with a extra comfy beds. ',GOOD,
'Lovely beds! The bed took up most of the room, but it was huge and comfortable! The room looked out over the buildings in the area, which generally speaking, is not the high point of the French Quarter, it's what's inside! The bathrooms were immaculate and marble, good water pressure.Did not have much interaction with the staff, but I requested turndown service and it was provided immediately. I went back to my room about 5 minutes after making the call and she was already there! Was not ever bothered in the mornings by housekeeping, even on late ones.Last point - PERFECT location. Very close to everything delicious and good in the French Quarter. ',GOOD,
'Very nice. Old hotel that has been redone. Rooms and bathrooms were smallish but comfortable. Service was very friendly and helpful. Doormen were great! Pool on roof was enjoyable, Room keys didn't work majority of the time (went through 7 of them in 5 days). Missed room service one day but we were in and out repeatedly so it was understandable. Meals were pricey but food was excellent.In the middle of French Quarter and shops, restaurants and clubs. One block from Canal St and trolley, walking distance to riverfront with Aquarium, casinos, etc. Short cab ride to French Market area. Would certainly stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Skip the spa The hotel is fabulous the spa...not so much.Booked pedicure online and still had to call to make appointment. Most expensive overrated service. Unorganized front desk and had better service and better polish at neighborhood asian salons. Also, price on spa website is incorrect or I was overcharged. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful service! Hotel Monteleone is a wonderful, traditional New Orleans institution. It is in a fantastic location, only a block away from world-famous Bourbon Street, but you can't hear any of the noise associated with that. It is located on Rue Royal, which was steps away from some of the city's best restaurants: Brennan's and Court of Two Sisters. Finally, it's just a block away from Canal street and the famed St. Charles streetcar. My family and I loved the charm and ambiance of the hotel, especially the rooftop pool. The staff were all very accomodating, would stay here again in a heartbeat! The room was clean and large and felt roomy for 4 people. We stayed in a room near the elevator and ice machine, but it wasn't too bad. Loved everything about this hotel! ',GOOD,
'Classic New Orleans The Monteleone isn't a perfect hotel, but there are some really terrific things about it. We love the lobby, and spinning carousel bar....truly classic new orleans. The rooms are small, as others have written, but how much time do you spend in your room? They are very clean, and the beds are extremely comfortable, even if it might be getting close to time to rework the look of those draperies. We also love the rooftop pool for hot afternoons. The French Quarter is always loud, and you will get some street noise even on the upper floors, but that's pretty much every hotel in the area. The plus is that you are in spitting distance of all the great restaurants and bars, as well as the street car. Overall, this is a perfect hotel to experience what makes the city unique. ',GOOD,
'Great Getaway Just returned from a girls getaway to New Orleans. The hotel is beautiful, conveniently located and the staff is superb. The front desk had no problems with getting us 3 rooms adjacent to each other. They also didn't quibble when we needed to split the bill 6 ways. Elke the concierge was great and the bell staff was wonderful. The Rue Royal location is great for shopping and it is in a quieter portion of the quarter which is nice. The rooms are smaller, more like a European hotel, and the layout can be confusing, but it is an older hotel. It is immaculately kept. Spa Aria is fabulous, Le Cafe had a good and speedy breakfast and Carousel bar is a good place to hang out. The pool was also nice. My only complaint is that the toilet flush was a bit loud. ',GOOD,

'Beautiful hotel in excellent location If you want to experience New Orleans, stay at the Monteleone. The suite we had was huge with 1.5 baths and beautiful. The Carousel bar downstairs is a must-visit even if you don't stay there. Everything is convenient to the Moneteleone. You are on Royal Street with a look at the unique antique shops, yet only a block from Bourbon and all the action you could want. The area is very safe. Although I was there for a convention, I chose to stay at the Monteleone. I like staying in the Quarter, and I felt this was a better value and experience than the convention hotels. The rooftop pool is excellent and includes a bar. The day spa was wonderful, and I would also highly recommend it. I had a mani-pedi which was heavenly. I would return there for sure the next time I visit. ',GOOD,
'Very nice hotel to stay, close enough to everything, far enough from noise Just got back from my first visit to Nawlins, as they say. My stay at Monteleone was very pleasant and had a great time. However, for the benefit of other travellers I would like to point out what some may want to know, specifically about the room and common areas. I had booked as early as January for a conference I would later decide not to attend. For those who look for the bigger the better, the room was just big enough for the very soft king bed, a desk and chair and armoire for the television. For those who need a firm mattress for bad backs, you may want to ask for a bed board, although I never called to see if they offer this. The bathroom was also small but efficient for one, probably a bit of a challenge for those who need counter space. Plenty of mirrors though, I suppose to make the bathroom appear bigger than it really is? The room was fairly quiet, and had no trouble sleeping, although I could hear the muffled conversations of the guest nextdoor who had a small yapping dog. The window view was not particularly good; completely of rooftops and side of buildings, but who stares out the window anyway? The location was very convenient to Canal St, Bourbon St., all of French Quarter, Walgreens across the way. They also have a spa on the premises which I took advantage of for a facial and body treatment and asked to be charged to my room. The night before, they slipped a copy of my bill under the door and I found a charge from the spa that was not mine. The spa corrected the charge easily and I asked for an updated copy of my bill at the frontdesk. There are 2 restaurants, one for breakfast and lunch and the other for more elegant dining, I did not eat at either as there are sooo many places to chose from in FQ. The bar lounge has a fun carousel seating that turns slowly around, very unique to sit in for a drink. I did not view the rooftop pool or the fitness room. All in all, I would recommend this boutique hotel because of the location and price and staff. Kudos to their maid and bell service as well. I may add though that weather right now is extremely humid and I'm told the best months to go is early spring time as this is a walking town and much more enjoyable if your not sweating as soon as you exit the lobby. ',GOOD,
'Good stay. Not fabulous. Just got back from our quick anniversary trip to the Monteleone. It was fine. Good but not great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to check in. They were very busy.The lobby is nice. Our room was small and I agree with a previous reveiwer, not sure we got what we thought we were booking. We had a king room that was very small. Bathroom was tiny but immaculate. The room was pretty and very clean as well. It was very noisy. We could hear the plumbing from the other rooms around and the noise from the street below went on all night till about 5:00 in the morning. ',GOOD,
'Classic  Just got back from a stay at the Hotel Monteleone and only have great things to say about it -- and this from a picky and frequent traveler. The location is great -- close to everything in the French Quarter but on one of the quieter, more sedate streets. Still one block away from Bourbon, if that's your thing. The building itself is beautiful -- the shining white exterior is one of the prettiest sites in the city. Inside -- classic! We booked a riverview suite for a very reasonable price (average $189/night) and were delighted with the size, decor, ammenities -- everything. Large bedroom, king bed, view of the Mississippi, bath with a jacuzzi tub and separate 2 person shower -- the sitting room was large as well - - and with a separate powder room off of it -- so two bathrooms. The pool on the roof is small but a fun way to chill in the afternoon -- nice bar up there. Downstairs there's the Carousel bar which is beautiful and staffed by knowledgeable bartenders who actually know how to mix real drinks instead of pouring pre-mix out of jugs. Since Sunday was our 29th anniversary, I called Ms. Eva the concierge before we arrived and arranged for a special anniversary breakfast -- which came right on time -- delicious eggs benedict and chocolate dipped strawberries, with a bottle of champagne and a pitcher of OJ for mimosas. Couldn't have been lovelier! So, rave reviews here for the Monteleone. ',GOOD,
'Authentic and classic French Quarter Hotel We were thrilled with our choice of the Monteleone for our trip to NO for a business conference. Most of the other attendees stayed at the Marriott where the meetings were being held. We loved the fact that our accommodations were different than the generic, big box hotels in the area.First I will say the location is just perfect. Close enough to walk everywhere but far enough to avoid the noise of Bourbon St. The style, as mentioned here is more Old World...kind of on the feel of a Waldorf or Fairmont. We have a tendency to prefer contemporary or boutique-y hotels but the Monteleone really gives you a flavor for the history of the area.The lobby is very pretty and the staff very attentive and professional.If I had one complaint, I would make sure to ask what actually qualifies as a deluxe room. After reading the reviews here, I was sure to book the largest, nicest room category available below a suite. I'm not 100% sure we got what we reserved because the room was still quite small. It was a true King sized bed and there was enough room to barely make our way around but it was still small with only a very tiny peak of the river from our 6th floor room. The room and bathroom were immaculate however, seemingly recently painted. I usually bristle at ornate drapes and lots of fabrics in a hotel room but it was true to the French influence in the city and everything was fresh and dust free. Our view consisted of rooftops and buildings. As opposed to the comment on this board of noisy surrounds, we were quick to notice almost no noise (one of our main criteria for judging a hotel). That might have been because we faced away from the main street but we also heard no plumbing sounds or disturbances from the neighbors.That said, we spent very little time in the room.One of the most enjoyable aspects of the Monteleone was the lovely rooftop pool. A nice perk in a hot city. We would spend our day out and about, relax with a book poolside in the afternoon and then head out to the FQ for the evening. It made the day truly relaxing. They could use to add some umbrellas for shade however.All, in all, a very pleasant stay. ',GOOD,
'Highly recommend - Old World Charm Just returned from 4 nights in NO for Jazzfest and absolutely loved our stay at Monteleone. We booked through a family friend who happens to be a travel agent and were looking for a hotel that offered the charm and elegance you don't find at the usual names. This was exactly what we bargained for. Great location, one block from Bourbon and a 5 min walk to the river. Staff was exceptionally attentive and gracious. Every minor problem was addressed quickly and correctly. Our only issue was that our room (15th fl) had some water stains (and possibly mold starting) from a leaky roof. Rooms are small as stated in other postings but with the Deluxe room we had just enough space to be comfortable and unpack. Would definetly go back to the Monteleone. ',GOOD,
'A Poor Choice for New Orleans We booked a room at the Monteleone based on reviews we had read on this site as well as others. The room, supposedly a deluxe king, was small, unmemorable and smelled horribly of tobacco smoke. It was exceedingly noisy at night even with the window closed. The plumbing was excessively noisy; we could hear the shower and running water from adjoining rooms. When we arrived, the in-room safe was broken and had no instructions attached; it had to be repaired the next day. The hotel does not have complimentary wireless internet and charges an excessive fee of $10 per day for wired in-room access; at its room rates, free wireless access should be available to all guests. When we requested a late check-out on May 7th, we were first told that the very best we could do was 12:30 (normal checkout is at 12:00). When we pressed on this, we were begrudgingly told we could check out at 1:00, but it was clear that the clerk felt very put out by this. For a lodging that holds itself out as a luxury hotel and charges accordingly, I believe it falls very well short of the mark. There are far better hotel choices available in or near the French Quarter. I would not stay at this hotel again. ',POOR,
'Second visit to the Monteleone. I took my husband for his first visit to New Orleans. This was my second stay at the Monteleone and it was just as good as the last time, just with some bumps in the road. The staff is very nice and the property is clean (and the lobby always smells like fresh flowers which I just love!). This time we booked directly through the hotel and got the cheapest king deal that they had. My only recommendation is that if you are booking direct, get upgraded and don't take the standard/base rate King if you want a little more room. The room was itty bitty, but that's fine with us, we're in New Orleans and just happy to have a clean and safe place to rest at night. The only other problem was the walls were like paper and we could literally hear the two ladies next door speaking like they were right next to us and you could tell that they were speaking in reasonable levels. This was strange, because my last stay with some friends, our room was right near the elevator and we never heard a thing, so perhaps parts of the hotel were constructed at different times??? We asked for late check-out and the best they could do was an extra 30 minutes, so perhaps they had a large convention or its hotel policy, I was only upset by it because I just didn't want to leave :) It was fortunate that we did check out late because when my husband went to check out someone had used our room number to buy breakfast at the restaurant. The front desk was polite and the charge was promptly removed when we explained it was not our charge, so when you leave I would most certainly check out at the desk and look over your bill instead of automatic check out. In any case, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit New Orleans. Our visit wasn't perfect, but it was fun and the staff at the Monteleone was wonderful. It's only a hop, skip and a jump from Bourbon and I have always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night which is a huge selling point when in NOLA. Have fun, be safe and let the good times roll!

'JazzFest 2008 - Great Time - Great Hotel Our group had been planning our JazzFest 2008 trip for about 6 months. We were going to stay at the Omni Royal Crescent but the rooms were too expensive so after reading the reviews on TA about the Hotel Monteleone we decided to stay here and we were very pleased. Check in was a breeze and they put us in adjoining rooms which were spacious. We were in rooms 1146 and 1145. 1145 was a corner room with two side being windows. The bathrooms were a little small but manageable. We paid $249 a night right off of their own website which was a good price for Jazz Fest weekend. The location is great! We especially liked the Walgreens right across the street to buy water and sunscreen except for Saturday when it rained all day. The carasoul bar is nice yet hard to find a seat. We ate at Mr. B's Bistro across the street the first night and had a wonderful meal. The pool was fun on the roof and they had a little pool bar up there too. The lobby is beautiful and the hospitality of everyone couldn't be nicer. I liked that they had a computer that you could print your plane boarding pass off on. All of our group were completely satisfied with the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Good, but not great... The good: It's a beautiful hotel with a cool carousel bar and, if the French Quarter is your game, the location is pretty much perfect. Service was excellent and very accommodating, from behind the desk to the concierge. The gym was actually better than expected and the pool was pretty nice. It was closed on the day of arrival, so I can't give a full review. It had water! That's about it. But it looked like a great place to relax, up on the roof, with a nice view.The sorta bad: Loud! This is the fourth hotel I've stayed in in NO, to include two very cheap motels back in the day, and this was easily the loudest. I get the people returning from drunken revelry, and I can live with that, but hearing the X-rated grunts and groans from neighbors is a little much (the neighbors are as much to blame as the hotel on that one). I felt like I was on a San Fernando Valley movie set. Also, as mentioned to exhaustion, the rooms are microscopically small. After reading reviews, I purposely booked a deluxe room (supposedly larger and one promising a good view). I had to go back to the desk to confirm it was a deluxe room. It was.Still, it was a very nice hotel and very clean with a friendly staff. It provided a great central location to return to amid sightseeing and the lobby bar was a great place to hang out. So good, but not great. ',POOR,
'Seen better days We chose the Monteleone over the Omni after reading reviews that made them sound like comparable hotels.We reserved a deluxe room for four nights and at check in, requested the largest available but were told there weren't any larger rooms. Instead, we were given a tiny room right off the elevator. We were shocked to see the room. The furniture was shabby and damaged - we've stayed in Holiday Inn Expresses that were nicer. There was also a notice letting us know the pool would be closed the following day, so if we wanted to swim, we could walk over to the Omni and use its pool. We called the front desk to tell them of our disappointment with the room and were immediately moved to a new room. This room was larger but had very noticeable stains on the carpet and more damaged furniture. We couldn't believe a hotel that bills itself as four-star was this shabby.That evening we walked by the Omni Royal and decided to check out what we had passed up. The front desk staff quoted us a rate that was $20 a night cheaper than what we were paying at the Monteleone and showed us a roomy, clean, well-maintained room. ... When we got back to the Monteleone, we couldn't get into our room because the key card wouldn't work. My husband went downstairs to the front desk to have it fixed, came back up to the room and the card still wouldn't open the door. So he had to go back a second time. ... We decided we'd be checking out the next day and moving to the Omni. The Monteleone staff grudgingly let us go without charging us a second night as a penalty. But they wanted to know why we simply didn't ask them to move us to a THIRD room that might be move in line with our expectations.Over at the Omni, we had a great stay. The staff was fantastic. When we checked in, they gave our daughter a little backpack filled with toys and treats. The rooftoop pool and bar were great. ... We definitely recommend the Omni over the Monteleone, especially if you have kids.... ',POOR,
'Might return, might not..... Most of the previous reviews had it right. First the bad: the room was so small that when the dresser drawers were open, you could not walk past the bed. At the end of my first day, I returned at 4:30 PM after walking all day and found that the room was not made up. When I called housekeeping, they informed me that they had until 5 to make up the room and if I wanted early cleaning, I should schedule it. So for the next 3 days, I asked to have the room made up by 1 or 2 pm. And it worked - they got the message. But at a 4 star, you might expect turn down service, not a cheeky we have until 5 to clean your room.On the good side, everyone except housekeeping was helpful and pleasant. I arrived late, nearly 10 PM and checkin was prompt and efficient. The room was clean and the bathroom was large. The AC had a thermostat so you could turn it off/on and set the temp. The halls were quiet. It was a great location and felt very safe. There was an ATM in the hotel - very handy and a FREE Internet kiosk to print boarding passes and check flight status. ',GOOD,
'Great location, but... We picked this hotel because the conference my wife was attending was headquartered there. The location was really fantastic, right on Royal and only a block from Bourbon. We were lucky enough to get one of the larger/newly renovated rooms. The room was clean and modern, but nothing to write home about. We saw the room of our not-so-lucky friends and it was extremely small with a tiny bathroom and ancient looking fixtures. On the plus side, the pool was a pleasant way to take a break from the day's activities--there is ample sun-bathing space and a pool-side bar. My biggest complaint was that we were not permitted to enter our room until 5pm. They stored our luggage, and there was obviously plenty to keep us busy around the French Quarter. But we arrived at the hotel from the airport at 11am. No one at the check-in desk was interested in making sure that we were placed in a first available room. We sat in the lobby watching people arrive at 3pm and promptly receive there key. I have never had to wait so long to get into my hotel room. Next time, I'll try a new place. ',POOR,
'Value is in the location, not the tiny room Was exctied to stay at the Grande Dame of New Orleans hotel and sure enough it was a lovely property. Impressive lobby, nicely appointed.Location in the heart of the French Quarter was very convenient (watch the block between the hotel and Canal Street though, pretty gamey even to a NYer.)Booked a deluxe King sized room and can't imagine what was deluxe about it. Room was tiny (so tiny that amoire doors had to be pushed in so one could pass by -- there was about 12 inches between armoire and bed!) Small bathroom with cheap toiletries. Windows were painted shut, and impossible to open, deluxe room did not have a balcony Large HVAC unit outside the room hummed all night.On the plus side the hotel offers smoking rooms, has a good gym and a pretty roof top pool. Hard to put a finger on it, but overall was disappointing. Nice that it wasn't a chain or a flop house but was absolutely not worth price of $339 that we paid even with convenient location. ',POOR,
'Perfect Location We chose this from a list of conference hotels for its perfect location in the French Quarter. We found it good value for money and it has a bit of old world fading grandeur about it which is attractive in the splendid lobby but less welcome in the smallish slightly worn rooms and tiny bathroom. The minibar was poorly stocked (or maybe not to our taste). Inroom internet charges are ludicrously high--why do hotels charge for a service which costs them so little? But service was good, always friendly and the two concierges, Eva and Cleatter (yes that's how it was spelt; it's a Creole family name)were superbly helpful. Rooms were made up after lunch, too late in our view and there is no turn-down service or refreshing of towels. If you want your sheets changed you have to leave a card requesting it--with the usual 'spiel' that they're trying to be green: maybe, but it feels like they are trying to be cheap. Everyone raves about New Orleans cooking; we found it good if rich but a bit 'samey' in the well known spots. The Hunt Room in the Monteleone provides competent cooking in the genre. There are more atmospheric places. And if your head isn't spinning before a cocktail in the Carousel Bar it certainly will be afterwards, if only because your seat revolves around the bartender, but it's a popular spot and a bit of fun in this Grande Dame of a hotel. Overall we'd recommend and go back. ',POOR,
'Highly Recommended !!! We just got back from a great 3 night stay at the Hotel Monteleone. Our suite was on the 4th floor without a view and very spacious. The room d茅cor was nothing spectacular but the attention to detail was impressive. Our room was spotless everyday, not one hair or bit of dust left behind. Also, there was nightly turn down service and little extras that made it seem a lot more like a 5 star hotel. The location was perfect if you do not want to be in the heart of Bourbon Street were it can get a little rowdy, but close enough to partake in the party if you chose too. The rooftop pool was small and it was difficult to secure a lounge chair but the gym was well equipped so that you would not have to wait to use the machines. Overall we had a great stay at and I highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'No complaints Based on 3 different travel guides, I booked the Monteleone for my 12 year old son and me to stay 4 nights. I have no major complaints, but I caution anyone who reads those books to read the fine print; despite many glowing reviews about the newly renovated HUGE rooms, our room was so small that we literally had to move furniture in order to OPEN the suitcase. TINY. It was clean, it had a view of the Mississippi, and all worked well..but it was tiny. Front desk friendly but not entirely informed Other staff seemed kind of uninvested or not able to speak English, so communications were garbled. It's in a great place, it's got history, and it's clean and fine...but I never felt that anyone there had any clue who I was when I entered or any concern that I have a good time. I really don't want to sound too negative, but I guess I felt like a number in a place where I hoped for more. That said, we were never unhappy, and if I lived in a city that went thru Katrina , I wouldn't much care about the northern girl and her son, either. I wouldn't have trouble recommending the Hotel--I just was selfishly hoping for more. ',POOR,
'BAD, Hotel Monteleone On 03/21/08 had received a confirmation of our standard double room + free upgrade upon checkin via Book-it.com. This was pre-paid in full. On our arrival and attempted check-in at the Monteleone were abruptly and rudely told our booking agent overbooked and they did not have our room. Tine, the check in staff could not find accomodations to fit us. A self proclaimed front desk manager stepped in explained it was book-its fault they overbooked not the hotel. I tried to explain and show him we have a confirmation number. He did not want to listen, nor were we given any other room options. The only offer he gave would not have accomodated us. 2 adults, and an adult sized teen son, would not be able to stay in a standard room w/a roll away at an additional charge of 25.00 for the roll away. We left upset and angry. And are now fighting all involved to get our refund for a room we never stayed in. This is a travel Nitghmare !!! Now they saying we never arrived at the hotel, funny we have a dated picture of the clock in the lobby, and our luggage tickets from valet parking. This is not worth the trouble do not stay here!!!

'Loved the Monteleone A perfect experience! My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Monteleone. Our room was lovely, on the 14th floor, with a view of the river. While it was not huge, it was comfortable, and spacious enough for us to eat a (delicious) room service dinner on our first night there quite easily. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The bathroom was also comfortable and roomy enough for both of us to use at once (with one person at the sink while another used the shower or tub). What sold us was the impressive view of the river, which took on a romantic life on its own at night (with thanks to Sting, oh, is there ever a moon over Bourbon Street, and over the Mississippi). If you get a chance, check out the lovely, heated pool (my husband went for a morning swim every morning).The staff was warm and helpful, and a particular thanks to Eva, the concierge, who was helpful at every turn. This is a beautiful hotel with character and history. The kind of place where the staff goes out of its way to learn your name and your tastes. It truly is the grande dame of the Quarter, and we will return. ',GOOD,
'Great Experience at the Monteleone-Not for the Budget Conscious My husband and I stayed the Hotel Monteleone in November of last year for a wedding. It was our second stay at the Monteleone and a really great experience. The hotel is beautiful and in a perfect location in the French Quarter, Bourbon Street is a short walk away, but far enough away that the noise won't keep you up at night. It is surrounded by beautiful art galleries, which are a wonderful distraction during the day. The hotel room itself is beautifully decorated, but very small. I would not recommend the Monteleone for anyone traveling with children (heck, I wouldn't recommend New Orleans for anyone traveling with children.) However, it is a very romantic hotel and perfect for a couple's getaway.Just one word of caution, don't go to the Monteleone without expecting to spend a lot of money. We had room service for breakfast one morning. Two simple breakfast entrees and a pot of coffee came to $52.00 including tip. Also, the Carousel Bar is definitely not for the budget consious. I ordered a glass of house wine and was surprised to see that their house wine is $13.00 a glass. I also hear that parking is very expensive, but we have never used a car in New Orleans.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Monteleone to anyone who is looking for a romantic getaway to New Orleans and doesn't mind paying for the experience. It is definitely worth it. ',GOOD,

'The most perfect hotel in the French Quarter! Before booking the Monteleone, I read that it was the Grand Dame of the French Quarter. What an apt description. This hotel is absolutely breaktaking. We just gasped when we entered the lobby. It's like being whisked back in time to the time of the Great Gatsby! No wonder so many notable writers took up residence here.The staff is incredible. So friendly, helpful - anything you need, any time - they are ready, with a smile and a fabulous attitude. The concierge was especially helpful in getting us where we wanted to go. The room was beautiful. Very small, which is an issue for some - but you need to remember that 100 years ago, that was the norm. A small room only adds to the character of an historic hotel. The decor is beautiful and the toiletries are fantastic. Be sure to ask for a river view!The Carousel Bar is a welcome retreat after a long day in the city and a long night ahead. The bartenders remembered our names (heh heh - can't imagine why) and were friendly and entertaining. I can't say a single negative thing about the Monteleone. I will only stay here whenever I am in New Orleans. It's is located in the best part of the quarter on Royal Street - sitting nicely on the sidelines of the action which is only a stone's throw away. ',GOOD,
'Loved Monteleone I went to New Orleans from Feb 15-18 of 2008. I was in New Orleans for All Star Weekend. This was my first time in New Orleans and certainly will not be the last.. I read quite a few reviews on this hotel as well as many photos. I must say that I was truly impressed with this hotel. Right in the downtown area of the French Quarter and one block over from the famous Burbon Street. The rooms were great and spacious, there were safes, nice thick bathrobes and very big windows looking out from the street (at least our room we stayed on the 4th floor Non-smoking floor). The rooms were clean and the cleaning staff was very courteous. Nice size bathrooms. The hotel lobby was elegant and just very relaxing. We had a rooftop pool, and a gym never made it there but a friend of mine said it was great and heated. The atmosphere was great the front desk was also very friendly (No Problems). There was a restaraunt on the main floor the Breakfast Buffet was great, alot of variety and not bad for the price.. Overall this experience was great I would definately stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Lovely hotel with great location My husband and I arrived here right after Mardi Gras. It is a very nice hotel with friendly staff, good food in the restaurant, a nice bar and perfect location in the French Quarter. We really had a good time here. The room was small with no view, but that does not matter as we do not spend much time in there. The only problem was were to put our suitcases. There were room for one suitcase in a closet, which made it very difficult to hang clothes there. Another time we will ask for a bigger room.Carousel Bar in the lobby area is nice and a little fun that it is spinning slowly around. Bathroom was clean and nice, too little light though.Breakfast buffet (or menu if you preferred to order) was very good and so was the service. The only people that did not seem to bother so much, was in fact the people at the reception desk. They did not smile, they did not look at us, did not talk to us, they just pressed the buttons on their computers when we appoached them with some issue.This hotel also has a nice pool and garden on the roof. We sat there and relaxed a couple of times. Had a nice view of the city as well. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful historic hotel My husband and I had stayed at the Hotel Monteleone in the early 1980s, and it wasn't a very good experience, so we were amazed by the vast improvements that have been made since then. The hotel now is lovely and well-maintained, and the staff people we encountered were unfailingly friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't large, but it was very well-appointed. I was in New Orleans for a conference, held at the Hotel Monteleone, and I was especially impressed by the quality of the food served in meetings and, even more, by the level of service. In addition, the hotel is in a great location for visitors who want to explore the French Quarter. ',GOOD,
'Great Location, Nice hotel We came in after Mardi Gras to celebrate our anniversary. This was our 1st trip to NOLA. This hotel is beautiful and has a lot of history. It also has a unique bar, Carousel. The room wasn't very big but we didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room anyway. The shower/tub was rather large for as small as the bathroom was and the water pressure was great. The only negative to our room that some may be upset about would be the view....there was none, unless you like to look at the tops of other buildings. The concierge helped us numerous times. The location of this hotel is perfect in that we were able to walk just about everywhere. There was a small issue between the doorman and the taxi service when we were leaving that was a little uncomfortable but it didn't delay us very long. We would definitely consider staying here in the future if we were able to get another good deal. ',GOOD,
'True French Flavor in the Quarter Without question and excellent hotel with quality staff and ornate property with flare and panache. A must on your trip to N'awlins......... ',GOOD,
'Loved the Monteleone My husband and I stayed at the Monteleone just prior to the start of Mardi Gras. The staff was gracious and friendly, the room small, but clean, with a great view of the Mississippi River. The Carousel Bar is a must see. Overall, I would definitely stay at the Monteleone on our next trip to NOLA. ',GOOD,
'Would stay again in a minute Just back from Mardi Gras where I spent four nights at the Monteleone. Location was perfect, close to Canal and Boubon (a block from each) but still on a fairly quiet block. Beautiful old hotel, very nicely furnished, friendly staff. Our deluxe king bedroom was fairly small but not tiny. The rotating carousel bar was remarkable - so was the fact that Pete Fountain and his band stopped by and played on Fat Tuesday. I would definitely stay there again especially for Mardi Gras. ',GOOD,
'Very Nice Hotel We went to New Orleans to work on some company equipment nearby and stayed 4 nights. Check-in was very fast and with a friendly staff. I got up to my hotel room and it was clean, but very small. I had a king size bed that took up most of the room. I didn鈥檛 mind that too much since I was not there most of the time. The view out the windows was a wall but again I was not there to stay in the room. Getting the car each morning was quicker than I had expected after reading some of the other reviews. We were on our way each morning with about a 5 minute wait. One block off of Bourbon Street made the location great. The only minor negatives I can say was the view and the size of the room. Overall, we had a great time. ',GOOD,
'Nice stay - great location I stayed at the Monteleone twice in 2007. One was for a work conference and the other for a weekend get a way with my husband. On both occasions I found the rooms very nice (not large) and the staff accommodating. On the trip with my husband, I made a mistake regarding what type of room/bed I wanted. The front desk was able to accommodate our request and switch our room. This type of service is great to have - when so many front desk personnel at other locations can be rude. The location of the hotel is superb for those who want to be very close to Bourbon street but do not want to be kept up all night due to the noise on Bourbon street.If I had to make one suggestion to improve my ranking of the hotel it would be the concierge. Having been there twice and for stays more than 2 nights - the concierge appeared more interested in plugging some of the high end places rather than making recommendations for the moderate budget. (And let's face it you can only eat so much.) ',GOOD,
'Nice hotel... considering it's a block off Bourbon Street This was my first trip to New Orleans and I was there for the BCS game. The hotel was nice, staff was pleasant, although the rooms were small - but that's city life. The elevators remain very busy - sometimes it took us 3 or 4 cars to get on one. The location is central to everything though and all sorts of transportation. Bourbon Street is a block away and depending on what side of the hotel you're in, you'll have a view and hear some of the noise during the busy season. And because of the location and busy-ness, you feel okay walking late at night. And with Bourbon Street right there, people are up all hours. Nice perk - there is a Walgreens right on the corner - it's open until about 10.I still don't know what to make of New Orleans. Bourbon Street was not really my scene, but some of the other parts had some cool history. ',GOOD,
'Great Stay at Hotel Monteleone We stayed at the Monteleone for the National Championship Game. Unfortunately the Buckeyes lost but we enjoyed our stay. The location was excellent, close to Bourbon St and Decataur St. I would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Love This Hotel!!! I was fortunate enough to be able to stay at this lovely hotel for several nights each, within a few months period of time for two different conferences. The first conference was for a large group of blind people. The hotel went out of their way accomodating everyone and training their staff in some of the needs of blind folks, making sure obstacles were not in the way, helping people in the restaurants, etc. The kindnesses shown by everyone at the hotel were amazing! Then when I arrived a few months later, the doorman remembered me!! Wow! was I impressed! The location is wonderful for the French Quarter, walking distance to anywhere. even Harrahs Casino and all the fun places around there. The Carousel bar is a fun place to start the evening or end the evening. Last time I was in New Orleans, I had to stay at the Sheraton on Canal Street and it was just like being in any big chain hotel in any city. Not like the Hotel Monterleone with its historical character and wonderful caring staff. I did not have a car but I understand that having to park a car is very expensive and time consuming. ',GOOD,
'Average, but historic and good location for Bourbon Street This was our first trip to New Orleans and probably our last. It was just not our cup of tea. We arrived late at night after driving for hours in the pouring rain. The weather was unseasonably cold for our October stay. We hadn't eaten and were directed to a family friendly restaurant on Bourbon Street, well within walking distance. The food was excellent, but this restaurant as well as most decent ones in New Orleans were really over priced. We stayed for two nights at the Hotel Monteleone and ate at one of Emeril's restaurants a few blocks from the hotel. Although a nice experience, it was close to $100 for two of us and it was nothing spectacular. His other New Orleans restaurant would have cost us $100 per person - outrageous!The hotel Monteleone for us was average. The room was on the small size with a nice view of the harbor. It was nice watching the barges, but the bathroom was also very small and the mattresses were terrible. The breakfast buffet (not included) was excellent with a lot of hot choices as well as cereals and fresh fruit. The staff were nice, the hotel was clean, well located and the decor was very nice and historic. If you want to be close to Bourbon Street, this would be a good option. ',POOR,
'Perfect blend of history        New Orleans Monteleone Christmas ',GOOD,
'Great weekend at the Hotel Monteleone Its location in the French Quarter is outstanding...right in the middle of it all and only one block off of Bourbon Street. The history of the hotel is evident in its beautiful lobby and the Carousel Bar. Rooms are relatively small, as one would expect in a 125 year old hotel. Bathrooms are also small but nicely furnished with marble tile and lots of mirrors. I cannot speak to the hotel's restaurants or room service...why eat hotel food in NOLA?!? ',GOOD,
'Monteleone okay but... Stayed at the Monteleone 2 nights before Christmas cruise. Unlikely to stay again (read Cons). Pros:Check in a breeze. Friendly staff. Rooms clean, small, but cozy. Great location in French Qtr - everything within walking distance. Wonderful appearance of a grand hotel. Beautiful view and comfortable sitting area and pool on roof.Cons:Parking is non-existent. Be prepared to pay daily storage $30/day +. Room service poor - did not bring requested breakfast two mornings in a row even after taking the request to the front desk. Retrieving car a nightmare. Normally at luxury hotels one can call the valet to have the car ready at check out to avoid needless delay. We were told to check out first then walk to the garage and wait with a large group of other guests. It took 50 minutes of waiting in the cold for my car. What was supposed to be 1st come 1st served - was not. I guess I should have thought to slip a 10 or 20 spot to someone to get moved to the front of the line. Summary - I doubt I will stay at the Monteleone again There are too many other choices. I will probably stay at the bigger chain hotels at the edge of the French Qtr. ',POOR,
'Grand Hotel, Great Experience After a year of research, my husband and I chose this hotel and stayed for 2 nights in December 2007, after a cruise. This one of the most beautiful rooms I have ever stayed in, and we have travelled alot. We had a suite upgrade, courtesy of the Hotel. Tastefully decorated, huge 2 room suite with a jacuzzi tub and second powder room. Quiet location on the eighth floor with a river view. The staff was courteous and helpful - the front desk, bellman, wait staff, and housekeeping. My husband and I had spa treatments - very enjoyable. I would say this is the Grand Dame of New Orleans accomodations. We can't way to come back !!! ',GOOD,
'My New Favorite Hotel in New Orleans I've stayed at just about every hotel in the French Quarter and I have to say the Hotel Monteleone wins for best 'all-around'. It is situated in the perfect spot, just one block from Bourbon Street on Royale. You're right across the street from Mr. B's Bistro, one of the best restaurants in town, and just down the street from Acme Oyster Co. Royale is lined with great antique shops and you're only a short walk to Jackson Square, the Riverwalk and Canal St. The Monteleone's lobby is really beautiful, especially during Christmas, and we met some wonderful people - and bartenders - at the famous revolving Carousel Bar. if you don't mind paying $15 for a martini, a GREAT martini, it's worth a look. Our room was on the 14th floor and we had a view of the river. It was super clean, well appointed and supplied Caswell-Massey soaps  shampoos. The king-sized bed was super comfy.The staff was prompt and super courteous, our room was cleaned every day and best of all no one came knocking when we slept in until 11am!Overall, I highly recommend the Hotel Monteleone and we will stay there during our next visit. ',GOOD,
'Very nice hotel, exceeded expecations I was resistant to staying at this hotel after I saw that the J.W. Marriott had an amazing rate that same weekend. However, we missed the cancellation deadline, so we kept this reservation. The desk clerk at check in was extremely nice, and upgraded us to a larger room than we would have had otherwise. This may have made a difference to my overall experience if we had been in the small room. The only downside is that we were right by the elevator and ice machine. I noticed the ice machine noise a few times in the morning, but it wasn't bad at all.When I first walked in, I noticed a kind of wet smell to the room, the kind of smell common to post-Katrina areas. However, I never noticed the smell again.The rooms were spotless, and looked newly decorated. The wallpaper, curtains, and carpets were flawless. The beds were heavenly and soft (as good as a Westin). My friend and I could barely get ourselves up out of bed. Bathrooms were nice and spotless as well. Great location, close to shopping, restaurants, and Bourbon street. I noticed some complaints about noise in other reviews, but our floor seemed very quiet. Granted, we were out until 3 in the morning both nights...so we may have missed some of it.I would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Crowded but cozy I stayed one night for a business meeting at the hotel. The room was small but clean and comfortable. Not luxurious but better than average. I didn't hear any noise and slept well, however a few others in our group staying on different floors complained about late-night parties in rooms and corridors.The actual meeting room was too small for our group - we had to add tables and chairs despite having told them in advance what we needed. The promised coffee service didn't arrive in the morning until we asked several times. They served us breakfast and lunch the food was above average.The lobby was usually crowded and I had to stand in line to check in, check out, and leave my bags with the bellhops since I arrived before the room was ready.Nice location for walking around the French Quarter - lots of shops and restaurants nearby. ',GOOD,
'Greatly improved, the Monteleone My previous experiences with the Monteleone were a little disappointing. But, after re-modeling, I will stay there again. The rooms were beautiful and it is in a great location. A+++ Staff is quite cordial. ',GOOD,
'Great French Quarter Hotel Great hotel. Excellent location. The double-deluxe room we had was small, but very clean. Nice marble bathroom. The only problem we had was with getting hand towels and washcloths. We had only one hand towel the entire 3 nights we were there, and there were similar problems with washcloths. Housekeeping promised to deliver some, but never did.We'd booked 3 1/2 months ahead of time and requested a river view room, but did not receive one. The staff was a little snippy about it. Otherwise, we did enjoy our stay in the hotel. ',GOOD,
'WONDERFUL STAY The Hotel Monteleone is a gem in the heart of the French Quarter - the rooms are spacious and clean. Remodeled bathrooms with marble and great linens and bedding. Staff is responsive and courteous -- walking distance from everything! I would highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Great time in the French Quarter! We stayed here in November for a long weekend.I was so impressed with this hotel. It is hard to believe it is as old as it is. After some initial confusion with our rooms, we were very happy with the condition of the rooms and the hotel. Everything was spotless. In one word I would say magnificent. Service was great also. I can't say anything about the food since we never ate there. Rooftop pool is very pretty and the view is awesome.I also couldn't get over how spotlessly clean the French Quarter was. We walked all over and many time we would pass people sweeping and cleaning.Bourbon Street is a lot of fun. We will go back since there are lot's of things we didn't get to do. And we will stay at the Hotel Monteleone again. ',GOOD,
'Loved It! After leaving one hotel earlier that day due to its substandard quality, the Hotel Monteleone was a wonderful upgrade. The hotel is rich with history, in an ideal location in the French Quarter, provided quality, professional service, and was overall well worth the price. Having stayed in many hotels in New Orleans, this would be my favorite. While the tourism in New Orleans is still lower than it years pre-Katrina, it is well worth the trip. Would return in a heartbeat. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful location What a hotel,Looks so appealing from the street, nice old building. Then you walk inside and wow. Very graceful.Staff great and very helpful.Rooms a nice size and very well appointed. Had a nice veiw over roof tops and onto the Mississippi River.Elevators location can bit a confusing. 3 different shafts bring you out at different places on the lobby floor.Roof top pool is fun and a great view. Gym is average but you can get a desent work out.The hotel location can't be beat. One block from Burbon Street in the middle of the French Quarter. And within easy strole of the river and shopping areas.If you go make sure you venture (in car or bus) to parts still effect by the hurricane. It is amazing the damage it caused. ',GOOD,
'Monteleone Hotel, New Orleans... Perfect Location, Nice Rooms, a Winner! I can't think of a better location, unless you have a view of the river... one very quiet and upscale block off Burbon Street . The hotel was very clean and nicely decorated in a modern New Orleans style. We had lovely arched windows (7th floor, facing front) and, though we were near the elevator, it was very quiet. (previous posts have said it was noisy... it simply wasn't for us.) The concierge was very helpful and there was always someone posted at the door to help you in or out. Didn't eat there... but ate across the street at Mr. B's Bistro, which was full with local lunchers-- brought in by really good food and $1.50 martinis or bloody marys m-f. Can't beat that!I don't think there are many hotels in New Orleans with outdoor pools--- theirs is on the roof and it is just lovely. What a treat to lounge there in the early afternoon. (However, the air conditioning units can be heard by the pool... so it wasn't perfection--- but quite close.) We loved the Monteleone. We will absolutely stay there next time we are in New Orleans. ',GOOD,
'Not for the business traveler Despite the quaint nature and long tradition of this hotel, it is not for business travelers. I stayed at the Hotel Monteleone as part of a business convention. The room was neat and clean, although during a 4 night stay I did not once get fully stocked amenities. One day, towels provided were ripped and stained. Internet connection in the room is by wire only, and works fine. Wireless in the lobby is spotty at best. The biggest problem is that once you pay for internet access in your room, you do not get access in the hotel's meeting rooms. So while I was there for business, during the meetings I attended I was unable to access the internet. Also, they do not have enough staff at this point. Long waits to get help to check in or at the bell station. I had booked a shuttle to the airport, and the bellman told me to wait in the lobby (since it was raining) and they would come in and call me when it arrived. 20 minutes after the reservation time, I checked with the bellman and he said it never arrived. But when I called the shuttle, they said the shuttle had come and left because I was not there. Staff was particularly unhelpful at that point.So, while this is probably a good hotel for a vacation spot -- it is located a block off Bourbon Street in the French Quarter -- it is not ready for the business traveler. ',POOR,
'Best pool view in NOLA My husband and I stayed at the Monteleone for four nights. Our room was a king room. While well furnished, the room was very small. As I was there on business, I needed to use my laptop and it got very cramped. The hotel provides internet connections in the room at $10.00 per day. Parking is $30-36 per day depending on vehicle size. The location is excellent. The Carousel Bar is very appealing and nice, however the street view was blocked for the entire time of my stay by construction repair equipment. Frankly for me the prettiest spot in the hotel was on the rooftop. The pool is small but adequate, there is a snack service till around 7:00 pm, and plenty of chairs. The view is spectacular. Sunset was a particularly nice time to sit up there. We went up one evening around 10:00 and were unceremoniously ushered out. When they close the pool, they close the whole rooftop. The fitness rooms were very well equipped and nice. The common rooms were attractively furnished and quite nice. The desk staff and doormen were pleasant but not terribly useful when directions or information was sought. Apparently many are new arrivals to the City. The concierges were both helpful.There was a bit of a downside. Housekeeping was not great. We found dark hair on our sheets the first night. The sheets also were very worn and had holes. The second day we found cracker packages and crumbs on our toothbrushes. Yuck! The beds are too soft and not terribly comfortable. Those with rooms below the 7th floor reported a lot of noise audible from the street. ',GOOD,
'wonderful stay I stayed her for a convention Oct.7 - 11th. The hotel is right in the French Quarter with restaraunts, bars, shops, art galleries, and antique shops close to the hotel.Hotel highlights: perfect location, beautiful quaint lobby, carousel bar (center of bar rotates), garden rooftop pool, new fitness center, lavishly appointed bathrooms, historical charm (many writers over the last century have stayed at and wrote about the Monteleone - Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Steven Ambrose, among others). Since it is an old hotel - the rooms are on the small size: you can think of it as European style charm. The furnishings in the rooms are also more antique style versus the modern feel and look of a Marriott/Sheraton chain. Some people may like this others may not.Great seafood and raw bars at Red Fish and Bourbon Street restaurants - all just a block from the hotel.I highly recommend this hotel! ',GOOD,
'I would go back. I stayed here just this past weekend; I loved the hotel and have nothing but positive things to say about it. The location was great for walking to Bourbon street. The staff was very kind and informative about all of our inquires. The beds were heaven and walls seem to be on the thick side-which is a plus. The only thing that was annoying was the plastic room key. We had to call for someone to let us in the rooms on more than one occation, but they were very prompt about coming to let us in. That alone will not deter me from visiting again. ',GOOD,
'I have to go back! I visited New Orleans for work but arrived a couple days ahead to see the city. I had the best time. The hotel is simply beautiful. The staff is the friendliest I鈥檝e ever seen! Very attentive and courteous. The carrousel bar is great...try the nutty Irishman coffee, its great! Didn't get an opportunity to visit the restaurants in the hotel as most of our meals were catered in the meeting rooms. But if the food is as good as what they made for us then you have to try it!The city of New Orleans is just wonderful! We partied all night on Bourbon St. which is walking distance from the hotel. And yes, it is safe. Just use common sense as you would when traveling anywhere. We did the haunted tour and the cemetery tour. It was very informative and shows you all the history in this city. As a travel professional myself, I would recommend this hotel and this city in a heart beat. It's one of those places where you just have to experience it to truly appreciate it. After what this city has been through, it鈥檚 amazing to see how well they are doing and how eager they are to have us as their guests. I will definitely go back...soon! ',GOOD,
'OK but not great We just returned from a 4 night stay at The Monteleone. I found a great deal through Travelzoo of $95/nt for Sat.-$85/nt for Sun.-Wed. and was really looking forward to our stay, especially after reading some of the reviews on this site. Our reservation was for a Superior room; however we were upgraded to a Riverview Salon as this was an anniversary celebration.On our arrival, our room was on the 3rd floor and our Riverview was that of the building next door, literally 5 feet from our window; however being that we had requested a smoking room, we assumed this was the designated floor so not a big issue. The staff had a bottle of champagne waiting for us which we thought a nice touch. The room itself was adequate in terms of size; however one side of the bed was literally almost up against the window, leaving space for only one nightstand on one side. Again, not a huge issue; however it would have been nice if both of us could have had space for our reading material, glasses, etc. So be it, this is an old hotel with rooms in varying shapes and sizes. The bed itself was not comfortable to sleep on - mattress was lumpy and the pillows were tiny.The bathroom was awesome. Glass enclosed shower with terrific water-pressure, and a separate jacuzzi tub, double vanity sinks. The towels were adequate; however not great in terms of size.In terms of my complaints about this hotel:1. Service of the staff is lackluster. Once we had finished our champagne, the bucket and empty bottle remainded in our room for 2 days - when we put it in the hallway, it took another 24 hours for someone to pick it up. Same with our room service tray from dinner one evening - it stayed in the hallway for a day and a half. Our maid removed our bathrobes with the used towels one morning, and a call to housekeeping for new ones was met with a surly reply of, did you hang them on the back of the bathroom door? Another time, our ice bucket was not emptied, so we did it ourselves only to find some hair under the plastic liner - we called to get a new plastic liner, along with some extra in room coffee packets, and the reply on the other end of the line was like we had asked for something out of the ordinary. 2. Face to face service was no better - those darn plastic key cards failed to work on a few occasions and upon asking the front desk staff to redo them, we were met with indifferent attitudes about doing so. At NO time did anyone on the staff smile, say thank you, and/or excuse me during our stay. Doormen are too busy chatting with people (especially women headed out for the evening) to open doors or help hail cabs.3. Do not touch any items in the mini-bar unless you are willing to pay right away as the hotel has a sensory charge system. At those prices anyway, it is better to go to the Walgreens on the next block to buy sodas and munchies.4. Asthetically, the hotel's lobby and public areas are lovely and well maintained. Rooms however may be a different matter. Ours had a nice hole in the wall from someone opening the bathroom door a little too hard - a simple door stopper could have prevented that from happening. Walls are paper thin - so much so that we were treated one night to our neighbors high TV volume while they were watching a pay per view pornographic movie. In all honesty, since Katrina I am certain the hotel may have issues in finding the staff it deserves, especially since many people have never returned and others are reluctant to move there. It is a shame, as NOLA is a great place, and dependant on tourism/convention revenue for a major source of income.Would we stay here again? Probably so for the price we paid; however this is not a 5* hotel in my opinion and the thought of paying top $$ during high season (Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, etc.) would definetely steer our business to another property. ',POOR,
'Great Value - Definitely will return! My mother and I stayed at the Monteleone in late September for 2 nights. I loved this hotel and I am very discriminating. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are decorated with traditional antiques. I was very pleasantly surprised with how small the hotel felt given that it is one of the largest in the Quarter. There were no issues with noise or overcrowding / poor service. We had a deluxe king and I was concerned it was going to be cramped but it was not at all. The furnishing were very tasteful and the bathroom was elegant and of adequate size. The location was prime, the staff and bar were great. We encountered one minor issue when trying to rent a movie in our room but a staff member was sent immediately to fix it and I was very pleased with the time in which they responded. Budget tip - book through the hotel directly for great savings. Also, there is a Walgreens right around the corner for those wanting to avoid the high cost of sodas in the room ($3 a can). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a stay at a 4 star hotel. I was very, very pleased and would definitely go back. Enjoy your stay!! ',GOOD,
'Wondeful Stay!A++ This place is great. It was my new wife and I first time in New Orleans and we did not know what to expect. We flew in late at night and took a cab to the hotel. While driving past some of the other French Quarter hotels, we became nervous of what to expect out of ours. But once we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is beautiful. The lobby was very elegant, and the room was as well. We loved everything about our hotel(location, service, etc). Our friends stayed at the W two streets over for double what we paid and our room was so much nicer. Definitely stay here, you will be happy. ',GOOD,
'Pleasant Visit I just returned from a five night convention stay at the Monteleone, September 5-10. I was a solo traveler in a Deluxe Double with plenty of room. It would have been cramped, if there were more than two persons in the room. The convention food was very good. The a/c in the ballroom and meeting rooms made us unaware of the heat and humidity until we went out at night. The rooftop pool was nice for an early morning swim. The gym is open 24/7. The business center charges $7 to just check your email. The city was free wireless internet service, so bring your laptop. With the exception of the reservation and front desk clerks, the hotel staff was friendly and quick to help. Because of a flight delay, I checked in close to midnight. I had asked for a higher room with non-allergenic bedding - these were options on their website reservation page. I was given a ninth floor floor facing the street with eight down pillows and bed coverings. It was disappointing that the front desk clerks can not read or refuse to honor reservation requests. The housekeeping staff was able to remedy the bedding problem. I did notice, however, that my colleagues who checked in the next day got rooms on higher floors. As we entered or exited the elevator, it was also noticeable that persons of color were assigned the lower floors. Since there were very few others on my floor, I did not hear any neighbors whispering next door. Street noise was only noticeable on Saturday night when the hip hop music was blaring from the street cruisers. Mr. B is located in the same block as the hotel; Cafe Beignet and Brennans were also on Royal about two blocks away. It was a long walk to the French Market Place or Canal Place. And it was verrrry loong down dark streets after a night of drinking at my favorite clubs which were on the other side of the French Quarter. ;) I liked this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic vacation!!!! We stayed at the Hotel Monteleone Aug 26-30 and it was wonderful. The staff was friendly and helpful, room was clean and well equipped. We went to the spa for a massage and Brigette was professional and gave a relaxing treatment. We were extremely happy with our stay!!! ',GOOD,
'Not good, not bad Why I didn't like the place:1) Stained carpets, makes for bad impression on first entrance into the room2) Was promised a high floor with a view, got a back alley with garbage bins lining the alley3) No hot water. I asked to change rooms was told there was nothing else.4) Paper thin walls. I heard my neighbors whispering.5) One day, the maids forgot to leave clean towels.6) New Orelans has FREE internet access for the whole French Quarter provided by Earthlink -- it's a City Service. The Hotel Monteleone charged me $9.99 per day without informing me of this. I felt it was lying by ommission.7) Doormen too busy chatting and talking to open doors.8) Slowest elevators in the world. If you have plans, add 15 minutes to your deadline.9) Hotel guests would put their dirty room service trays outside the door and the trays would sit there for 24 hours. I took photos, but decided not to post them.10) Tiny rooms. ',POOR,
'A step above the rest I have to say that the Hotel Monteleone was top notch, we enjoyed our stay there thoroughly. The staff was very helpful, excluding a few stuffy staff members, I find it funny that a desk clerk could be stuffy. Aside from a few staff members being stuffy, they and the others were very helpful. We loved Annette at front desk, also the bartender at the pool, the regular one not the fill in, he had literally no personality. Most of the staff are very helpful, and went out of their way to accommodate our requests, including a room switch. The location of hotel is perfect, right next to all action, you're not caught in the middle of Bourbon St craziness. Food was to die for, we went several places Deanie's Fresh Seafood, affordable and yummy...ACME oyster House, love this place, get the Charbrioled oysters...killer, Tujuaqes, a great deal set price range from 32-39 dollars a plate, but includes everything 5 courses fine dining, casual dress OK though. Gotta have beniets at Cafe Dumond, and Great Jazz at Reservation hall, and a nice little courtyard at Cafe Beniet on Bourbon St after 6pm jazz, food and drinks. We will highly recommend Hotel Montleone for its beauty, class and location. We'll be back for sure ',GOOD,
'Book Monteleone       french quarter ',GOOD,
'Good FQ option We had a very nice night at the Monteleone. The location is excellent and the room was clean and quiet. We did not have a view but we slept like rocks. I prefer a quiet room over one with a window on the French Quarter street noise. If you call thirty mintues before needing your car it should be there for you. ',GOOD,
'Monteleone is an authentic New Orleans experience My husband and I just returned from a great stay at this hotel for our 20th anniversary. We got to the hotel early and tried to check in but our room was not ready. They secured our bags and we were able to check in about an hour early. The front desk was a bit aloof but I wouldn't hold that against the hotel. We eventually got a Riverview suite on the 15th floor that was amazing. The hotel had a special for the month and the price was over $500.00 less than the normal rate. The suite was clean, the bed was great, and the turn down service a nice touch. We used room service for chocolate covered strawberries that were to die for and champagne. I gave them a delivery time while were out and they were waiting for us upon our return.The pool was nice and relaxing and the bar seemed very friendly.We had a drink in the carousel bar and listened to the piano man, you felt transported to another era.We both used the spa my husband had a full body which he rated as one of the best in his life, and I had reflexology. I was not impressed with my service, it was just a message not true reflexology.This hotel thrives becuase it is old school. The doorman opens the door and greets you. The feeling is of a family. The workers love being there and it shows. They treat you as a person not a number. If you are looking for a chain experience try the Ritz, but if you want to have an amazing New Orleans experience this is your place. We walked the French Quarter every night dined at Cafe Beignet down the street each morning. You felt like you were in a movie when life was different but beautiful. I give this trip and hotel an A. ',GOOD,
'Ok for a short visit Spent 3 nights here recently and that was enough. Our room was very small and dark and needed the light on most of the time - with a view of a brick wall. You had to crane your neck to see the sky! However, the bathroom was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortable. They serve a very good value buffet breakfast with everything you good possibly want.I must mention the Concierge who was a lovely charming lady and helped us to find out way around. The staff on the door were also great and one of them recommended the Orleans Cafe on Decateur which was a good restaurant, as we were disappointed to see that the main one in the hotel was closed for the whole of August!!We loved New Orleans and found the local people to be very friendly and helpful, in particular the taxi driver who took us to the airport. We thoroughly enjoyed the river trip on the Nanchez. We were well located for Bourbon Street but were a but disappointed that we didn't hear jazz coming from every quarter whilst walking in the evenings.We would not hesitate to return to New Orleans and, but would choose the Monteleone again. ',POOR,
'Adequate, Not Extravagant Our first impression of the hotel was not a positive one. We had been assured that morning that an early check-in would be fine; however, upon arrival we were summarily dismissed by the less-than-friendly front desk clerk. Throughout our stay, the front desk ladies were rude and condescending. It was almost as if they were doing us a favor just by showing up--heaven forbid we expected them to do their jobs.That being said, the hotel met our needs otherwise. The rooftop pool was a nice diversion, and the fitness room was excellent (and virtually deserted). The room was clean and acceptable, with the exception of the extremely old mattress which folded around us like a taco when we lay down. If you're looking for a clean and convienent hotel in the French Quarter, this is a good bet. If you're looking for a five star luxury experience...keep looking. ',GOOD,
'Good hotel, never park at their garage!! The hotel was nice, I had no problems with the room. However, when it came to parking, they charge you $30.00 per day extra and I waited for my car about an HOUR when I was leaving. The lady was in charge of parking kept telling us next car would be ours everytime I asked. After 40 minutes of waiting, I went and talked to the hotel attendant. Her exact words were what do you want me do about it? Just because of this experience I would never stay at this hotel again. If you stay at this hotel I would not recommend parking at their garage. You can park one block down for the same price and can get your car right away. ',POOR,
'Great hotel, great location! We stayed at the Monteleone for a quick getaway vacation. They had fanatastic rates for early August (we found the weather to be no warmer than our hometown), and it was recommended to us by a friend. We would definitely stay there again in a heartbeat! It's a close walk to Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, everywhere you'd want to go in the French Quarter and a quick cab ride to anywhere else. You really couldn't ask for a better place in terms of location. The staff was okay, not above average customer service, but the concierge was wonderful and had great suggestions for everything we wanted to do. We were in a Superior level room, and while we initially thought it was a little small it ended up being quite a nice amount of space. Their beds are unbelievably comfortable!! The bathrooms were a good size as well. Well-kept, clean rooms, and nice elegant decor. The rooftop pool and gym were fantastic, a gorgeous little getaway in the heart of the city. Overall, a fabulous hotel in a great location, somewhere we felt very fortunate to be staying as we headed home each night. A few suggestions: check out the hotel's website directly for booking, as that's where we found best rate by far. Take a lot of cash with you, many places (especially food and drink places) don't take credit cards. And stop by K-Paul's Kitchen for the best bread pudding you'll ever have! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Property! I would return here in a heartbeat! I stayed for two nights here as part of a long weekend trip to New Orleans.From the minute I walked in I liked the place. Only downside was being told that the room wasn't ready and I was asked to leave a cell phone number and they would call when it was ready...great idea, except no one ever called. I just hung out in the neighborhood and went back 2 hours later and the room was ready.And what a room! I went for a Vieux Carre suite because the summer rates on them were reasonable. Separate sitting room with a powder room, lots of closet space, large bathroom with a jetted tub and separate glass shower...very nice! I had a corner suite on the 15th floor with windows overlooking the river and the quarter as well as a bit of downtown.Carousel Bar was unique and fun. Breakfast at Le Cafe was just ok, it was fairly basic considering the rest of the property. A Sunday breakfast buffet in a big hotel HAS to have a cook making omelettes, not just scrambled eggs in a vat! I just went to the pool for a look see. Nice space, on the roof. But absolutely packed with lots of kids and no open loungers. About what I'd expect on a Saturday afternoon in August, but it would have been nice to maybe relax with a drink or a book for an hour or two up there if it hadn't been a mob scene.My 5th trip to New Orleans, my 3rd post-Katrina. The only downside is I'm spoiled now by the Monteleone and I really can't afford during busier periods in the year! ',GOOD,
'Absolutely gorgeous! We stayed at the Hotel Monteleone for a quick weekend trip (8/3/07 - 8/5/07), and were completely amazed at the great experience we had at the hotel. The hotel is gorgeous, and it's only one block away from Bourbon Street. We felt extremely safe at night. The room was comfortable and clean. Also, there is a great pool on the roofdeck which was an added plus after spending a hot day out on the town. The concierge also suggested two tours for us - the cemetary/voodoo tour and Cajun Encounters. Both were very informative and fun, although the cemetary/voodoo tour was really hot due to the glaring August sun. New Orleans is a wonderful town with great food, bars, and especially people. What they need now more than anything is more tourists to contribute money to their economy. We cannot wait to come back to the Hotel Monteleone again! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful stay at Hotel Monteleone! For our third visit to the French Quarter (and our first since Katrina) we decided to stay at Hotel Monteleone. Our last stay saw us at the LePavillon. We would have stayed there again, but we were unsure about having to walk so many blocks so often. We had heard that security after dark was not as good as it used to be; this turned out to be false. As it was, Hotel Monteleone was every bit as nice as the LePavillon, and smack dab in the center of all Veux Carre! We experienced zero security issues.Our drive in, and down I-10, showed us just a hint of the damage from Katrina. Once we exited onto Orleans Avenue, there was no sign of the hurricane. Miraculously, and even though the danged FQ street signs are on the wrong side for easy viewing, we drove right into the Montelone parking garage. We liked the fact there was a parking facility, even though it cost us $27/day. Once secured, we grabbed our luggage (if they ask if you need help getting to your room, say yes) and headed for the Desk. We booked our rooms straight on Hotel Monteleon website, for $99.00/109.00 a night (we arrived on Thursday). Check-in was easy, and the clerk was very polite. The Concierge is right up front, too, if you need anything. The lobby was grand to say the least. The room was small but immaculate. The furnishing were a tad cramped in our standard king room. You had to practically slide sideways to get between the bed and TV/entertainment system! Still, other than for sleep, who comes to New Orleans to lay around a hotel room;-)? The view of the air conditioning system out the window was even nice. Now, back to the cleanliness. You could eat your soup right out of the bathroom sink if you wanted to. Nice. Not so much as a hair; a CSI team would be left clueless. Lots of towels and amenities. The only dust we saw was around the dry/wet bar under the TV. And, as others have eluded, you don't dare touch any of the cookies and alcoholic beverages located there. If you so much as look at it wrong, you'll find a $4.39 cent charge on your bill. Infrared sensors detect if an item is picked up. No doubt this is why it was dusty! Even the wait staff steers clear! Oh, and the refrigerator didn't cool anyway...Did I mention Hotel Monteleone is right where all the action is? It was a short five or so minute walk over to Decatur Street and Crescent City Brewery, Cafe Du Monde, or the Aquarium. Bourbon Street was just a few over. We experienced very few troubles out on the street, save for the one guy who we kept running into who wanted to talk to me about my choice of footwear... There is a Walgreen's half a block away, as well as a Cafe Beignet; Acme Oyster House is a block over, too. We visited the rooftop pool twice during our stay. It closes at about ten I think, but the bar much earlier. This was a shame. The pool was pretty clean, but had a lot of leaf matter in the water from all the surrounding plants. No biggie. We enjoyed the night up top, but on Friday evening it was overrun by teens who could not comprehend the meaning of NO DIVING. And I'll make it the rest of my life without hearing the phrase Marco Polo ever again. The pool lacked a sauna, though there may have been one inside someplace (ten extra points to the Le Pavillon in this regard). Everyone we came into contact with at the Monteleon was extremely friendly and spoke fluent English. Our room was always clean and straight very early in the day. The Bell staff was attentive and fast! When you call for luggage help, expect a knock as you put the phone down. We didn't have to ask for much special stuff as it was all there to begin with. We ate breakfast one morning at the Le Cafe. The food was fine and the cost on par with what you'd expect to pay. The servings were filling and, once again, the staff was very friendly. It was close and quick. We did not visit the famous rotating bar, but it was always lively and filled with patrons. A simple phone call and our bags were down in the parking garage. It was a short 25 minute wait for our vehicle (make sure you call ahead before you leave your room). The vehicle was as we had left it. My advice: leave the car there and WALK. For the Thursday to Sunday stay, we spent $460. This included parking and some small fees. All in all, highly recommended, and we'll likely return. ',GOOD,
'You don't get to stay at hotels like this very often. This was my second visit and will return again in October. I can't imagine you would be disappointed with your stay at this beautiful hotel. The location is excellent. I did encounter one unpleasant gal at the front desk. The first day I stopped with a question she had a French accent, and was not very helpful about the safe not working in the room. The second day the accent disappeared and she told me my bus tranportation to the airport inquiry was not an option, two minutes later the doorman told me exactly how to go about it. The hotel and all the rest of the staff are too wonderful to let this one person keep me away, she'll probably be gone by then, the standards are too high for an employee like that. ',GOOD,
'Know Before You Go The Good: The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. Our room was small, but luxuriously decorated and the bed was comfortable. Great bath products. The Carousel Bar was interesting and fun, nice piano singer. There is a room safe. Complimentary coffee setup in room.The Bad: Be aware, the minibar has a sensor. It charges you if a product is lifted up for more than a set amount of time (it was seconds, not minutes). On top of the minibar product fee, there is a TEN DOLLAR restocking fee! Be aware. When we were checking in, a man was complaining at the desk that he was charged for several items that fell over when he was getting a water out. The clerk was giving him a hard time that was not resolved by the time our check in was done. Parking was unsatisfactory. Each day, it took over half an hour to get our car brought out from on-site parking. The woman in charge of taking the parking tickets had an attitude. While the hotel itself is thankfully quiet, the walls are thin. We were awakened at 3 and 4 in the morning by rowdy people returning. Another time, we were awakened at 7 AM by a hearty talking bellman delivering a cart across the hall. I guess no one cares that most people are sleeping at 7 AM in the Quarter after being awakened at 3 and 4. Bring ear plugs. ',GOOD,
'A Wonderful Hotel My wife and I just returned from our 25th wedding anniversary celebration. The Hotel Monteleone was wonderful. It's great a place to stay and enjoys a wonderful location in the Quarter. We met so many nice people, ate so many great meals and heard so much fantastic music that it made for a great 4-day weekend. We had such a great time we're planning our return. New Orleans matters - help support it by visiting. ',GOOD,
'Pros and Cons My family and I go to NO once or twice a year and having always heard how wonderful Hotel Monteleone was and having found a great rate we decided to see for ourselves. The best way to share our experience is to divide it into pros and cons. Pros are as follows: 1. A great consignier!! 2. Impressive lobby with lots of glitz 3. Very nice doormen, garage attendants, maids, etc. 4. Comfortable beds, nicely furnished room. Now for the Cons. 1. The front desk checked in others before us. We were in line. 2. The room smelled musty. 3. The mini fridge is a one door bandit!! It is stocked with candies and drinks and has a very small strip-sign inside saying if you remove the item from the fridge you will be charged. Of course I picked up a can to see what it was and that's when I saw the sign. I immediately replaced the can of candies on the shelf, but was charged on check out even though I didn't open the can or eat the candy. They should put the label on the outside of the fridge so that it can be seen, but then unsuspecting visitors might not check out the fridge and get ripped off. 4. This is picky, but no dirty clothes bag provided. Our visit was a mixed bag. Some good, some not so good. If I were to go back to the Hotel Monteleone, I would be sure to NOT touch the fridge and take some air freshner. ',POOR,
'Monteleone was Perfection The Hotel Monteleone is gorgeous. We had a room facing the city. Not such a great view during the day because it is of the roof tops but if you really look you can pick out different landmarks like the cemeteries. At night it was gorgeous with lights as far as you could see. We had two double beds and plenty of room. The room was immaculate and the beds are extremely comfortable although the pillows left a lot to be desired. Even though we hung our towels up everyday to conserve on energy they always replaced them with clean ones everyday. There is a coffee pot in the room but I preferred to go to the lobby in the gift shop where you could get coffee/tea for $2.50. The in-room safe worked perfectly and they do have the minibar. I would have preferred no minibar to have more drawer space. The rooms are decorated beautifully. The hotel roof pool is on the small size and heated but is a beautifully landscaped. We did eat breakfast one day in the hotel caf茅 but was not impressed at all because we were spoiled by the bacon at Caf茅 Beignet. The doormen are a wonderful, helpful addition that have the most marvelous personalities and smiles. Even the young lady in the gift shop was so courteous and polite by always asking how my visit was going and if everything was acceptable. NOLA has the nicest and most respectful people in the entire USA. I'm not kidding everyone in the US should visit NOLA and take home a lesson in hospitality and manners. The city is spotless and beautiful just visit you will not be dissappointed in the sites, food or people. ',GOOD,
'Definitely the place to stay Absolutely stay at the Hotel Monteleone - first class all the way. I would write more, but I would only continue to gush! ',GOOD,
'Best hotel in the Quarter The hotel was wonderful. I have stayed at many other hotels in the Quarter and this is the best. The rooftop pool was a great joy. You can take an audiotour of the hotel to discover the history (and there is lots). We arrived at about 11:00 am and were able to check in right away. The rooms were very clean. The bar was a blast. This was a great stay. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful ambiance LOCATIONThe location is ideal for walking to everything you want to see in New Orleans. Boubon Street for partyers, stripclub visitors, and drinkers is only one block away, but the hotel is in a quiet area on Royal St. We were put off by the vomit/sewerage odors of Bourbon St., so we opted for the quieter, artsy side of the French Quarter. Royal St. was really nice and is lined with mostly galleries, cafes and shops. Across from the hotel is a Walgreens drug store, a convenience store and a couple of restaurants. It is about 5 long blocks (10-15 minute walk) to Harrah's casino, Shops on Canal and Riverwalk mall area, as well as 7-8 small blocks to Cafe Du Monde and the Jackson Square area of the French Quarter.ROOMThe room is adequately sized, very clean and nicely appointed if you like the old world charm of New Orleans. It has a grand, antique feel to the place, signifying luxury and European elegance. The halls are slightly dimly lit with red carpets that kind of creeped me out because it reminded me of the Shining, but luckily we didn't see anything supernatural :-)... the hotel is rumored to be haunted! The shower pressure was excellent and the tub and toilet area were sparkling clean, and I'm super picky! The only complaint that can probably only be mine is that the beds were supersoft and moved very easily (not very stable), but I have always liked a more solid and firmer bed for my bad back. Also, maybe another minor detail is that they didn't have a remote control but a sort of attached remote/combination game controller device for the TV.SERVICEThe front desk is pleasant, and the people friendly and very European. I think all the personnel were from Europe, so a lot of languages were spoken, great for the foreign traveler not knowing much English! The concierge lady was from Sweden, so she spoke many languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Swedish and English. We did not have the opportunity to call room service or go into the bars/restaurants, but the Carousel Bar looked nice and crowded, and there's supposed to be a rooftop bar that is pleasant. Breakfast was really good, but not free and kind of pricey. We don't have anything to complain about service at all. ',GOOD,
'Elegant Hotel The Hotel Monteleone has a grand and sophisticated atmosphere. It's reputation alone is worth a stay or at least a visit. The lobby has marble throughout and elegant French d茅cor. My room was on the second floor, smack dab in the middle of the hotel's front entrance. It had a great view of the French Quarter, high ceilings, and was well-furnished. The bathrooms could use some updating: the shower tiles were dated and the sink leaked. We stayed there on New Year's Eve, so the service was rushed and the public spaces were hectic. Some features of the place showed wear, but other than that a great choice if you want a centrally located and reliable hotel. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Monteleone I've been to New Orleans quite a few times, but this was my first stay at the Monteleone. It is a beautiful, elegant hotel, and might be my favorite hotel anyplace.You will not go wrong staying at the Monteleone. ',GOOD,
'Old South, still suffering from Katrina My husband had meeting at this hotel last week. The rooms are smaller than most newer hotels. We understand the mgmt is still housing some of its staff in order to stay open since Katrina. New Orleans definitely needs everyone's business to rebuild. Everything was clean, flowers in lobby beautiful. Problem with locks is that the keys demagnetize when in the same pocket as credit cards or cell phones. Had to return to front desk twice to get re magnetized. Reception food was lovely, nicely done in their top floor room. Disappointed at the pool...Advertised as roof top pool...was more like a wading pool, not long enough to be a lap pool. Exercise room had lots of new equipment.Was given good direction to coffee shop 2 blocks down the street. Hotel book says their restaurant opened at 6 for breakfast, but doesn't open untll 6:30, Had to wait til we got to airport to get breakfast. ',GOOD,
'Service, Dependability  I stayed here for a very happy 5 days with my teenage son. The hotel's location in the French Quarter is ideal (central, safe and very Nawlins), our room was very comfortable and clean, and we enjoyed the rooftop pool and bar. The food in the restaurants (and room service) was wonderful. Above all else, though, it was the people who work at the Monteleone that made this experience so exceptional. EVERYONE we met was friendly, helpful and very professional. ',GOOD,
'A Great Night at the Monteleon Having not been to New Orleans since Katrina I was more than just a bit anxious. I did not know what sort of condition we were going to find the city in. We were heading down to check out Tulane University for my daughter. After driving around about I was very happy to see that the French Quarter and the Garden district were just fine.We got the special Tulane rate of $149. From the moment of arrival the staff was very attentive. The door man, the front desk clerk and everyone else we encountered at the hotel were all very polite and happy to help. We stayed on the 15th floor with a room overlooking the Quarter. It was a nice size room with two very comfortable double beds. The rooms were in very good shape. I was a little nervous about staying there because I had seen on the hotels website that there was paranormal activity that went on there. No ghosts showed up to visit us though!The carousel bar downstairs is beautiful. Although that night the carousel was not working. It still seems very fun to sit on a chair under the carousel and have a cocktail. I was with my 17 year old daughter so we stayed in our room watching tv instead.We had a delicous lunch at Mothers, dinner at Acme Oyster Bar, and dessert at Arnauds. Three great experiences! At Arnauds we had the bananas foster (a must have), praline crepes (another must have) and the bread pudding (it was good, not great). The service was amazing. I will deffinelty return to all three places on my next trip.Although it was a quick trip it was wonderful and I would go back to the Monteleone! ',GOOD,
'We loved the Monteleone!!!! I can't say enough good things about New Orleans and the Hotel Monteleone. The hotel was beautiful. Our room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning worked well. The floor we stayed on was very quiet. We stayed during Mardi Gras, so it was busy, but we still received a lot of attention from the staff. We loved seeing the Carousel Bar. We would certainly stay there again. New Orleans was such an amazing place. The people were so kind and happy to have visitors from other states there. The sights were great. The French Quarter was so much fun. We went on a small tour of the one of the cemeteries and learned so much. We also went over to Algiers and went to Mardi Gras World. It gave us such an appreciation of the work that is put into the floats. We can't wait to go back! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful stay at the Monteleone The Hotel Monteleone has a lot going for it. From location to history this is a great place to stay. We loved the location. Close enough to Bourbon St, but seems to be in another world when you want some peace and quiet. We found the quiet to a welcome change after a night on Bourbon. Staff here for the most part was top notch. The Concierge was great and most of the other staff as well. There was one front desk clerk who seemed to have a bit of attitude, but not enough to ruin a nice stay. We had a Riverview Suite and could not have been happier. We had plenty of room and found the rooms to be comfortable, clean and well maintained. We also like having the half bath off of the parlor made getting ready a snap not having to worry about on of the baths being occupied. The baths here are very nice, lots of marble and nice touches. As others have stated, the toilets are a bit loud when flushed but not enough to take away from the stay. The walk in shower in our room was great, and along with the Jacuzzi tub, you couldn鈥檛 ask for more. My only complaint about the room was the bed. I鈥檝e read other reviews here and folks seem to love the bed. We did not. I found it to be too soft and hate the fact that even though the linens were top of the line, they are still using a flat instead of fitted sheet for the mattress. We were sorry to see the Carousel Bar was closed during our stay. It opened the day we left. We didn鈥檛 try any of the restaurants located in the hotel. Had many great meals at other New Orleans restaurants and next time will try out the restaurants in the Monteleone. We did try out Spa Aria and were very happy with the services and staff there. A great stay, great location and a great city. We鈥檒l be back! ',GOOD,
'French Quarter Elegance The Monteleone is a great hotel. Everything about my recent stay there was terrific; service, cleanliness, location, luxury, affordability were all top-notch.The icing on the cake is the incredible roof-top pool. I can't wait to go back. ',GOOD,
'A great stay at Hotel Monteleone My son and I stayed at Hotel Monteleone for one night after our cruise out of New Orleans. We chose the hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and its great location and we were not disappointed. The lobby is lovely with its chandeliers and large grandfather's clock. We came straight from our ship and got to the hotel around 10:30am and we were able to get our room right away which was nice. The room was clean, nicely decorated with beautiful fabric on the beds and curtains. The bathroom isn't huge, but it was very nice with granite countertops. The toilet is loud as another review mentioned, but no big deal. The beds were very comfy and the sheets were nice and soft. After getting settled we got a map and directions to Cafe Du Monde from the concierge and we were off. The street the Hotel is on is nice, peaceful compared to the nearby Bourbon street. We ended up having a tasty meal at the Gumbo Shop. When we walked in at 11:30 we were seated right away, but by the time we left there was a line. After sightseeing for a few hours we went back to the hotel and headed up to the rooftop pool which was lovely. There are lots of potted flowers and plants and it was a great place to relax after all that walking. My son swam for over an hour and I had a glass of wine from the little bar up there and read my book and was happy as can be. We had to get up really early the next morning for our flight and Igot my wake up call as asked and the front desk called a taxi for us and we were off. My only disappointment-the Carousel bar was closed for remodeling and I had wanted to see that-darn. We really enjoyed our short stay in New Orleans and I would definetely stay at this hotel again.

'Perfect Location        View from top floor ',GOOD,
'What a Great Hotel in a Great City We went down to NOLA to see how it was recovering...and just as we expected, the people of NO are doing fine...there are lots of problems to deal with, but the Quarter, the downtown and the Garden district suffered very little damage. All of the restaurants are open, the hotels are open (the music scene is still a little thin)...all we need is more tourists. The central location of the hotel is what brought us here. We've stayed at other hotels in the Quarter, usually smaller old hotels, but none can touch the character and quality of the Monteleone. We were fortunate to be there for the opening parade of Madi Gras (Krewe de Vieux), and we made the most of our time in town, with plenty of Oyster PBs from Acme Oyster  Seafood House(but stay away from the Acme Oyster House in the Airport). The best thing about the Monteleone is the Concierge service. We were served by two different concierge's, and both of them were very helpful (booking reservations, providing information, etc). Whatever you do, bring money and spend it in NO...that way the people of NO will rebuild the city in the way they want, not as dictated by some absentee government official. ',GOOD,
'Our 12th Anniversary This was a terrifc spot in the french quarter. Just a block off of Bourbon, so if you wanted to do some shopping, walk to the casino or the river, it was right there for you to do and also could enjoy some quiet time away from the nightlife. The rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. The staff was pleasant, extremely helpful and always gave us the right places to go to. Check out the Carousel Bar, the roof top pool (very nice) and the workout room has just enough to keep you in your routine (nice views of the Mississippi). Try Spa Aria, we got mini facials and it was worth every minute as well so relaxing and a nice atmosphere. We didn't eat in the restaurants, but the menus always looked appetizing. Make sure you check out Cafe du Monde, Acme, Red Fish, the antique stores, the casino and the market as well Two Sisters for their brunch, well worth it. Try the local beer, Abita. And definitely hit a few of the jazz bars that are still playing jazz. Make sure you ask for a room on a higher floor with a view, you can watch the cruise ships and barges come in and out all day/night.New Orleans, a great place to visit, unwind and have too much fun. Stay at the Monteleone, you won't be disappointed. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel, Excellent Location I stayed at the Hotel Monteleone for 1 evening in early December 2006. All appears fine, post-Katrina. The room was excellent. Front desk staff was cordial. I have stayed here pre-Katrina and would definitely stay here again. You can't beat the location on Royal Street. Look on the hotel's website; the hotel often runs great rates that are worthwhile for a luxury hotel. ',GOOD,
'Great French Quarter Hotel Very convenient location, easy walking to distance to everything, we even walked to the restaurant August. Located among lovely galleries and antique shops. Lobby is beautiful. Staff is helpful and accommodating. Carosel style bar is fun, stop by for a drink. Rooms are small but elegant. Skip breakfast in the restaurant- it is bad. Turn right out of hotel doors to walk to a nearby coffee shop for a quick breakfast. We will stay at the Monteleone again, it was gracious and lovely with a great location. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful hotel but get your confirmation details in writing My husband and I booked two rooms. The first room we needed for earlier in the week and the second room was for the Mardi Gras weekend only. Our room was perfect and everything went smoothly. However, when we checked into the second room that was to be used by our adult children, we were not given the room we had confirmed. We requested a room with 2 double beds for 4 people and it was confirmed on the phone and then again in person whenever we checked into our room. However, upon check-in to the second room, we received a room with a KING bed booked for only ONE person. We were told in rather a rude way that is what you booked so you will have to pay $25 extra per person for an armband. No matter how much I tried to reason with this lady she just stared at me and refused to believe me--basically her attitude was that we were lying and they had not made a mistake. Over the years, we have spent thousands of dollars at this hotel and spent around $6000 plus this trip and I was highly insulted with her attitude. I was so upset that I failed to get her name but it did teach me a lesson--get your confirmation with room details in writing. Ask for a fax or e-mail containing the details so you will have proof. Besides all the problems with this one thing, the Monteleone is a wonderful hotel in a great location. ',GOOD,
'New Orleans is still awesome I've been going to New Orleans for over 10 years. And yes Hurricane Katrina has done some damage. But the French Quarter is always under construction so it's hard to know what's related to the hurricane and what's just finally fallen apart. But the music, the art, the food, and the drinks are all still hopping, and they need and want our support. Don't let the media hype get you down. As long as you're not dealing or buying drugs, stay in areas you know are safe, and keep your wits about you like any savvy tourist, you'll be fine. I've never had a problem or even felt uncomfortable. I really liked the Hotel Monteleone. I've stayed at several different places, but never the same place twice. I would go back to the Hotel Monteleone. Okay, the property is not one of the charming little hotels in the French Quarter (e.g., Cornstalk), but here's all the things it had that those hotels often lack: a good sized room, a great bed, a great shower, and most importantly, quiet. When I stay in New Orleans, I want function in my lodging mostly because if I'm going to lounge somewhere it's going to be in the neighborhood coffee house, restaurant, or bar, NOT in my room. I was there over Mardi Gras season and it was nice to have a safe haven away from the madness. It also has the Carousel Bar, which rotates, but it breaks down if there's too many people. Such is New Orleans. One booking tip- the hotel will match internet rates. So I found a better rate on a travel service (e.g., Expedia or something like that), but booked directly with the hotel at the same rate.If you want food tips: muffaletta at Central Grocery or Johnny's Po'boys; beignets and cafe au lait at Cafe du Monde; and for an upscale meal, I've never had a better meal that the ones I've had at NOLA, Emeril's restaurant in the quarter (try the hickory smoked duck, it's awesome). Tons of great places for music too, but some of my latest favorites: Fritzell's, Sean Kelly's, and One-Eyed Jacks. Finally, we had a great cooking class (Lunch and Learn) at Savvy Gourmet on Magazine; very fun and very tasty. The spirit of New Orleans is alive and well. I think the poster we bought said it all, We will rebuild New Orleans-- after Mardi Gras! ',GOOD,
'Classy Grand Dame Fabulous grand old hotel that has been renovated recently. Room was great and had a european flare, bathroom was alittle small, but beautifully renovated. Hotel staff were exceptionally accommodating. Hotel location was perfect, one block from Bourbon Street and just blocks from some of the best restaurants on earth. Hotel Monteleone is the only place to stay! ',GOOD,
'Pricey but beautiful hotel The Monteleone is at a great location 1 block from Bourbon street. The hotel is very clean and although we did not have a great view, the bed was comfortable and the room was very elegant. I really loved the soap and shampoo...it has a nice smell and the shampoo doesn't dry out your hair like at other hotels. I would definitely stay here again! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful old world hotel Booked a room at the Monteleone so that we could enjoy the carnival festivities in the French Quarter. After receiving an e-mail confirmation, I replied via e-mail to the reservation agent that I was concerned about noise in the Quarter and requested a room that was on one of the upper floors of the property. The agent replied that every attempt would be made to comply with our request. We check in about 3:30 P.M. and were quite pleased to find that our room was located on the 14th floor of the building and at the end of the hallway, so it was wonderfully quiet. The hotel is immaculately maintained with fresh flowers and plants throughout. The hotel is a block from Bourbon St. but a world away. The rooftop heated pool and surrounding areas offer sweeping views. We found a place to park our car on the street and left it there all weekend to save on the $30 per night parking fee. There are many wonderful hotels in New Orleans, but the Monteleone tops my list for location, New Orleans character and charm, cleanliness, comfort, and great service. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Stay in New Orleans Fist time in New Orleans since Katrina. On business attending attending a conference at the Convention Center. Convention Center has been totally redone. The hotel staff were great. Upgraded me upon my arrival to a larger room. I was booked in the least expensive room. Room was clean, good size and had everything you would need. Excellent location for Bourbon Street and the Quarter. On my recommendation, take the Airport Shuttle, parking is quite expensive. Watch the cabbies around town. I got over charged by one that did not use the meter. Set rates from and to the airport. Staff were great. I would recommend this hotel to business travelers. ',GOOD,
'Superb hotel Superb hotel, great location, friendly staff. Couldn't fault it. ',GOOD,
'Picky guests impressed by this hotel! i love this website, and thought it was about time to contribute. my wife  i just stayed three nights at the monteleone, and were happy with our experience. the rate from travelocity was amazing (and not found on other search engines), and the hotel's facilities excellent value. the bedroom was spacious though not huge, very tastefully decorated, and the bed was most comfortable (i love westin beds too, but this was perfectly fine). negative issues were few: the room had not been valeted as well as it should have been - we found a bracelet on the bedroom floor, and some coins in the bathroom. there was no clock/radio in the room. the view from the window was simply the back of another building - but i didn't expect anything better from a third floor room. the hotel shop closed early, with no sign posted. pluses, though, included excellent staff, especially the feisty but very competent eva (concierge), and the doormen, one of whom got me a private car to the airport when there were none to be had on the street. the hunt grill was very good indeed - we dined there late one night, and would say it could stand comparison with the restaurants we tried in the french quarter. terrific, savvy wait staff in the grill, too. we didn't use the rooftop pool, though it looked lovely, and the view from up there was great. this was our first visit to new orleans, and our fond memories are based upon the monteleone. this is a terrific hotel, and not at all like the more anonymous chain hotels nearby. its location is superb, near to bourbon street, but far enough away to escape the craziness, and situated on royal street, which is a pleasure to stroll down. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel depending on which room you get This is a classic New Orleans hotel. the location is GREAT. I had the bad luck of getting room right across from the spa and right next to the big banquet hall... room 225? 255? I can't remember. Just make sure you do not get this room. The weekend i was there, a big party was going on in the banquet hall and was very noisy. The room literally shares a wall with the banquet room so it's like you are at the party. I believe all the party has to end by Midnight so it's not too late but if you wanted to catch some sleep before going out... it's not possible. Also in the morning you get awaken by the people going to the spa. I'mnot much of a partier (was there for a wedding) so when i tried to sleep around 1am, it was nearly impossible because of the noise from the street. My friends who got room on the top floors(hotel goes up to 15 floors), slept fine so make sure you get room on the upper floors. Aside from that, i thought the hotel was very nice. ',GOOD,
'Absolutely Fantastic - No Complaints The hotel is so very nice! It's just a couple blocks from Canal, from the Quarter, from Jackson Square, and right on Royal - some of the best antique shopping I do. The staff was fantastic, the bar was great - thank you to Betty - the best waitress ever - in the Carousel Bar in the lobby. I have absolutely no complaints about this hotel - one of the last family-owned hotels in America. The beds are amazingly soft yet supportive, down pillows, marble bathrooms, great amenities. My filet mignon with burgundy wine sauce was fabulous and it was room service! The grilled chicken club sandwich in Le Cafe (?) the hotel casual restaurant was definitely the best I'd ever had, and I eat club sandwiches everywhere I go. People - New Orleans (in the tourist areas) is back - and they want you to come back and support their economy. The best restaurants, hotels, Harrah's casino, and of course Bourbon Street are all waiting for you. It's such a fantastic place to visit. Everyone was so kind and thankful to have everyone in town for the Saints game, New Year's Eve and the Allstate Bowl on 1/3/07. Please go back if you've been before and you're wondering what it's like right now. If you've never been, NOLA will not disappoint you. I'll be back as soon as I can! And stay at the Monteleone! I was in room 852, at the end of a quiet hall, in a smaller room (I asked for a quiet room and didn't care about the size) and it was still absolutely lovely. Go on, go for it, you won't regret your stay at the Monteleone or eating, shopping and perhaps drinking your way through NOLA! P.S. I traveled by myself and did not, for even one moment, feel threatened in any way. Everyone went out of their way to make you feel welcome and to assure your return. I live in Houston, so I know better than to wander around by myself in the evenings anyway. I have been to NOLA 4 times before this weekend and really couldn't see any difference in the Quarter, Jackson Square, etc. If you're on the fence about going, I would say do it - it's such a great city. And check out the antique shops on Magazine St (2000 block or so), about a $7 cab fare each way. There are some less expensive shops there, in addition to dress shops, lingerie shops, electic/funky shops too (like Winky's and Up, the store above upstairs in Winky's. ',GOOD,
'Worst beds in the world While the folks working at the Monteleone are helpful... they can't overcome the horrible mattress situation they have going on here. Maybe I've stayed in too many Westins and J. W. Marriotts but this qualifies as the worst sleeping experience I have ever come across. Please Monteleone consider replacing these Sponge Bob facilities you call beds. Also parking is over priced. Drive a couple of blocks to Canal Place shoppes and park there for $10 less a night. On the bright side the bathrooms are really spacious. ',POOR,
'Wonderful       Royal Street on a foggy Saturday morning. ',GOOD,
'Fabulous, as usual Me, wife and 3 kids stayed at Monteleone for a night 11/21/06. The Hotel was not damaged by Katrina but you can tell that the City has taken a tourist hit. There were far fewer people in the Hotel and in the city than in past visits. This is just another GREAT reason to visit this hotel. The Monteleone apparently took the opportunity to upgrade its rooms just after the storm. The beds were fantastic! All of the sheets are of high quality and the pillows rival any hotel. The carousel bar was busy every night and had a great clientele. The drinks are priced reasonable and stiff! We did not eat at any of the Hotel restaurants. My 9 year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the audio tour of the hotel. This is a free service provided by the Monteleone. I am not a history buff but the tour is VERY impressive. We did it because it spotlights ghost sightings in the Hotel....partuicularly on the 14th floor....Which is where we stayed. Fortunately...we did not see a ghost! We loved this hotel! New Orleans will make it back bigger and better. In fact the Quarter seemed cleaner than in years past . The restaurants were a lot less crowded but the service and great tasting food was still there! This Hotel is centrally loctaed and perfect for Bar hopping or just hanging out!! We will definitely stay there again for the Sugar Bowl. ',GOOD,
'The fabulous Monteleone the monteleone is absolutely wonderful in every way. staying here really made our nola visit more memorable. if you can stay here, do so. you will not regret it. the location is perfect. we could walk to many points of interest, restaurants and shopping. boubon street is a few minutes walk.the rooms are lovely and the lobby and public areas are just beautiful. if you have time, take the audio tour of the hotel; it's free and so interesting. much history here. and ghosts too. the entire staff was helpful and was always looking to be of assistance.the concierge in the lobby booked us a tour with celebration tours, which i highly recommend. (the owner, ozzie, drove us around and was so gracious and informative.) the concierge also made us dinner reservations and gave us needed brochures and maps. she also cautioned us about areas to avoid. we had no problems. parking is available in the garage and the hotel is easily accessed from major highways.we enjoyed drinks in the carousel bar and our breakfast in the cafe. we ate most meals out. k pauls restaurant was marvelous and right down the street.we visited the devastated areas on the tour but if you are going tonola only for touring purposes, everything else is open and operating and in good condition. the tour of the hurricane affected areas is really worthwhile and eye-opening. they have a long way to go and certainly can use our tourist dollars. ',GOOD,
'Perfect hotel!!!! Will return!!!       Our room ',GOOD,
'Monteleone above average but still has some issues I stayed here over four nights while doing a photo shoot in the city. The rooms were clean and comfortable and a welcome respite for the most part. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Except for the time I waited an hour and a half for silverware from room service without explanation. The big drawback to the hotel is the 9.95 per day internet fee. Most hotels in the area have free wireless at this point. I went to a wonderful espresso cafe on Decatur with free wireless to take care of business. ',GOOD,
'Nothing wrong with it. We arrived an hour before check in and were prepared for a wait.We went to the Carosel Bar to have Bloody Marys and watch the games that were on.The front desk were to call our cell phone when the room was ready.Our phone never rang so we checked with the desk and they changed a well published check in time to 2 hours later.That was really our only frustration.We were in the city for the Saints Monday Night Football Party over the Falcons(GO SAINTS)The hotel is so convient to eveything including the Superdome where the walk was fine.We have stayed here many times since we sold our home uptown and find it to be all you really need.We even had spa treatments at SPA ARIA this time and the staff were so nice and the treatments were great.For the money the hotel is nice.Some of the rooms are a little small and bathrooms are cramped,but what are you here for?To hang out in a hotel room.Get Real its New Orleans. ',GOOD,
'Highly recommended! We were in town for Mardi Gras, and got to spend a week in our favorite New Orleans hotel, the Monteleone. The Hotel's History, attentive staff, and convienient French Quarter location make the Monteleone a perfect choice. Our room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were very friendly, in spite of the chaotic Mardi Gras atmosphere. Dont forget to check out their legendary revolving bar in the Carousel Lounge! We're looking forward to staying here again next Mardi Gras! ',GOOD,
'Very pleasant stay We stayed here whilst in town for a conference, after visiting a number of hotels in New Orleans during our research for the event.Our stay in the Monteleone was excellent, it is ideally located, just far enough away from Bourbon St. for the noise not to carry. The room was comfortable, clean and well serviced, although I couldn't make the ethernet network work. The bathroom was excellent. The front desk staff were always helpful, the only downside to the whole visit was that the rotating bar got a bit confusing after a few drinks!! ',GOOD,
'2nd stay at the Monteleone This was our second stay at the Monteleone. We stayed there many yrs ago before they had redone the interior completely. At that time, it was very pleasant; they have now updated the rooms and it was very nice, but not quite as charming as before. While there is not as much staff as there used to be prior to the hurricane (doorman not always present and no porters), my major complaint was that the parking lot was full when we arrived. We were directed to park in the public parking garage adjacent to the Holiday Inn and it cost us big $$$, and was inconvenient to have to move our luggage from a block away with 2 children in tow. Other than that we had a very nice stay with a great rate (under $100/night). Wonderful location and great history. ',GOOD,
'Great but beware of unexperienced attendant... I enjoyed my stay at the Monteleone. It's in walking distance to Bourbon St. The parking is $27 a day. Room  bathrooms were clean. My room wasn't big or small. Room service breaskfast was good  reasonably priced. Be attentive at check-in. The attendant made errors charging an extra $75 that I'm having to dispute with my card company. So many attempts at the hotel I gave up. I would stay here again. Shish happens. ',GOOD,
'Perfect stay- we will be back Older historic hotels are so intriguing but can be hit or miss. The Monteleone is a BIG hit. What a fabulous, clean, charming place. We only stayed one night but the bed was so comfy and the shower was terrific. We enjoyed sitting by the lovely pool having a drink and relaxing before heading out to the Saturday night madness. The staff was reserved but helpful and friendly when asked a question. I can't imagine that we will stay anywhere else on future visits. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Hotel! We stayed at this hotel over the Labor Day weekend and it was wonderful! I travel to New Orleans at least three times per year and have stayed at a dozen hotels in the French Quarter. None of them were as nice as this hotel. The rooms was spacious and clean. The pool area was great and the staff was over the top. We got great rates through a booking website and enjoyed our stay to the max. Location is unbeatable. Right on Royal Street and close enough to Bourbon (one block away) to get to the action quickly without hearing it all night. My only complaint was the $9.95 daily internet rate! Come on...even the budget chains give that free anymore. Great hotel! ',GOOD,
'Monteleon is Beautiful - The French Quarter in New Orleans is Back! After going to New Orleans for several years in a row for the Labor Day and having to miss due to Katrina, we were cautiously optomistic about returning in 2006. I'm extremely happy to say the French Quarter is back! Most of the restaurants have returned, the shops are open and the Monteleon looks great. We have stayed here before, but it's been polished up and the rooms although somewhat small compared to a mainstream hotel are extremely comfortable and luxuriously appointed at a very affordable price. Everyone in the hotel from the bellmen to the concierge and checkin staff were very friendly and welcoming (ahh that southern charm).This hotel is in the Quarter and even though only one block off the famous craziness of Bourbon Street, it's far enough away to avoid all the noise and you can get some sleep when you really want to take a break from the partying. Close to banks and ATM's, close to great restaurants and Harrah's casino -- all in easy walking distance! Very close to the galleries that line Royal street and just a few short blocks from the French Market, Cafe DuMonde and Jackson Square -- can't recommend this location and hotel more -- so glad to have them back! ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel I stayed here during Southern Decadence. The hospitality was great, the room was clean and the special room rates were a good value. They even placed a mini refrigerator in my room which really made it nice. The whole hotel was very well maintained including the pool.I would have given the Monteleone an Excellent rating, but they charge $9.95 a day for internet access. I can see a small fee, but most hotels these days provide access for free and $9.95 is steep. ',GOOD,
'Magnificent Hotel       Entrance At Night ',GOOD,
'First Class Hotel I highly recommend the Hotel Monteleone. The property is conveniently located on Royal St. in the French Quarter. The entire property was extremely well maintained, clean and neat. The employees were all very friendly and helpful. The pool area was very nicely looked after throughout the day. I found nothing that was broken, falling apart, non-functional, etc. I found a real bargain on the room rates through Travelocity. The bars and restaurants appeared very nice as well, although I only ate breakfast in the cafe. The food was good (standard breakfast fare). My only suggestion would be to offer a bit more variety on the buffet. They gladly checked our luggage when we arrived early, and again when we checked out since our flight did not leave until that evening. I am not a person who is easily pleased, yet I can say that not only was this hotel a great place to stay, the room rates made it a good value as well. The persons running this hotel are obviously doing a fine job. ',GOOD,
'Great but not perfect! I was lucky enough to visit New Orleans last year, just a few weeks before Katrina hit. I chose to stay at the Monteleone because I wanted a hotel that was close to the French Quarter but not too close to its heart, if you get my drift. I checked out their website and booked a standard room.The Positives: Very smooth check in, super friendly staff (I chatted with the doorman nearly every time I set a toe outside of the hotel), comfortable beds, a nice roof top pool....GREAT LOCATION. The hotel is literally two blocks away from Bourbon street, Canal street is maybe 3-4 blocks...I walked down Canal street all the way to the river, explored every inch of the FQ, and never had trouble finding the hotel afterwards. The Carrousel bar was also very fun, but (as per usual) the drinks weren't cheap.The Negatives: There weren't many, to be honest. My room had one King bed and was a bit on the small side with a nice view of a neighboring rooftop, but I didn't go to New Orleans to stay in my room all day. The biggest issue was with the soundproofing...there hardly was any! If the neighboring room's toilet flushed, I heard it. Fortunately I'm a heavy sleeper, but for those who aren't it can be annoying.Other than that I can't really say anything bad about the Monteleone. I would stay there again with pleasure and I highly recommend it...I would give it a 4.5 stars, if it were offered. ',GOOD,
'Services at Monteleone Hotel This was a very nice and convenient hotel however, the SERVICE is not up to the acclaimed 4 star quality rating. Upon check in, the three Front Desk Personnel were less than friendly or helpful. The word that comes to mind is SNOBBISH. It is located in the French Quarters.Housekeeping did not service our room one day until nearly 5:00 pm. We left the hotel for sight seeing before 8:00 am. This was disappointing because we were ready for a shower after being in the sweltering heat all day.Also be aware that New Orleans has no free parking. The area hotels charge extremely costly prices (up to $35.00 per day). The price at this location was $28.00. There are a few local garages for daily parking around $20.00 but, they do not allow vehicle in and out tours. Many establishments have not reopened since the Katrina hurricane. Check for local attractions hours and days of operation since they may not be available when you want to visit. ',POOR,
'Great experience overall This was our fourth trip to NO. We couldn't afford to stay in the FQ on our prior visits, but the tourism drop-off seems to have forced prices way down and all are competing. Searching hotels was fun knowing we had the chance to stay at a high end hotel in the FQ. Trip Advisor recommendations appeared to be the best overall for the Montleone at an average $95/night, so I called directly to book the room. We arrived on a Thursday, check-in was a breeze. Location was perfect, in the FQ but away from the !@#$%. We had a superior King on the top (15th floor) - comments of small rooms were accurate, but this is not a critical requirement for our hotel selection. Two elevators for our tower were a little slow, but considering the hotels age understandable. Views are possible but we didn't have one, which made sense given the rate we were paying. Several times I walked up to the banquet rooms on the top of the hotel where the view of the Mississippi is amazing and a great Kodak piture spot. We didn't dine at any of the hotel's restaurants, but we did enjoy the classy bar. Having a pool was a critical requirement, and the pool at the Montleone is very nice. Saturday afternoon was very crowded however. The service staff at the pool and bar was a plus.The bed in our room was fantastic, our room was quiet, the bathroom had no plumbing issues, and great water pressure. A week after our stay we're missing that matress (firm yet soft!). We would definately stay here again. Our best recommendation for dining is the Praline Connection, fabulous fried okra, fried chicken, and BBQ ribs! ',GOOD,
'Just Average If you get a good deal like I did... then it is worth it. The location is great - very close to Bourbon  Chartress. Also a couple of blocks from fantastic restaurants (i.e. K Paul's, Nola). Fun carrousel bar that stays open late. The rooms are nicely kept. The pool deck is very nice (rooftop), small bar up there. Friendly staff (we were at the pool and it started to rain... pool deck manager offered to call us when the rain stopped).The negetive stuff: Check-in was a nightmare! They couldn't kind our reservations (which were not made on their website). Had to wait a long, long time. The rooms are a little noisy, but you are in New Orleans... Don't replace toiletries every day. The French Quarter... well it wasn't crowded at all (4th of July weekend), but all the businesses were open. ',POOR,
'If you want to sleep -- not the place... Stayed here last weekend. Nice historic hotel. First room was OK, but sewage backing up into tub. Switched room, no problem. Getting sleep was another matter, very little sound-proofing into corridor. Noisy drunk revelers ALL night long -- front desk said what do you expect, it's the French Quarter! ',POOR,
'Fabulous Location My husband is coming to this hotel for a convention, so we took an early trip down to check it out. We had never been to New Orleans before, so this was an experience. For location, this hotel can't be beat! It's right in the middle of everything...Bourbon Street just a block away, and the Canal Shops and a host of other shops a short walk the other way.We were given a room with a view of the adjoining rooftop, but since we were out most of the time, it didn't matter. The room was lovely, but small...and the adjoining bathroom is small, but a good use of space. Be advised...I am 5'2, and felt like I had to stand on my tiptoes to brush my teeth because the sink is tall...but on the other hand, I practically fell into the bathtub because it's set about 1 1/2 inches lower than the level of the floor! If you do it once, you won't do it again, but to let you know...the first time's a doozie! I don't know if all the rooms are like this, but I'll be sure to watch out next time!We ate at both the Red-Fish Grille and the Bourbon House...both were excellent. The service was a little slow at the Bourbon House, but the food was served hot and was well-presented.As another writer had stated, there is a Wal-greens practically next door, and it was very handy for any little thing you may have forgotten.We went on the Cajun Encounters Swamp Tour. There were 10 of us on our particular excursion and we had a lot of fun...a very diverse group that was friendly and congenial. We had Captain Ted as our guide and he was knowledgeable and talkative and answered every question that was asked. We didn't see Big AL the male alligator, but there was another alligator that wanted to get on the boat with us, so that made the excursion a little more interesting. I would recommend this tour to anyone I knew was coming to this area.The people of New Orleans have been very friendly, and the cars let the pedestrians have the right of way with patience. That was something both my husband and I both noticed. They also blocked off part of Bourbon Street for a time period in the evening (I don't know if they do this all the time) so it is closed to vehicle traffic. That was great for just taking our time and wondering around and exploring.Looking forward to coming back in the fall for the convention! ',GOOD,
'Elegant, Convenient Hotel We were guest at the Monteleone on July 7-9. We had a suite and it was very nice. Service was great. We really enjoyed the great location. It is convenient to everything in the quarter. The only complaint we had was that the concierge did not seem to know the answers to questions we had. For example, the admission cost to the aquarium. She also told us to go straight down Canal St. and it was closer to go down Bienville St to acquarium. She did not seem to show much interest in assisting guests. However, we would stay at his grand ole hotel again. The bellman and bartenders were very polite. ',GOOD,
'Had a great time... I stayed at the Monteleone for 5 nights with a colleague, and I absolutely loved it. The room was very spacious (2 doubles) with a high ceiling and great bathroom. I used the rooftop pool every day for quick dips to cool off after walking around the French Quarter. I found Bourbon St. too tacky, but really liked the shops on Royal and Chartres, and found that the hotel was in a great location for accessing both the Vieux Carre and the 'new city'. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, and I would love to go back next year! ',GOOD,
'Our 3rd stay just as great as the first My husband and I have stayed at the Monteleone 3 times in the last 2 years. We've stayed at countless other hotels in New Orleans and it is our favorite. Each time our stay has been superb, before and after Katrina. We always stay when there is a special price of $99 per night for the superior king room. And of course parking is about $30/day....First, let me say....this is a very nice hotel... the history behind it is wonderful, and the carousel bar hard to beat. Second, yes ... there may be nicer hotels in New Orleans, but if you can get the special price, why stay somewhere like the Wyndam and pay out of the nose? You can't get too much closer to the action of the French Quarter than the Monteleone ... EVERYTHING is in easy walking distance, and far enough from Bourbon to enjoy it, but not hear it! If it is location, convenience, and nice comfortable beds you want... you won't be dissapointed with the Monteleone. Take it from someone who is from Louisiana and has been to New Orleans frequently! ',GOOD,
'Location can't be beat! Jazz Fest 06 was our second trip to NOLA and second stay at the Monteleone. As everyone says, the location is the best! From what I had read regarding staffing problems, etc., post Katrina we had minimal expectations for housekeeping and ancillary services. Couldn't have been more wrong. If anything the service from everyone from the doormen to the housemaids was way, way better than last time we stayed.... or maybe last time it was a given and this time we were prepared to forego some services. Whatever, it was great!Last time we were in a standard room which was tiny, so this time we paid the extra for a deluxe room ($283/night). Alas I'm a smoker so we were relegated to the 3rd floor in a room that was dingy, smelly and noisy to say the least. Not really complaining, it's the lot of a smoker, but I would despair if a non-smoker was ever in that room! The bathroom was clean, but unbelievably tiny and cramped (yet in the tiny room the bathroom was big) with nowhere to leave toiletries, etc. Quit smoking and request a room on a high floor.For the trip we are planning next year, we'll be in the City for 10 days. Despite the Monteleone's fantastic location and staff, unless I could afford a suite I'm afraid we'll be looking for a hotel with roomier accommodations (and please, please a window you can open) or a better rate.Regardless, if you are even considering a visit to New Orleans.... GO. It is so fantastic and they need and welcome tourists more than ever now. Tip big and enjoy! ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel! My husband and I recently stayed four nights at the Monteleone. We had a great experience. The hotel is beautiful. The room was small but very comfortable. It was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. They are situated a block from Bourbon St. which keeps you away from the craziness, but it's still a short walk to visit!The swimming pool, also small, was a must as it was very hot out.The next time that we are in New Orleans we will not hesistate to stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Nice location in the French Quarter The Monteleone is a New Orleans landmark and is located in the heart of the French Quarter on Royal St. I have stayed in many hotels in the French Quarter and I felt this hotel was average to slightly above average. I highly recommend entering the hotel from the main enterance on Royal street instead of through the parking garage like I did. Entering from the parking garage requires you to walk down a hallwayl that feels old and outdated.The lobby was nice but doesn't have the grand feel or very high ceilings that you would expect from 4 star rated hotels. The staff was very polite and well dressed. The hotel was clean but you can tell when walking through the hotel that it's old and has be painted over and over again.I paid extra to get a Deluxe room (largest available before upgrading to a suite) and felt that it was no bigger or nicer than any other hotel room. The bathroom was recently upgraded with marble and granite floors and walls, but they were fairly small.The bed was comfortable and the furnishing were up to date.I paid $119/ night for the Deluxe room. The standard room was available at $89/night at the time I stayed. That is an excellent rate for the French Quarter. ',POOR,
'Disappointed This review would probably be much more favorable had we not stayed at the Wyndham on Canal for our Anniversary last year. Read review awesome experience for that stay. We decided to try this hotel due to the summer special rates they were having. We were a little surprised that parking was $32, but in NO, you don't have much of a choice. Check in was quick and painless, but upon entering our room, I immediately thought something was wrong. I booked under a special with an upgrade to a superior room, and requested a room with a river view, mentioning several times it was my anniversary. The room was very small, not much larger than the king size bed in it. I called the front desk and was told that no river view rooms were available and that I was in the right room. We did have a nice view overlooking the FQ, but our windows had forehead smudge marks all over them. Yuck. I called the front desk again and requested a refrigerator, which was delivered to our room in just a few minutes by a man named Ceto who was very charming. After walking around we returned to our room to get ready for the evening. I pulled back our comforter and noticed hair on the sheets. It was just too late to change rooms, but that was a first for me. I can say that the convenience of being one block from Bourbon was really nice, especially after spilling something all over my pants and having just a short walk back to our room to change clothes. The Monteleone is right next door to a Walgreen's, and that was extremely convenient. It's also within a short walk to Cafe Du Monde and the Mississippi River. I will also say the room, although so small, was beautifully decorated with an antique look and the hotel as a whole was beautiful, inside and out. If convenience is important to you, this hotel will probably suit your needs, if you want a gorgeous hotel with outstanding service, go to the Wyndham. ',POOR,
'a great stay i travel for business every week or two and have high expectaitons for hotels. The Monteleone completely lived up to them. Lovely interior and the rooftop pool was the perfect place to get away from the French Quarter hubub. ',GOOD,
'Great experience at the Monteleone Just spent 3 nights at the Monteleone for a conference, and I had a great time. I was sharing with a co-worker and we had plenty of space. Check-in was problem-free. We were on the 12th floor in the middle (double-double room) facing Bourbon, and those rooms are slightly larger than most. Bathroom had obviously been redone recently, and it had lots of space for toiletries. Water pressure was good the whole time. Our ceilings were 12 feet high, and they really made the room seem spacious. I ordered room service once and it came promptly, and the food was delicious. Also went to the breakfast buffet in Le Cafe a couple of times, and that was also good if a little pricey. The Carousel Bar is great! All the people we encountered in the hotel were friendly, helpful, and so happy to have people visiting the city again.Only complaints: the room furnishings need updating. The bedspreads, curtains, and rugs probably should be replaced. Also, the smoke detectors have an amazingly bright green flashing light which is quite distracting! At first we thought they were the infamous Monteleone ghosts, but alas, no. HBO would be nice to have, too. ',GOOD,
'HATED it My fiance and I booked a room at this hotel based on many positive reviews from friends and family members who had spent nights there previously.When we arrived, we were disappointed right away. The check in desk took my credit card, even though we had already paid. Later on, we discovered that they had charged us a fee that they would refund after seven days, but they neglected to tell us. A staff member told me when we found out about this fee that they were supposed to inform all customers, yet she did nothing more to assist us with this problem. When we walked into our room, there were two beds (instead of the king we had been promised) and there was a view of rooms that were being redone. We asked, specifically, for a view. A GOOD view! The bathrooms were cramped, and housekeeping did not replenish our towels--I found out after I stepped out of the shower. When we talked to the staff members about our problems, their responses were weak. One lady said whatever and hung up the phone on my fiance!! The only good service we received was from the valets, who were extremely polite. Our room was terribly small, and the staff was unaccommodating. Unfortunately, we will never stay there again. ',POOR,
'Wonderful Hotel We recently spent 4 nights at the Monteleone hotel in New Orleans. I had my doubts how it would live up to expectations, considering all I've read about service and such after the storm. We had an absolutely wonderful stay. From the very start, the staff was friendly and very helpful checking in. Their were two couples and they had both of us checked in in the time it would have taken a single couple. Both of our rooms were spotless and after reading how small they would be I was surprised they were not that bad. The bathroom was exceptionally large and had space for all of our toiletries (which is rare). I looked everywhere and there was not a spot of mold. The Carousel bar was a nice place to start the evening (or earlier, if so inclined) and the bartenders were all very nice and accomodating. We booked a trip through the concierge, who was very friendly and helpful.We spent an afternoon at the rooftop pool. It was a little crowded, but we managed to find a spot and the bar was a wonderful thing to have during a hot afternoon! The location was wonderful, close to Bourbon St but we never heard any noise morning or night. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and I will definitely consider next time we visit New Orleans! ',GOOD,
'Great hotel in French Quarter We stayed at the Monteleone for the first time this past weekend. We were very impressed. Service was excellent. Room rates were very reasonable...summer specials started at the beginning of June and are very affordable. We stayed in a suite that was very nicely appointed for a good rate. They have an excellent, well equipped workout facility. Pool area is nice for daytime sunning. We had breakfast in the cafe one day and the buffet was very good. The bar in the hotel was nice, and lively. Location was really good...one block off of Bourbon St. We would definately stay there again, and highly recommend it. Thanks for the reviews on this site that led us to this hotel. Lastly, the French Quarter is 90+% back to normal...so don't hesitate to go back to NOLA! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful stay in a wonderful city My husband and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary in New Orleans this past Memorial Day weekend (May 26 - 29th). Our experience with the Monteleone was fabulous from our first contact with them. We found a deal at Orbitz ($162/night for one of their Executive Suites which usually run $700/night) that was obviously an error. We called the hotel, and as their website states, they indeed honored the rate. (Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!) We were even more thrilled when they gave us a room that had a jacuzzi tub and separate shower. Because they knew it was our anniversary, they had a chilled bottle of champagne and a card waiting for us. It was special from the moment we checked in!The hotel itself is ideally situated right in the French Quarter. One block away from Bourbon Street...far enough away where we experienced no noise from the late-night revelers. The lobby is beautifully appointed with gorgeous marble floors and crystal chandeliers. All of the staff, from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeepers, were great. Very friendly and courteous.The suite was absolutely luxurious. In fact, I have never slept in a more comfortable bed. The marble main bath with jacuzzi and shower was really spacious. We also loved having the second powder room in the living area of the room. Neither of the views were breathtaking....one side did have a distant view of the river, but who needs to see the view from the hotel when you can walk a few blocks and see if for yourself?We had drinks a couple of times in the famed Carousel bar. Very fun to rotate around the room. We met many nice folks in the bar...locals and tourists alike. The pool, though small, was awesome. Great waitstaff up on the roof, too.We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the Hotel Monteleone. It's all class, that's for sure! ',GOOD,
'Great stay at Monteleone! We (myself, husband and kids ages 6 and 3) stayed at the Monteleone on our way from Texas to Florida. It was CLEAN. The pool on the roof was BEAUTIFUL and perfect for swimming with little kids. The price was GREAT at $99 a night. The location was good, but kind of a long walk for little kids to Cafe Du Monde for breakfast. The bellmen and front desk clerks were very helpful. The concierge was okay - she sent us to Bubba Gumps for dinner which was loud, average food and expensive for the quality. I'm sure she took one look at my little kids and thought they could do little damage to that place. One negative was the noise on Bourbon street. Our room was on the 15th floor, but we could still hear revelers at night. BRING A WHITE NOISE MAKER WITH YOU. Luckily, I had brought my trusty box fan which I always use at a hotel to help drown out noises. Also, we had to park our car at a different hotel because Monteleone ran out of parking spaces. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend it for a family. One more point, the French Quarter has changed little just not as crowded and some stores/restaurants are closed. The rest of New Orleans, espcially downtown and east of downtown is strange. It's like a ghost town. Everything is covered in a grey film. Downtown hotels have reopened, but the office buildings and hospitals are are still abandoned with broken windows, many which have not even been boarded up. Abandoned cars sit under the highways. Driving along the highway east of town, entire neighborhoods are abandoned and seem to not have been touched since Katrina. At about 1 in 12 houses, you'll see a white fema trailer out front which is a sign of rebuilding. All the shopping centers are deserted and damaged except for building supply stores and car dealerships. It's spooky and sad. But do GO and TIP BIG. They need our help. ',GOOD,
'hotel monteleone My wife and I stayed at the hotel monteleone (5/19-5/21 2006). Wonderfully run, very comfortable hotel with a perfect location in the french quarter. The room was spacious, clean and well laid-out. No complaints at all. Could not hear anything from adjoining rooms (a big pet peeve of mine) which was a relief. Great shower too!Support New Orleans and treat yourself to some great food and music! ',GOOD,
'Fully Recovered! When my old college friend and I decided to re-visit New Orleans (where we went to college) for this year's JazzFest, we didn't know what to expect. The pre-trip research indicated that many of the open hotels in New Orleans were not 100% yet, i.e. either the housekeeping was minimal or the pool was closed. NOT SO at the Monteleone, where everything was great and in full working order! The gracious lobby is large, well lit and welcoming. There is also desk staff on duty 24 hours a day. The front lobby is not wheelchair-accessible, though. The staff were all very polite and cheerful although at least some of the desk staff did not know about the bus that has temporarily replaced the street car. Considering that St. Charles Avenue is very important for tourists, this was fairly important getting around information. The Pool lounge was beautiful and in perfect condition. The staff were great -- as soon as you used your towel after swimming, they came over to offer you another, new towel. The pool was spotless, but small. More for cooling off in than for actually swimming laps. But after a hot day walking around, it was so nice to relax and cool off before dinner, especially with a cool drink from the pool's bar.The hotel's restaurants and bars were open  serving -- unlike many other places that still have not recovered -- although we chose to explore for our meals, and did not eat at the hotel at all. But since the Monteleone is in a perfect location for exploring all of New Orleans, this was never a problem. The Monteleone is on Royal Street, so you are only one block over from Bourbon Street, the heart of the quarter. But that one block also makes a huge difference in terms of noise. Royal St. is generally very quiet and street noise was never an issue. Also from Royal St. it is easy to walk to the rest of the quarter, like Jackson Square, Cafe Du Monde, the French Market, etc. The Riverwalk Mall is also relatively close, as are the buses that go uptown and the streetcar, which is set to reopen soon.The room was large -- two double beds with a large space between them with the normal amount of additional furniture (desk, armchair in the corner, and the large bureau thing for TV, minibar and drawers). Plus a large double closet and two bathrobes! The room was not huge, but we didn't feel crowded once, the entire week. The beds were also very comfortable -- the linens were nice quality, there were plenty of pillows, and the bed was neither too hard nor too soft, as is so often the case in hotels. The bathroom was spotless and quite nice. Brightly lit, all modern fixtures, and great water pressure. Housekeeping came every day and was thorough. These may be things we all take for granted in hotels, but with New Orleans still struggling to recover and rebuild after Katrina, nothing can be taken for granted. We are probably going to go back next year, and will try to stay in the Monteleone again. I also travel frequently for business, and this would be a nice hotel for a business trip, too. I highly recommend The Monteleone!! ',GOOD,
'Fabulous time! My husband, 13 yr old daughter and I just returned from 5 great days at the Monteleone and New Orleans. The hotel is perfectly located - we never needed a cab! The hotel itself has a friendly, helpful staff. And this town is the BEST! I had never been to NOLA before, and thought I should be staying on Bourbon Street...but, no thank you! The Monteleone is an easy, short walk away on a beautiful street with many of the buildings listed on the Walking Tour of the French Quarter right on the same street! Bourbon Street IS a hoppin' place after dark, but during the day it's pretty bland. And this hotel is quiet - I cannot imagine how noisy the hotels must be at midnight on Bourbon Street.The Monteleone also has a rooftop swimming pool with a snack bar, which is a really quiet place to rest your body, and nice views.We ate at the Red Fish Grille twice because we loved it so much. You may have a wait for a table, but it is definitely worth the wait. We also really enjoyed K-Paul's. Make reservations for Friday/Saturdays! Chef Paul Prudhomme was present the night we were there, and the food was excellent - as was the Dixieland trio serenading outside the door.And - don't forget Cafe Du Monde - best beignets and coffee au lait. Go and Enjoy! ',GOOD,
'Love It! I am originally from LA, but live in Florida now. I will not stay anywhere else when I visit New Orleans. Looking forward to supporting the tourism of New Orleans next month with my first trip back since the hurricane. God Bless New Orleans. The Hotel Montelone is a 5 star, more than you would ever except hotel. Its excellent service and beauty is just the beginning. The location is wonderful for all those who seek to see the sites in New Orleans. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Hotel Back Again We just returned from a trip to New Orleans. We had booked the trip before the hurricane to stay in a different hotel. When the other hotel was not going to re-open by the time we were scheduled to come down, we re-booked with Hotel Monteleone. This was our first stay at the Monteleone and we were not disappointed. The hotel was beautiful. The staff was very friendly and helpful. While we were told some services were limited due to the hurricane, we did not experience any ill effects. Room service had not yet resumed and the pool and fitness center were also closed (although guests were given the option of using the services at a different hotel). We were told that maid service was being offered every other day but we were visited by the maid every day that we were there. The only negative comment I could possibly make is that the size of our standard king room was very small but we did not spend much time in the room anyway. We were very impressed with the quality of the hotel and services - especially this soon after the devestation of Katrina. ',GOOD,
'Coming BACK!!!       got my chair ',GOOD,
'Only Hotel I'll stay at in the Quarter!!! We have been going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans for 20 years and will not stay anywhere other than the Monteleone. The krewe at the Monteleone make our group feel like kings and queens!!! Our group grows every year due to the fact that when we bring people to the Monteleone, they see the great atmosphere and won't stay anywhere else.Also, the Monteleone was one of the only hotels that let their employees, families, and animals stay at the hotel during the aweful hurricane. The Monteleone family helped charter buses to rescue employees and guests. They truely care about the people who stay at their hotel.LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! ',GOOD,
'Everyone Had a Great Time We went with a large group of cloggers during the Jr Olympics (July 24 thru August 1) and the Monteleone was GREAT. We stayed at the hotel for a week and were extremely pleased with the employees and the staff.The kids loved the roof top pool and felt very safe in the hotel. This was important since we came in with about 35 cloggers ages 8-18 and entire families. The rooms did vary in size, however everyone seemed pleased. We have been very heart broken about the disaster of Katrina and hope that all the staff made it to safety. It is very moving to see areas that we visited a few weeks ago in such turmoil and we have them in our thoughts and prayers. ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel we have ever stayed in We stayed as a family of six (in 3 rooms, children aged 13-20yrs).From the moment we walked through the lobby doors we knew we were in for a rather special stay. The Hotel has magnificent internal decoration, and we felt slightly out of place staying in such a plush hotel. But the staff were very helpful at all times, and when we reported a minor problem in one of the rooms it was sorted within half an hour. We enjoyed dips in (and views from) the rooftop pool, and had one lovely evening meal in the main restaurant, as well as the obligatory cocktails in the superb Carousel bar.We loved New Orleans, and would like to return again (sans kids) to explore more and soak up more of the wonderful atmosphere of the Big Easy. There is only one place we would want to stay - the Monteleone - we can understand why it has many visitors who return year after year.I can see that there are one or two bad reviews - I doubt that there are any hotels on the TripAdvisor site with *all* good reviews. I can recommend this hotel without hesitatation - you will not be disappointed. ',GOOD,
'Monteleone Very Luxurious We were in New Orleans for a Conference and didn't book the rooms in time to get the hotels which were reserved. We found the Monteleone by accident on the internet. It was very reasonably priced and in fact was less than most of the hotels which had been reserved for the conference. We were very pleasantly surprised to find this hotel top notch by any standard. The Bellmen open the doors for you day and night and direct you up the red carpeting into the luxurious lobby. The rooms were beautiful. It's one block off Bourbon St. yet completely quiet. The staff was very attentive.I would highly recommend it and wouldn't stay any where else if we return to New Orleans. ',GOOD,
'Great weekend package A friend and I booked a 2-night package the week before Christmas 2004, just after the hotel's spa first opened. We had a great time. The room included the spa goodies and champagne we were promised as part of the package; it was big enough and it and the bathroom were sparkling clean. The breakfast buffet was good and the hotel looked beautiful for Christmas. The location was great for getting out into the Quarter on foot or catching a cab elsewhere. The layout of the spa was a little odd (we sort of loitered in the hallway to wait for our pedicures), but the massage was first-rate. Our room was right off the elevator but I don't remember it being particularly noisy--except when there was a Dixieland band playing out front on Saturday afternoon for a wedding (!). ',GOOD,
'Can't Wait to Go back First trip my partner and I had gone on so wanted everything to be perfect and it was. The hotel is located right in the French Quarter but away from the noise, everything was within walking distance. The Oyster Bar connected to the hotel had the best oysters, we ate there everyday!!! We had a standard room with a king size bed. A little small but very classy. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We enjoyed sitting by the pool and looking over the city. What can I say, we'll be back!!!! ',GOOD,
'Extremely poor service We were originally booked at another hotel, but based on the excellent reviews on this site, we changed our plans and called the Monteleone directly to book a non smoking Deluxe room with a King bed from Sunday through to Friday in June. We checked in approximately 6 PM on Sunday, and were told that we were being given a non-smoking room with two double beds. We asked if we could move to a non-smoking king room on Monday. At that point we were told that one of the hotel's buildings was scheduled for power work on Tuesday and that non-smoking king rooms were available and we could have a room in this building and would be moved on Monday morning when a room came free in the other building. We were told that the Hotel Staff would move our luggage to the new room and we would be able to pick up our new key cards when we returned to the hotel on Monday afternoon after a day of sightseeing and tours. We returned to the hotel at 2PM on Monday and were advised that check in time was at 3PM and to come back in an hour. We returned at 3PM and were told that our room wasn't ready and it should be ready by 5PM at the latest. I asked where our luggage was and was told it was still in the original room, and we were told we could return the room until our new room was ready. When we got to the room our cards had been deactivated, so we returned to the front desk and spoke to another clerk who told us that the power was being turned off and there was likely no air conditioning in that building. By this point we were tired and just wanted to rest. He checked again and advised that the room that we were to be given had yet to be cleaned and that they didn't seem to be able to give us another room (even though check in time is 3PM and other people were being assigned rooms). We then told the front desk clerk that we would be willing to pay for an upgrade to a Superior Room . He told us there were none that were clean. To this day, I still do not understand why he was not able to contact Housekeeping and request that they clean a room ... whether if it was the room that was assigned to us or an upgraded room.. By 5PM, I was beyond frustrated and returned to the front desk and spoke to another clerk. She seemed a bit surprised when she looked up my information and had brief conversation with someone else behind the desk. By this point I guessed that the room that had originally been assigned to us had either been given to someone else or was still not ready. We did finally get a new room by 5:30PM on Monday. By that point, I was extremely frustrated by the entire experience and by the overwhelming feeling that my business as a customer was not worth the effort of the front desk staff to resolve things in a reasonable manner. Because of this, we decided to find another hotel as it was unlikely that we would feel comfortable in this hotel.I understand that in some cases, mistakes and oversights occur, but unfortunately, our entire experience during our stay at the Monteleone was one issue after another. The people that we dealt with seemed either unable or unwilling to resolve any of the room issues that we had. Throughout our short stay, I never received an adequate explanation for why we were unable to get the room that we had originally booked and the only time that I received an apology for all the mix ups and delays was when I advised the front desk clerk that we were so dissatisfied that we were checking out. I've taken a closer look at the reviews on this site and found at least four other instances where similar situations occured in the last year ... a review from August 2004 describes and almost identical set of problems ... right down to a wing/building of the hotel having their electricty being shut off. I wrote to the Hotel mangement after this incident, but the only response that I received was a generic marketing email. ',POOR,
'Loved the Monteleone! The Monteleone is a beautiful historic hotel on a beautiful street. It is only a block from Bourbon St., but it is nice and quiet. Window shopping on Royal is a lot of fun, but unless your last name is Kennedy or Rockefeller, that is the extent of it. The breakfast buffet in the hotel Cafe' is very nice and the Hunt Club Restaurant is excellent. I would highly recommend a walk to Jackson Square and a swamp tour. (lots of alligators!!) Also, the carriage rides through the French Quarter are a fun and inexpensive way to learn about the area.P.S. Hold on to your purse, on Bourbon St., or better yet, leave it in your hotel safe. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful romantic getaway I'm a local who wanted a romantic in-town getaway for one night. The Montelone was so wonderful - everything was great. The room was beautiful and the service was great. I can't wait to go back sometime when we can hang out in our room more and stumble back from the carosel bar!!! :) ',GOOD,
'Don't Stay Here When we made our reservation weeks ahead of time we requested two beds (one for my daughter and one for me). When I checked in we were given one king sized bed that took up almost the entire room. Then we wanted to watch movies (the system was not working in our room). I had to call downstairs 5 times within 5 hours to ask someone to fix it. We got no response. It seemed like most of the people at the reception area had no interest in my problem and some had attitudes. The TV was fixed the next day and then we got bad reception. Also, if you get hungry in the middle of the night, you can't order room service after 11:00 p.m. Also, finding the swimming pool on top of the roof was another problem. You need a map and a compass to find it. Room was nicely decorated but bed was made up messy. I've had better service in Las Vegas at a 2-3 star hotel. Pass on this hotel. ',POOR,
'Loved it!!! I just spent 3 nights at the Monteleone and had a wonderful time. I was so impressed from the moment that I walked in. We had just come in from a cruise and got to the hotel about 10 am. I was just thinking to check my luggage and come back after check-in time, but they were able to give us a room right away. I had booked a standard double room on their website and didn't realize that it was for one bed. Since I was staying with my sister and my daughter, I needed 2 beds. They changed the reservation for me to an upgraded room (with a wonderful view of the Quarter) and didn't change the price. Every staff member that I came into contact with, the bellmen, the concierge, the maid, were wonderful. The buffet breakfast was delicious, and our waitress (I think her name is Lucille) was one of the best servers that I have ever had! The hotel was one block off of Bourbon, and an easy walk to the river, Jackson Square and the street car. I would stay there again in a heart beat! You will not be disappointed. ',GOOD,
'Great place to stay in French Quater New Orleans Stayed two nights at the Hotel Monteleone. We had a small room but it was very nice.. If you want to pay the price you can get a larger room. We were on the 8th floor and noise was not a problem.. It was one street over from Bourbon street in the French Quarter. The room was stocked with a mini fridge bar and snacks but items were quite expensive. Room was very clean. We ate at Mr. B's across from the hotel and the food and service was excellent. i would definitely stay at this beautiful old hotel again. ',GOOD,
'Nice Hotel, Great Location If you're looking for a full-service hotel in the French Quarter, then this is the place to stay. The hotel is located one block off of Bourbon Street in a quieter area known for its art gallaries, antique shops, and restaurants. The doormen, bellhops, counselior, and front desk staff were all pleasant and helpful, and actually seemed to enjoy their jobs. The roof-top pool and cabana bar is perfect for some afternoon R  R with a wonderful view of the city below. And the revolving Carousel Bar just off the Hotel Lobby (with lively piano music on Wed. - Sat. evenings) provides for interesting people watching in a relatively low-keyed environment.As some have pointed out, the rooms are on the smallish side, but compared to other New Olreans hotel rooms where we have stayed, they are well-appointed and comfortable, and the upper floors have majestic views of the French Quarter (ask for a room on floors 10 or up overlooking the Mississippi River). Depending upon when you are traveling, you may be able to land a room at a bargain rate compared to what you pay for similar rooms in other cities. For example, we booked a delux room directly through the Hotel's web site -- the day before we checked in -- for under $150 a night. Regular rooms were available for under $100 a night (although I suspect they were much smaller than the delux rooms, and have less interesting views). ',GOOD,
'I've never written before, but I have to now... I stayed at the Monteleone for five nights in early June. I've stayed in top notch hotels all over the world, and I have to say the Monteleone is among the best. I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews written recently. The people who said the rooms were old, unclean or poorly furnished must not have stayed in the same place I did. Yes, the hotel is old, but it recently underwent a complete renovation. Yes, the rooms are small, but so are most of the rooms in the Quarter. (In fact, most hotels of this age have smallish rooms). The personnel at the hotel couldn't have been more charming or helpful. We had a minor mixup with our car company, and the concierge took it upon herself to contact the company even after we had checked out to make sure our bill was not overcharged. I have never ever written a review of any hotel - but I just had to share my experience with the Monteleone. It is a real gem - in the US and the world. ',GOOD,
'A good hotel in a great location, but ... Stayed at the Monteleone recently, and I like to put in my fifty cents by writing this short review.The hotel is reasonably priced for a French Quarter hotel and is in a great location close to everything. The hotel is also a short block away from the House of Blues, which can make your stay a bit noisy in the early morning hours by late-night revellers who might awaken you.The hotel is a little aged and needs some work here and there. The rooms are nicely furnished, but sort of small and in need of a little cosmetic overhaul. The housekeeping staff could also do a better job cleaning the rooms as not everything in my room was properly dusted and vacuumed. In addition, the front desk staff was very slow while checking in new guests, and not always responsive by answering service calls made from the room.Giving my opinion after my stay here, I would in all fairness say that the Monteleone deserves at best an average rating, but definitely not any higher! ',POOR,
'Wonderful Hotel and Great Location My husband and I spent a couple of days in New Orleans before our honeymoon cruise. We spent two nights at the Monteleone (booked with hotels.com for $99/night). The lobby although small is beautiful. All the employees we spoke with were courteous and professional. The location couldn't be beat. It's a three-minute (if that) walk to Bourbon Street but just off the main tourist area so it's quiet and not as rowdy. Our room was small and didn't have much of a view but had all the amenities we needed. Be sure to stop by the hotel's Carousel Lounge. We went on a Saturday night and they had great live music. I would recommend the Monteleone to anyone staying in New Orleans. ',GOOD,
'Great for a Wedding Reception We had a wedding reception at Hotel Monteleone on June 4. We chose HM because it offered so much more than other hotels. The food was absolutely amazing. We had beef tenderloin (cooked to perfection), pasta station, chocolate fondue section, gumbo, jambalaya, 3 cold appetizers, 7 hot appetizers, a great bar selection, and Dr. Jazz  the New Orleans Dixieland Sounds for live music. Cheryl, the event coordinator was very nice and professional and did her job great. The wedding cake was a traditional New Orleans almond flavored cake, it was fabulous. The groom's cake may have stole the show. It was a very rich dense chocolate cake with chocolate covered strawberries. We had quiet time in Cheryl's office for about 15 minutes before we entered the reception so we could eat, use the bathroom, or just have a glass of champagne. Then after the reception they sent a cart of food to our suite so we could eat again. We stayed in the Hemingway Suite which is a penthouse suite with a great view of the city. We also blocked rooms for $99 a night. The rooms were great and some of our guests (including us) even experienced some of the haunted happenings of the hotel- hearing voices and elevators going to the wrong floors. The Carousel Bar is one of the best in the city (just off the lobby) and continued partying there well into the night. Overall the Hotel is one of the best in the city and if you are considering a function I am sure you will not be disappointed. ',GOOD,
'We love this hotel! We spent four nights at the Monteleone, June 6-10.We paid $104 per night for a standard room which was a bit on the small side but beautiful nonetheless. This hotel has the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on! I would love to have one at home!The Monteleone is in a fantastic location on Rue Royal. We were able to walk to all of our destinations within the quarter in only a few minutes.I highly reccomend the Monteleone! ',GOOD,
'Not worth the money we spent Wife and I stayed at the Monteleone in April when visiting New Orleans for a weekend, and the only positive we have to say about this hotel is that it has a great French Quarter location. In all other criterias the hotel failed to award it with a great review; at least in our opinion!For a high priced and high rated hotel, such as the Monteleone is, the rendered services do not at all match up with the value the hotel guests receive in return for the $$$'s spent for the hotel room at this hotel. The Monteleone might have been a great hotel in the past, but now in this century it shows that the hotel has aged and is old.The hotel needs (badly) an overall renovation. The (old) elevators are slow. The rooms are somewhat worn out, have thin walls and are very small with little space to move around. A view out of the rooms window is virtually non existent; maybe a tiny view overlooking Iberville and on some old buildings. The hotel staff does not seem to be very well trained and lacks real professionalism; certainly not that kind of professionalism that is expected standard from a first-class hotel with this high of a rating!The front office staff was not very friendly, and the housekeeping staff could have certainly done a much better job during our stay.In overall, we regret to say that we will not stay at the Monteleone ever again when we will return to New Orleans for another visit! ',POOR,
'Wonderful As many other users have said this is a spectacular place. The location is unbeatable and you can get a good rate here when certain specials are going on. We stayed a holiday weekend for $99/nt. The carosel bar is quiet nice so check that out if there is room. The rooms are fairly small but the beds are awesome with plenty of pillows. The roof-top pool is very pretty but the pool itself it small. You won't be disappointed with Hotel Monteleone. ',GOOD,
'Hotel Monteleone Awesome! My fiance and I went to New Orleans for Memorial Day. We researched plenty of hotels and were very pleased with our final pick - Hotel Monteleone! It was very clean, the staff was very friendly, and the location couldn't have been better - so close to Bourbon Street that we'd run back to the hotel during our evening jaunts to use the bathroom. I would highly reccomed this hotel for anyone traveling to New Orleans and wants to stay in the French Quarter. Also, be sure to check out the Carosel Bar - a nice change from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon St., yet its large windows are great for people watching. ',GOOD,
'Will never stay anywhere else!! This was our second time at this hotel. Upon arrival, I told the front desk that it was my b-day, and that my husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary also. Without even asking for it, the front desk upgraded us to a Suite and sent chocolate covered strawberries and champagne up to our room! The Suites are awesome. First time we stayed here, we had a normal room, which is a little small, but who stays in their room anyways? The Suites are huge with GREAT bathrooms (2 person Jacuzzi, seperate glass shower, 2 person sink all done in marble). The beds are so very comfortable. Burbon St. is one block away, and everything is walking distance from the hotel. The D-day museum is 8 blocks away, Cafe DuMonde is about 4 blocks away, French Market is about 6 blocks away (you get the picture).The front doormen are very helpful and nice. And don't forget the pool upstairs on the roof. It's wonderful...... with a pool side bar too. They make a really good Bloody Mary. Don't go to the Spa. Not worth the money. For my b-day gift my husband bought me a 90 minute massage. I could barely walk for the next 2 days even though I told the girl to apply less pressure. She wouldn't listen. Also, the girls who work the front desk have attitude.Needless to say, my husband and I will never stay anyplace else. GREAT, GREAT HOTEL ',GOOD,
'french quarter high life my wife and i stayed a few nights here and loved it. we found really great deals on the net during the off season. they have a great roof top pool and the Hunt Room restaurant in the hotel was excellent. the service was great and the location was perfect for french quarter site-seeing. i believe it is the oldest hotel in the quarter. very clean. ',GOOD,
'Proud to stay at the Monteleone The Monteleone is unique, and we had a sense of pride walking into this hotel. I called and received a $199 a night rate and were placed in a very nice, clean, king, smoking room (even though we would have preferred non, but the room did not smell at all). We were told at the desk that they had this room with a window, but no view. Well, when I opened the drapes (room 382) we had a view of the brick wall about 10 feet away. We had a good laugh. The room was very nice but small. The king sized bed (extremely comfortable!) took up much of the room and sitting on the end of the bed you could look up at the tv an arm's distance away. I also used the toilet lid for additional space for my brush and curling iron. The web site pictures are accurate but I thought everything was smaller in person. The only word I would Not use to describe the hotel is spacious. This is not a bad thing because everything you would want was in this hotel. It was a GREAT location! You are 1 block from Burbon street (drinking and food for all). A great location to also walk to the Market area in the French Quarter, down to the river and also a close walk to Canal Street (main street). The Carousel bar was unique and right off of the lobby. This bar was normally crowded. The only reason I did not rate the hotel as an excellent was that the bartender was more interested in the three girls at the bar than waiting on his customers. Customers ended up waving him down a few times. On the opposite side of the Carousel bar is another attached bar that is quieter where you can sit and talk easier. I also checked out the pool and workout room. VERY NICE! It's worth a elevator ride up just to check out the view. I read in other reviews that the elevators were slow, not a big deal. I think we opted for the stairs once in our 4 day stay. We didn't eat at the hotel. With all the choices for great food within a walk why would you. The staff was nice and the doormen even stood at busy times just holding the doors wide open. My husband and I heard it was haunted so we decided to check it out. We didn't see anything at all. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Comfort, Charm, Service. Monteleone was the total package This is my first hotel review even though I seem to be travelling constantly.The Hotel Monteleone was so ideal that it actually compelled me to seek out a place to extoll it's virtues.The service was unmatched in any hotel I've ever encountered. I never felt rushed, underappreciated, or secondary. Every employee I spoke with was perfectly charming and was willing to speak at length about the hotel's proud and interesting history. They also each excelled at their jobs...it's funny in retrospect but I can remember commenting to my business partner that the front desk was the best I've dealt with, the doorman was the friendliest, the bartenders were perfectly mannered and attentive - the maids were so friendly, bright, and interesting that I hated saying goodbye.The room itself was spacious and regal in it's colors and textures the appointments all seemed perfectly matched and THE BEDS, MY GOD THE BEDS!! If you are an insomniac please report to the Monteleone immediately. It's impossible to stay awake for long. The bathroom was huge and stately, though it had no fan, and the closet/storage space more than filled the bill.The location, however, was the key for me. Royal Street runs parallel to Bourbon and is less than a minutes walk, but the noise level is incomparable. I loved visiting on Bourbon - but wouldn't want to sleep there. The Monteleone gave us instant access to the best of the N'Orleans buzz but also instant peace and quiet of being just removed from the hyper zone. Perfect, perfect, perfect. I've stayed in hotels in every major city in the US, this is the one that finally got me to write a review. I wouldn't even consider staying in another hotel when I get back to the Big Easy. Top notch across the board. ',GOOD,
'Lovely hotel We thoroughly enjoyed out stay here, the service was very good and the location was excellent. The hotel is located ideally in the French Quarter one block from Bourbon Street, so far enough away to avoid the noise.The reason this hotel did not get five stars was due to the small room we were given (two double beds almost filled the room) and the service charge on room service; a required 18% 'gratuity' with a $2.25 delivery charge seems a bit too high particulary as the food wasn't great.A good hotel that I would recommend, although for a slightly quieter experience consider staying closer to the river instead?! ',GOOD,
'Just Yummy!!! My husband and I spent a weekend here and just loved it! The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. We had a beautiful view of the Quarter and Mississippi River from the top floor. We found the service to be very good although we never ordered room service. Restaurants and bars are very good. Atmosphere and location are Excellent! We'll definitely be back. ',GOOD,
'Hotel Monteleone was great! I did not know what to expect before arriving, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was. I've stayed in New Orleans countless times, but I had not stayed at the Monteleone until it was recommended by a friend. It is a classic hotel, with a perfect location. My room was quite nice and clean, and the staff (especially the concierge staff) was great. I will definitely be staying there again in the future.Also, this is a great alternative for business people who might otherwise stay at the Marriott. It is right around the corner from the Marriott and also close to the JW, Sheraton, and other hotels. ',GOOD,
'Great location! The Hotel Monteleone is a fabulous hotel located on Royal Street in the French Quarter. While the hotel lobby and bar remained somewhat crowded during our stay (suitcases and people everywhere), we really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel and the beautiful room. The pictures displayed on the Internet were an accurate representation of the hotel and the room we were given. This hotel is also in a great location. Everything is within easy walking distance. I will return to this hotel for my next visit. ',GOOD,
'Concierge Just returned from a long weekend stay in NO @ the Monteleone and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms are a bit small but very well kept up and appointed. The beds are very comfortable. Special thanks to Eva the concierge in the Monteleone who guided us to two fabulous restaurants, City tours and night club to see traditional cajun music all in all a very pleasant experience. ',GOOD,
'A Piece of History I just returned from a conference in New Orleans. I could not have been more pleased with my decision to stay at Hotel Monteleone! I have never been to New Orleans before and really wanted to experience New Orleans. I did not want to stay at a hotel chain, but rather at a hotel that has stood on its own generation after generation. My favorite spot in the hotel was the Carousel Bar. It was an excellent spot to meet people and unwind from a long day of meetings or sightseeing. The hospitality was remarkable. I never felt so comfortable and welcome like I did at Hotel Monteleone. The rooms are on the small side, but I did not feel crowded sharing my two-bed room with a coworker. I do question the practicality of families trying to fit a family of four into the rooms however. I read previous visitor's comments about the beds and let me tell you I can't stress enough how comfortable the beds and pillows are!!!!! I slept like a baby! I thought my bed at home was comfortable, but thank goodness the hotel offers sales of mattress and pillows. (Info can be obtained in the gift shop.) I am ordering my new mattress and pillows this week for home! The pool was great located on the roof. The workout room was located on the roof as well. I was disappointed that I ran out of time and never got the chance to make it to the spa for any treatments. (Next time) The location is wonderful. I was hesitant about walking to Bourbon St. at first. (which is only the next block over) But I was completely safe. I walked to Bourbon St., Jackson Square, to the trolly service on Royal without any problems. Yes, there is bad areas, but you use common sense. If noone is on the street then you probable shouldn't be either. If you want to experience true southern hospitality and a comfortable stay in a perfect location then I recommend the Hotel Monteleone. Enjoy! ',GOOD,
'Loved the Monteleone!!! I stayed here with my girlfriend in January 05 and we loved this old hotel. We got a vieux carre suite for $199 and it was worth every penny. Our suite had a master bathroom with a seperate jacuzzi tub and shower marble floors and dimmable lighting. There was a half bath off of the living room. These suites are on the corners and have good French Quarter views. I've heard that regular rooms can be small and this suite usually goes for $700 so you might want to look for deals. The lobby is beautiful and the carousel bar is fun. Staff was friendly and accomadating. We only had two complaints. 1) Doorman consistently did not open door 2) Slow elevators. Everything thing else was wonderful. ',GOOD,
'what a lovely hotel We stayed at the Monteleone the week before Easter. The hotel has an old world feeling with modern conveniences. The room was very clean and decorated nicely. After days of sightseeing the room was always cleaned and ready. The location was perfect. I would highly recommend staying here and we would stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel The Monteleone is a beautiful hotel and a great location. It's located within walking distance to all of the downtown attracitons. It is just 1 block from Bourbon Street. We enjoyed the nicely decorated rooms and the excelent service we recieved. It was also a good value. I would definately return to this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Great renovation work...perfect location My wife and I stayed at the Monteleone over Christmas holidays, and we were very impressed with the room (upgraded to a suite with a view over the Quarter), the staff and the quality of the renovation work throughout this wonderful facility. The location might be the best in town, being literally minutes from too many great restaurants and pubs to mention, Bourbon Street, Jackson Square....and Rue Royal is right out the front door.The Carousel Lounge is great; stop in and sit at the piano with George when he's on. ',GOOD,
'This is a tough one The positives first...the atmosphere was wonderful. the location was perfect, the room was very nice, had a touch of quaint, but was large enough to be comfortable. This was the first time I've stayed at the Monteleone, and for the money, was a good choice. When I was headed there from the airport, even the shuttle driver told me I was in for a good time.Now the negatives, which seem to be a common complaint in these reviews. I was none-too-impressed with the staff and service. Check in time is at 3pm. I arrived at the hotel at 12:45pm. I knew that was too early, didn't expect a room, so I checked my bags and went out. Checked back at 2, still no room. Back at 2:45, room wasn't ready. Basically, when they say 3, you check in at 3, not a minute earlier.When I was there, you had to call the front desk to get ice. I called three times, all three times I had to call back to remind them, the third time they never showed. When they brought the ice, it took over an hour.So five stars for the hotel, one star for the staff and service. I won't be back. ',POOR,
'The perfect Valentine! I was there for a conference, but since my husband came along, this beautiful hotel and its prime location in the French Quarter turned a dull conference into a wonderfully romantic pre-Valentine visit. Gorgeous, immaculately clean room, with a beautiful bath and every conceivable amenity (ok, no view, but I honestly only looked out the window once, when I drew the drapes!). The staff was courteous and helpful, and the doormen were priceless - vast resources of information about restaurants, ghosts, history - you name it! Only blip - their beignet were not so tasty as was Cafe Beignet's just two blocks down - check them out! ',GOOD,
'Great local flavor... We've stayed at the Monteleone the last three times we've been in New Orleans and have adopted it as our hotel.  It has an ideal location,..so close to the action on Bourbon, but amidst a very nice shopping stretch on Royal Street. Restaurants, music, nightlife abound within comfortable walking distance. I've been told that the hotel is one of the city's oldest. It is very well-maintained, yet has a feeling of rich history.  The lobby is beautifully decorated, and the Carousel Lounge is one of the most interesting hotel hangouts in the city. We have not eaten at the upscale restaurant here, but have been quite pleased with the other two restaurants. The Aft Deck is particularly appealing...very nice for casual dining or to sit down for a drink while watching the passersby on the street.  The rooms are quite nice, though some are small. The service we've experienced has always been exceptional. Many people have taken that extra step or two to make our visits special ones.  We've stayed during MG week and at other much slower times. The experience is consistently excellent. I strongly recommend this hotel  ',GOOD,
'Hotel Monteleone is tops! The location could not have been better. The service from the front desk to the cleaning service was prompt and polite. Upon my request at the front desk, my hypoallergenic pillow beat me back to my room. Cozy, comfortable bed! The bathroom had to be the sparkling cleanest in town, with not a stray hair to be found. The business services department personnel were very helpful as well, even though I wasn't there on business. There are inside rooms without a view, if important to you, though. Mr. B's across the street is GREAT for lunch.  ',GOOD,
'Loved it!! Awesome hotel in the heart of New Orleans, beautiful room a little small but the beds were sooo comfy, and great pillows too :) Can't say that about many places. If you stay here make sure you go up to the pool, it has a great view... Splurge if you can to stay here a night or two. It is a little pricey, and it's supposed to be haunted :) We didn't see any little ghosties, so I wouldn't worry about it... Also, take the haunted history tour, it was fun!! and eat at Zydecue and Fiorellas, Fiorellas is a locals place that is across from the french market.. ',GOOD,
'Agsin and Again Have stayed at the Monteleone each time our professional organization has it's conference in New Orleans. We are scheduled to return in March and will stay there again. There is no equal in this city. Good old fashoned service in a great location. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Stay Wonderful hotel, excellent location! You are in walking distance (minutes) to Bourbon Street, Canal Street, and the French Market. The rooms were beautiful, not large, but definitely enough room for two. The hotel has completed $70 million in renovations, and it shows. The bathroom was decorated with marble tile and granite countertop. The shower was great- lots of pressure and no temperature fluctuations. The hotel bar is unique with a revolving central carousel. The Hunt Grill was wonderful- try the crab bisque and crab cakes. They left an offer in our room for a free bottle of wine with 2 entrees in the restaurant, which was a nice touch. We would definitely return to this hotel! ',GOOD,
'I'd stay there again and again This is a beautiful hotel, in the best of locations. Royal St is a wonderful place to be. It was very clean, the people pleasant, and the the room very nice - though smal, but it is an older hotel. I have never been able to sleep in a hotel all night long - I wake up and the beds are awful. The beds here are so comfortable and the shower pressure is great. It is pricey, but we knew that. I chose this hotel on recomendation, and I will recomend it my self. ',GOOD,
'Want to go back! My daughter and I enjoyed our winter visit to New Orleans and found the Hotel Monteleone to be absolutely wonderful from the cuddlely robes to the beautifully appointed room. The staff was superb. The front desk and other staff accommodated our every whim. Security even helped tremendously when I left my camera in the room's safe. I will definitely stay again if I ever get a chance to return! ',GOOD,
'So much potential, but... This hotel is beautifully furnished, and the lobby is exquisite. However, the rooms are not the best, unless you're willing to pay top dollar for one of their better rooms. This hotel is no way near five stars. I guess the people who leave such high ratings are the ones who are used to staying at chain hotels. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. Le Pavillon is far superior, especially for the price. ',GOOD,
'True Deep South Elegance My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Monteleone for 4days and we absolutely loved it! This hotel is the oldest family-owned hotel in New Orleans and the attention to detail is seen from the Southern hospitality of the doorman to the shinning chandeliers. This hotel is one of the most historical hotels in the French Quarter and used to be a meca for literary icons such as, Truman Capote and Ernest Hemingway. The location is right on Royale street across from the beautiful antique shops and close to Antoine's and other wonderful restuarant's. We stayed three nights in a standard room, which is small, yet one must remember they are in the French Quarter. If you are from the Deep South or have travelled to this part of the country before, one knows of the limited space in one of the oldest cities in this young country of ours. We also stayed in the Ernest Hemingway suite which is the penthouse and it is exquisite! The room opens up to a private terrace and access to the roof top pool. Overall this is a place to call home in one of the most European and exciting cities in the USA. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Hotel The Monteleone has been around and still reminds you of the old style hotels in a Humphery Bogart movie. The rooms have great views and the price was reasonable.The only bad part of my stay was the girl I was with! - Check out the lobby and the pool - there classics. ',GOOD,
'Don't be fooled by appearances! The Hotel Monteleone has only two things going for it....location and looks. But, don't be fooled...the rooms are way overpriced for what you actually get and the hotel staff are anything but customer-service oriented. I'd say they were downright rude. Not to bore you with the details, but while I was staying there in December, I tripped and fell onto a couple of steel ladders that were left around a corner on the floor by some elevator repairmen. I really hurt my back pretty badly. Once the hotel staff heard the story, they decided that they were not legally responsible (since the ladders belonged to the elevator company and not the hotel) and were pretty much DONE with me. I spent the whole last day of vacation in my room and nobody from the hotel contacted me to see if I was okay until 10 p.m. that night, when I was already trying to sleep. At one point during the day, my husband called the desk to see if they could send up an ice pack or heating pad, and they curtly directed him to the nearest Walgreen's drug store. All I can say is this: There are a lot of hotels in New Orleans with good location, good looks, and better service for less money. Find one and stay there...not the Hotel Monteleone! ',POOR,
'Not a good choice ! If I could have rated this hotel zero, I would do.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, as I had a very similar experience to someone below, wherin I had prebooked an upgrade to a Deluxe king and was charged for this, even though I was obviously put in a superior/standard room.This was a special occasion for us, and although I did not let it be ruined, I did expect some recompense.Today I rcvd a response to my complaint, and an apology is certainly not enough.As far as I am concerned they are crooks, and if you care to peruse previous reviews, I am not the first, nor will be the last to experience this!! ',POOR,
'classy place the best location in the french quarter but close to canal st, casino, aquarium, shopping, streetcars-very nice rooms and baths. 'definitely will be back. ',GOOD,
'Small things add up. We just spent 4 days over New Years at the Monteleone, and based on the web site and the reviews many things were very nice. The location is great and it is a classic and beautiful hotel. The room was lovely and clean, and the service was decent. BUT small things can ruin a stay and the odd thing is that most of these things never occur at other hotls of this quality.First right over our bed were 2 very bright obtrusive smoke alarms that blinked quite brightly all night. I was able to sleep, but just not that well. Then the Bet while comfortable had a mattress and Box spring that translated every single movement of my partner into an earthquake. also very unsettling. Finally we had an early flight and needed a 4:30 am wake up (ugh) I called to confirm this twice so as not to mess up, but they called be at 4 am. not a huge thing, but at that time of the morning every extra minute is precious. Little things left me feeling unrested. ',POOR,
'Classic Lady for the right person. I have been visiting New Orleans once a year for the past 24 years. Last year I stayed at the Monteleone for the first time. It's a grand hotel with a magnificant lobby. I was there for a conference and the room I was put in was small and overlooking Iberville with little view of anything but some buildings. Room was exceedingly small. Too small for the two of us. If there are bigger rooms I would highly recommend them or you will be disappointed. The roof pool is amazing and a wonderful treat. The bar is nice and revolves. The concierge was a woman who could hardly care about helping me find reservations to a restaurant and was not helpful in the least. The front desk staff was ok, nothing to write home about. Location is great. Can't be beat.If you like location and the chance to stay in a wonderful slice of old New Orleans then you will like this place. Just upgrade to a new room and have your dinner reservations prepared ahead of time. ',POOR,
'What a GREAT!!!! Place We just got back from staying 3 nights (12/27-12/30) at the Monteleone and it was fantastic. The location is perfect, close enough to french quarter and bourban st. but far enough from the noise. We walked every where, ie: french market, riverwalk, trolleys, ect. The service was wonderful. Frank the doorman made us feel right at home from the minute we stepped out of the shuttle. Talked to us every day. Every staff member greeted us with a hello and how was our stay. We were in the elevator when a regular bellhop came in and asked if we needed anything and hope our stay was going well.  Reading the other reviews about the rooms being small, I saved and got the renovated mini suite (special at 189.00 per night) and it was well worth it. View of the river (yes some building tops to, but that did not bother us) and the paddle river boats. The decor was excellent and fancy. It came with a jacuzzi tub and seperate all glass shower. They turn down the beds and leave you chocolate. Bathroom fixtures were gold plated and marble counters. Towels were all folded fancy and there was even a sticker on the toilet paper to hold a fancy fold. There is internet service, but you have to pay for it. The hotel cafe has the best breakfast buffet at 13.00. The TGI Fridays a block away also has a buffett which is cheaper (11.95), but it is not as good. Walgreens is just across the street for other needs like snacks and meds. All in all it was a great experience and we will definetily go back to the Monteleone. If you have any questions, shoot me an e-mail. ',GOOD,
'A move up! After booking another hotel for our trip and being very disgusted in our choice, we took the advice of an aquaintance and moved to the Monteleone. The room was small, but very nicely decorated and CLEAN! We found the service to be wonderful - the staff friendly and helpful. Our vacation was in December until the 15th. The location is also another asset. Beware of the trolley. It does not run on time and the wait can be lengthy. We came in out of the blue and asked for adjoining rooms, since we were traveling with another couple, and they immediately placed us with no problem. The rate was great too! ',GOOD,
'Hotel is a mix bag Stayed here in September on business. I got to the hotel in the early evening. It had been a long flight and I was hoping to find excellent serivce. That was not to be. I got out of the cab to find no one at the door. I had to manage the door and my luggage up the stairs to the lobby. The first room I was put in was on the seventh floor. After checking in there was again no one who could be found to assist with the luggage. I should add here that as a woman traveling alone I value this sort of service. Upon arriving at my room, the first thing I noticed was that the door on the room did not close properly and that it was across from a maid closet. At that point I was too tired to care. I should have. I awoke at six in the morning to the local gossip courtesy of the maids. I could clearly hear the whole tale. They did seem to be concern that the guests might be sleeping. I contacted the front desk and they agreed to move me. I was moved to a room on the 12th floor much quieter. The front desk indicated someone would help me change rooms. By late in the day no one had arrived. I went to the front desk got the new room key and moved myself. The new room was much better. During the week I stay the daytime doorman was rarely avalible to open the door, instead he spent most of the day talking on the phone in the entry way. I never did see any one from the bell staff. When I checked out, again no one was around to help with my luggage so I did it myself. ',POOR,
'Stay away from this one!! My husband and I booked a deluxe king, non smoking room with a river view for our anniversary and when we checked in we were given a small room with ashtray and overlooking rooftops. When we returned to the front desk to tell them of the mistake, the booking manager Theress came out to tell us that was all she had. The ashtray; all rooms are supplied with ashtrays. We tried everything but she wouldn't budge. She made no effort at all to be helpful. We returned to the room and really had an awful stay. The walls are paper thin, you can hear everything in the next room, even though the people were having normal conversations. The rudeness of the booking manager was insulting but she had the power and we were stuck. Hope this will dissaude you from going here. There are too many other choices! 12/26/04 ',POOR,
'Not Bad overall My wife and I statyed there for 5 nights, and overall we had a pretty good time. The breakfast served at the hotel is one of the best in the French Quarter. They have a booth in the lobby for Grayline Tours. This makes it easy to do all your trip booking while you stay at the hotel. We found the staff to be very friendly, and attentive. The only problem we found was the policy on smokers. My wife and i do not smoke and specfically asked for a non smoking room. While this was all confirmed prior to check in they placed a smoker in the room next to us. The rooms allow you to smell the smoke very well due to the way theyare constructed. The hotel made it up to us by upgrading our room and from that point on the stay was very pleasant. You will pay $22.00 a day for parking, but that is the case no matter where you stay in the french quarter( prices may vary from place to place but $20 is the average). The standard rooms are ok from what we could see but the deluxe rooms are much better, and the suites are well worth the money. Check the online get the best deal on your room per night. ',GOOD,
'wonderful hotel I just came back from an exciting trip to New Orleans during the Thanksgiving break. I stayed at Hotel Monteleone for 3 nights. My room was on the top floor. There wasn't much view because it's facing a building and the bottom window glasses were opaque. The room was on the small side, but it has enough space for a king-size bed, a huge TV cabinet, a nightstand, a desk, a chair and a sofa. I absolutely loved the bathroom, which was very spacious with great black marble floor and spotless bathtub. It was very quiet at night. The hotel staff were very nice. The location is great! It is one block off Bourbon street and very close to a few of my favorite restaurants, such as Acme's Oyster Bar, Mr. B's Bistro, Bourbon House Seafood, and Felix's Restaurant. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful!!!! My husband and I spent 3 nights here recently. We were pleasantly surprised with our standard room. It was nicely decorated, clean and quite spacious. The location is excellent- just one block from Bourbon Street, and an easy walk to some great restaurants and Riverwalk. Be sure to have a drink at the Carousel bar located in the lobby. ',GOOD,
'Best Stay As the picky general manager of a upscale Hotel, I did my research and picked this hotel. It was one of the best hotel stays I have ever had. The location is the best in town, you can walk to everything. The rooms and service were excellent, no wonder its a family owned and operated hotel. Will without a doubt stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Best of everything in NO Location...location...location!!! The Monte is located in the French Quarter, but on Royal St which is much quieter than the wild and crazy Bourbon St only one block away! You will love everything about this beautiful hotel ... even though, as previously reported, the rooms are not massive. We had a superior deluxe king room ... a square room with very tall ceilings giving it the illusion of being larger than it actually was. Along with the king bed the room offered a comfy chair, desk, 2 side tables and a massive armoire housing large TV, mini-bar, adequate drawer space, narrow side closets, ironing board and iron. All bathrooms are luxurious with marble and granite and a wonderful shower with powerful jets. All rooms should be equipped with robes ... our wasn't, but we called and they were immediately delivered to the room. When we return it will definitely be to the magnificent Monte.A note about the food in NO ... the best on this PLANET! The Commander's Palace located in the quiet and beautiful Garden District is a MUST! We've had food and service comparable only in NY at Le Cirque and in Venice at Harry's! Also, if you like gumbo, you shouldn't miss the Gumbo Shop and the Sunday jazz brunch at Arnaud's was lovely, but I think we should have tried The Court of Two Sisters for their renowned jazz brunch as we heard rave reviews! ENJOY! ',GOOD,
'Disaster. Got walked to a non-French Quarter lower grade hotel After making reservations weeks in advance, they call me two days prior to trip to tell me they are overbooked. Say they got me a room at another place. Rather than staying in French Quarter, we were walked all the way to warehouse district, 1.5-miles away to a Hilton Garden, which is a much lower star rated hotel. Kicker is we had to pay same rate! I asked reservations manager why we weren't found a room in French Quarter and she said it would have cost them too much, even though rooms were available!Had to spend $20 a day on cabs to get to our conference in the Quarter. Same manager blamed the overbooking on their computer system. Offered to find us a room in the French Quarter but then never returned call.I assume they don't treat their actual guests much better. As a frequent traveler to New Orleans for business, I will never do business with this hotel again. ',POOR,
'Terrific Standard Room and Upgrade to Suite I loved this hotel! When I was a very poor student in New Orleans, I would walk by the classy hotels in the Quarter and dream about staying in one of them someday. Finally stayed at the Monteleone in late August for a meeting and was assigned a standard room in the older wing. The elevator was old and slow (ok by me), but the hallways were plush and quiet with large heavy doors leading into the rooms. My room on the 7th floor was an interior room, so no view, but the styling was classic and delightful. Wonderful marble bathroom, a really cozy and luxurious feel (and only $99 for the conference rate). A totally suitable and sufficient experience, but on my last day of the meeting, upgraded to a suite (room 1280?) on the corner with a great river and Quarter view. The bathroom was a trip, and as many windows as I've ever seen with very plush interior (cost 159.00 to upgrade, however, but a really nice splurge). This is a great old-time hotel with real comfort, especially for the price. And the pool area and bar are also the best, with a sensational view. Highly recommended, but don't know about the newer wing of the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Monteleone was wonderful for my parents I sent my parents to New Orleans as an anniversary gift and it was very important to me that they stay in a hotel with friendly service and nice amenities. They stayed 3 mights at the Monteleone and said it was wonderful. I contacted reservations to make sure the room I had reserved was in fact a deluxe with a window, large room and a nice view. The reservations manager was extremely polite and helpful, and they upgraded my parents to a suite and had a bottle of wine and some chocolate covered strawberries waiting for them upon arrival. Although it rained in New Orleans the entire weekend of their visit, my parents were very happy because they were so close to everything and their room and hotel was so beautiful they didn't mind being indoors more than planned. I have not stayed at this hotel myself, but plan to the next time we visit, especially after such wonderful reviews from my parents. ',GOOD,
'Suited us Well The Monteleone was not our first choice, but NO was busy that weekend. We'd hoped for somewhere a bit more typically French Quarter with all the wrought iron  stuff. But at the time we went (April 2004) the 拢 was very strong against the $ and we felt we could splash out a bit.The Monteleone was very comfortable, and conveniently located. The only thing wrong with it was that it lacked some of the character that we look for in hotels - though it did have more character than an anonymous chain hotel. The Carousel bar was fun, though not cheap, and the roof terrace was a good spot to relax in the middle of the city.No reason to advise anyone not to stay here! ',GOOD,
'Monteleone - class and location Just got back from a wonderful, long weekend in New Orleans at the Monteleone. This hotel is perfect for couples or for friends on a reunion trip, which is what I was doing. The location is excellent. No worries about getting anywhere - you can walk. The hotel is filled with history and has the ambience you want in a city like New Orleans. The room was wonderfully decorated and the price we paid per night was excellent - much lower than the advertised rate. So I'd suggest calling and talking to them personally to see what can be done. I don't know what kind of accommodations they have that would be suitable for children. The bar in the hotel has lots of history, too, and it revolves. I will definitely return and highly recommend it. ',GOOD,
'Love the Monteleone!!!!!! The Monteleone was a great experience, and I definitely plan to return. I stayed in the standard room and got a low $89 off-season rate. For that price, I was blown away by how nice the room was, and in the future I'd be satisfied paying significantly more for the same room. The rooms were very well decorated and came with all the amenities you'd expect, the baths were granite and marble, the beds were plush, and of course it was all immaculate. The hotel has a great location on Royal Street, and the Carousel Bar downstairs is a fun novelty. One caveat: do remember that parking is an additional fee and requires you to use the valet service. But, you have complete freedom to come and go from the garage, and you can't expect any better parking situation in the French Quarter. In sum, this is one great hotel! ',GOOD,
'Five Stars!! We stayed at Monteleone last weekend  loved the place. The hotel rooms are spotless, the rooms are beautifully decorated and now I understand the bragging on the beds! It was pure luxury. The staff catered to our every need. The breakfast bar was impressive  that gravy was to die for! And when we returned from breakfast our room had already been cleaned. Being able to access the internet from our room was a nice surprise  the minibar was nicely stocked  fairly reasonable. I did question whether or not we had a deluxe room it did seem small, but they said that we did. We stayed on the 3rd floor, but next time I would definitely request an upper floor from what I hear. It is located in the middle of everything  it's like an oasis from the busy streets of New Orleans. I definitely will return. ',GOOD,
'Love The Monteleone We just returned from a wonderful weekend in New Orleans. We loved The Monteleone, great staff, make sure and check out the Carousel Bar, heavenly beds.... location, location ',GOOD,
'Good stay We recently spent eight nights at the Monteleone. Overall, it was a very good stay. We cannot say enough good things about staff we experienced; Raoul, one of the bell staff, was helpful and kind; Silvio, in Le Cafe, was a marvel at putting a smile on our faces at breakfast every morning; Marvin Allen (try his awesome award-winning Southern Comfortini!), Michael, and Parker at the Carousel Bar were excellent in their service; and housekeeping/turndown service was wonderful, except for the second Saturday, when our room was not made until between 3:30 or 4 in the afternoon, and we were not given enough towels. The hotel is very clean, classy, and quiet, no issues at all with the building or service staff. My only complaint with this establishment is that I was told we had a deluxe room, which is the largest of rooms before bumping up to a salon or suite, BUT we actually had a superior room (larger than standard, but smaller than deluxe). We had no problem with that since we had summer rates, but when I attempted to book again for December over the phone, I asked for a DELUXE room SIMILAR to the one we had this summer, meaning deluxe king bed, high floor, river view. I was booked over the phone at the deluxe rate, then found on the confirmation email I was booked for a SUPERIOR room. I inquired via email about that, explaining that we had requested a deluxe room SIMILAR to the one we had stayed in, and I was told the room we had this summer WAS a superior room, then when I again requested a deluxe room via email, I got no response. I then called the hotel to cancel the reservation. I was asked why, and I told the representative we could stay in a suite elsewhere for about the same price as what they were charging for a superior room, when we had requested a deluxe room, and I knew full well deluxe rooms were available. I was told, Thank you. Here is your cancellation number.... Be very specific with the room you reserve here. We would not hesitate to stay here again, due to the terrific service from the staff you actually have face-to-face contact with, but we would appreciate up-front truth about the room we are reserving from the reservationists over the phone and via email. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful place to stay! Just came back from NO! Had a wonderful time. Stayed at the Monteleone and enjoyed every minute of it. Got a standard room with two double beds which appeared to be a little larger than the one kingsize bed in the other rooms. Very tastefully decorated and clean I cant say enough good things about the beds. Soooo comfy! Employees of the hotel were friendly and don't forget to see Mike the bartender at the Carousel Bar. He made us feel right at home. The location is within walking distance of just about everything. I will definitley be staying there on my next trip. ',GOOD,
'Best Trip Ever Just returned from a perfect trip to New Orleans.Can't say enough about the hotel.Great location - steps to bourbon street but did not hear any of the late night noise at all. Royal street is beautiful.Front desk couldn't have been more helpful along with all of the other staff. When I return - hopefully next year, this will be the only hotel that I will stay at. Had previously stayed at the Sheraton - nice hotel but did not have the location or the atmosphere of the Monteleone ',GOOD,
'Bellisima! We love this hotel! My sons and I stayed there on two occasions and we had spacious, nicely decorated rooms with lovely bathrooms and views of the French Quarter. The lobby with its painted ceiling, crystal chandeliers and grandfather clock is gorgeous. The hotel is in a terrific location and quiet (guess we missed the construction). We enjoyed swimming in the lovely rooftop swimming pool and working out in the modern fitness center. Staff was friendly and helpful. Going in the summer, we got great rates. We will definitely return to the Monteleone, but will make sure to ask for a deluxe room since other reviewers have complained of the small size. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Monteleone My girfriends and I always plan a summer trip for the Girls only. This year we went to the Essence Festival July 2-4. We stayed at the Hotel Monteleone. The hotel was fabulous; the rooms were very nice and clean.. and the staff was very friendly and accomodating. Had such a wonderful time; I will be staying there again next month when I go back for a Business trip. ',GOOD,
'The Best Location in the Quarter, So Overlook a Few Things The Monteleone is right on Royal Street a few blocks from Jackson Square. This is really one the busiest but prettiest parts of the Quarter, especially early in the morning. Check out the alley behind the hotel and also the nearby Napoleon House Bar.It is true that the rooms are quite small, but isn't that really true of all old hotels. And Truman Capote wasn't concieved in one of your fancy new hotels was he?So, go and enjoy the lobby, stepping out right in the middle of everything, and stop holing-up in your room, do that at home. ',GOOD,
'Encountered Many Problems Before I go into the problems we encountered I also want to say that the hotel itself is very nice, the rooms are tastefully decorated and the bathrooms are beautiful. The rooms are tiny, so if you are traveling with children you will feel very cramped (we had our children with us and were literally tripping over each other). The location is great. The problems we encountered have more to do with service and organization among the staff. I made reservations for connecting rooms with double beds since we were traveling with our three children and my mother, the day we were to arrive I called to confirm, the front desk person told me that the connecting rooms had already been blocked for us. When we arrived late at night after a long day of travel we check-in and at check-in I remind the front desk person about our rooms, she said that we did have connecting rooms. We lug our stuff and kids to the rooms and they are not connecting. We go back to the front desk and the front desk person says that they show them as connecting (even though they are not) and appologizes and tries to find connecting rooms. She is not able to and informs us that those are the only rooms available for that night, but that she can move us to connecting rooms for the four remaining nights. So, we have no choice but to stay in the rooms since it was almost 1AM. It was hard with three young children and I'm sure we drove the neighbors crazy going back and forth between rooms that night trying to get exhausted, cranky kids settled and the following morning trying to get them ready. The following day we go to the front desk to change rooms and the front desk person says that there has been a mistake and that the rooms are not going to be available the last night of our stay because that entire wing of the hotel is going to have no electricity and there are not connecting rooms in the part of the hotel that is remaining open and that she does not know why the person the night before failed to remember that. So, we take the rooms since we have already wasted a good portion of our first day in New Orleans checking in with the hotel to see of the new rooms were ready and then moving our stuff. The front desk also told us that the new rooms were on the opposite side of the hotel, but that there was a hall that connected the wings on the 10th floor. She failed to mention that there were four steps to get up to the connecting hall and four steps on the other side. It was extremely hard to go up and down those stairs with children and luggage (even though all our luggage had wheels) but we were already so far from the elevators and so close to the other rooms. I also had to spend a good deal of my vacation time calling other hotels trying to find connecting rooms for our last night. I did find them and had a wonderful stay at the Chateau Sonesta (which is THE place to stay if you have kids with you or just enjoy LARGE rooms.) So, even though the hotel is lovely and the tiny rooms might be just the thing for a couple wanting to be close, it is not the place for families and the hotel can work on it's organization/knowledge. ',POOR,
'Wonderful Hotel! From the moment we walked into this lovely Hotel, we knew we had booked the right one. The lobby is breathtaking, with it's painted ceilings and ornate wood work. The staff was always helpful and available. The rooms were very clean and the maid service perfect. The rooftop pool was a wonderful treat and the fitness center had great equipment. This Hotel is close to everything! It was very easy to walk any place in the French Quarter. We had a deluxe room which offers a view of the French Quarter or Mississippi. I recommend the Mississippi view. I was told that the deluxe rooms are a little bigger than the regular rooms. I recommend the deluxe rooms. When we visit New Orleans again, we will always stay at the Hotel Monteleone! ',GOOD,
'The Monteleone, fantastic! I wanted to share New Orleans with my 13-year old as I love that city. After researching several French Quarter establishments, I decided on the Monteleone as I had not stayed there before. Check in and out was wonderfully simple and everyone was so pleasant. They even have a Grey Line Tour desk there which helped us a lot! My son loved the rooftop pool and exercise room, which we took advantage of everyday that we stayed there. The only negative was the steep rate for parking as we drove. The rooms were beautiful and we asked for and got a great view on the 14th floor. ',GOOD,
'Started off bad, got better We booked an air/hotel deal through travelocity for a 5 night, 6 day stay at the Monteleone. We arrived on July 4th at about 12:30 am. We got our luggage up the small flight of steps into the lobby, while the bell hop sat and chatted with another employee. Only when we got to the front desk did he offer to help us with our bags. We were told that they did not have the double double we had reserved, they only had a room with one king size bed, but with a great view. This did not work for us as there were three adults in our party. When we asked for a rollaway we were told there were none available. After arguing with the front desk clerk and night manager for about 15 minutes, we finally went up to the room and my husband slept on the floor. We were quite put out by the whole experience because the front desk clerk was really snooty about the whole thing. She basically told us that when you book through a third party there is no room guarantee, you get whatever they have available on the night you show up. We had the entire 5 page printout with us from travelocity and asked her to show us where it said that among the many disclaimers that were printed on it. She glanced through it for a couple minutes and then basically said it didn't really matter, they didn't have the room anyway. She did offer the put a block on a double double room, so we could move into it the next night as soon as it became available. The great view was of the rooftop of the parking garage. The next day we requested a move to the room we had originally booked and we were accomodated. We were also given a coupon for free breakfast at the hotel's restaurant to make up for our inconvenience. Other than that things improved. We thought the rooms were of adequate size and clean. The hotel staff were pleasant and friendly and the concierge made reservations for us at NOLA. The bar was great, not too crowded, and the bartenders were friendly and competent. The breakfast buffet was good in the hotel's restaurant. Mr. B's Bistro (one of the Brennan restaurants) is right across the street, and we had an excellent meal there. ',POOR,
'Loved the Monteleone, but encountered some issues!! My friends and I stayed at the Monteleone during the Essence Festival last year. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel, although the first room we were in was small, but we were moved to a bigger room. The hotel workers were very kind and helpful and did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable. Our main issue was being scammed by a so-called friend that we met the year before, so be careful, especially when it comes to the cab/hotel fees. Overall my friends and I enjoyed ourselves despite some of the issues we've encountered. This hotel is in the perfect location to everything (i.e., Bourbon St., Walgreens, police dept, ect.). Also, we would recommend that you eat breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, instead of ordering room service because it's a lot cheaper. We would visit the Monteleone again. ',GOOD,
'Perfect Location - Tiny Room! As previously stated many times on this website, the location is perfect, just one block from Bourbon Street. The rooms however were so small it was almost depressing. The beds however were extremely comfortable. The noisy construction woke me up every morning. Be aware of the doorman trying to trick you into getting a taxi to the airport when it's typically cheaper to get the shuttle. ',POOR,
'Incredible Location BUT... I stayed at the Hotel Monteleone with two friends for a conference and sight seeing. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful especially the huge grandfather clock at the center of the lobby (great picture spot!). You cannot get a better location in N.O.!! It's in walking distance of everything!! BUT we encountered some specific problems with the hotel service. The first night we were there, my friend noticed a permanent brown stain on the pillow case so she turned it over. The next night we had a pillow fight and as she lifted her pillow the SAME stain was still there! I guess they did not change our sheets. The next problem occured with the doorman. When we arrived to N.O. we scheduled  paid for the airport shuttle on the day of departure. The day we were leaving, the doorman said that we had no reservations for a shuttle, but he can hook us up with his taxi driver buddy. We kindly thanked him and asked for our shuttle since we already paid for it and it was much cheaper, but all of a sudden he starts to argue with us and begins to yell at one of my friends. Within 5 min. we had a full blown argument on the curb in front of everyone, he threw the reservation tickets at my friend, and with anger he allowed us to get into the shuttle, while he removed people that did not have reservations. Overall, it's a great hotel, but stay away from the hotel workers!!!!!!!!! ',POOR,
'Take the Good With the Bad We booked under the special summer rate of $88, which already had us really excited. The location was excellent...within walking distance of many attractions. The original room we were given, room 534 (BEWARE any rooms that end in 34, or are on a corner) was WAY too small. You could not open the armoire and walk by the bed, nor could you get into the closet with someone standing near you...and the bottom armoire drawers had to be perpetually opened, because the bed was in the way! Also, the bathroom was extremely cramped, and the knob for the shower kept popping off. WELL, THAT WASN'T THE WORST OF IT. At 6:30AM, construction was started outside (I think they were pressure washing the building) and did not stop until 8:00AM. We had a wonderful view of the rooftop of the buildings nearby (awful!) as well as the side of the Bienville side of the Hotel (even worse). We did bring this to the hotel's attention, and surprinsgly, we were moved to the 14th floor, and to a much more spacious room (through a tiny gap in the scaffolding, we could see the Mississippi). At that point, our feelings about the hotel were changed, even though we felt slighted the first night we were there. Front desk service was good, the concierge was helpful, and the overall experience, apart from the first night, was about par for what we expected from New Orleans. ',POOR,
'French Quarter Perfection Our seventh anniversary trip to NO, but our first stay at the Monteleone. We shopped as usual for a deal and the BB special at $129 including full American breakfasts for two reeled us in. We expected sort of bargain accomodations-WRONG! Our room was beautiful, service excellent, terrific view of the French Quarter,and every staff member made us feel that making our stay enjoyable was their top priority. The gravy on the breakfast buffet was the best ever BAR NONE and the location could not have been better. Looking forward to our next stay at this wonderful hotel. ',GOOD,
'LOVED this hotel We stayed at this hotel on May 10, 2004. It was beautifuly decorated, clean and the staff was wonderful. I felt very safe in this area of the quarter and if I came back to N.O. this would be the only place I would stay. ',GOOD,
'The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! I would go there again and again and again. The beds are the best, the view is wonderful, and the location is great. Royal Street is wonderful to take a stroll. You are in the heart of the French Quarter and everything that you would want to enjoy about the Big Easy is at your fingertips. ',GOOD,
'Pretty good but a few caveats Had I not just stayed at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon St., I'd rate the Monteleone higher. However, I cannot help but compare the 2 hotels, being located only a block and half apart. What's good about the Monteleone is the renovated, albeit small bathroom (no counter space to spread out my toiletries); the tap water doesn't leave your hands slimy after you've washed them; comfy bed w/ turndown service and mint chocolates. And of course, the revolving Carousel Bar is a cool hangout. Here's where it goes a bit awry: street noise and constant garbage truck collection impedes your sleep and serenity; static-ridden clock radio that grates on your ears (I ended up turning it off); no newspaper on your door (you have to walk across the street to buy it yourself?!?); inefficient elevator service. If I was staying here more than just the 2 nights, I'd have asked to change my room to a quieter side. The Monteleone is a very nice hotel, but it is not the ne ultra plus in plush comfort. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful, elegant hotel Wasn't sure what to expect from the 50th ranked hotel in NOLA and because of a few of the reviews here. Worried it would be tiny rooms, noisy and rude staff. WOW! Couldn't have been better. The room was number 1432, had a view of the bend of the river, the most comfortable king bed I have ever slept upon, was just big enough for two people and we had very little noise from the outside. Housekeeping was fantastic. Not bothersome (would let us sleep in) and kept a very clean room. In fact, the staff appeared very concerned to not make too much noise. Very nice! The bathroom was beautiful marble and extra clean.The hotel lobby (classic and beautiful) and staff (from the doormen to the desk clerks) was top class and refined. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The carousel bar was great, albeit, this is my one complaint. The posted bar times are from 10:00a.m. ... 'til. Well 'til seemed to be 1:30 a.m. every night regardless of how full the bar was. (not much of a complaint, but the only one I can come up with.) Lastly, talk about location. It was great! Location, location and location. Can't think of anywhere that wasn't within a good stretch of the legs. Bourbon St. being one block over was great for access and lack of noise. Acme Oysters, Felix, Dickie Brennans, Arnaud's, Louis XVI's, NOLA, Napoleon House, Johnny's, etc., etc., all right close, as was the Canal St. trolly....We'll definitely be staying there again and again!

'The only place to stay! I've stay at the Monteleone every year during my vacation. I find this hotel to be the nicest place to stay. The staff are professional and helpful. ',GOOD,
'I loved it ! I recently stayed at the Monteleone during Mardi Gras. I loved it ! What a wonderful hotel. The lobby is fantastic and so is the Carosel Bar. The restuarant was great with a super and fairly priced breakfast buffet. The staff were awesome ! My room was a small standard double on the 5th floor. The decor was superb and the bed fabulous. Great sheets and super comfortable. The bathroom was marble and granite and spotless. The maid service could not have been better. The room was clean and very comfortable. Sure it was small but for me just fine. I loved the hotel, the staff were fantastic and the rooms great. I woul not consider staying anywhere else and I am already planning my next trip. Give them a try you will be impressed ! ',GOOD,
'Great Atmosphere Small Cozy Rooms. Nice friendly, helpful staff.Will come back again. Was in town for the races. ',GOOD,
'a pleasant hotel in a fine location We we were there in January 2004. Outside room facing the river was of decent size and comfortable. Breakfast in their cafe was good and at an average hotel price. My understanding is that inner rooms (close upon other buildings or walls) are less pleasant. Concierge eager to please and competent. Well-located in French quarter, only a few blocks in from Canal and in easy walking distance of good restaurants, museums, etcetera. Would gladly return. Paid $160 per night. ',GOOD,
'Small room, Dirty bathroom, Slow Elevator, Very Noisy I stayed at this hotel from December 31, 2003 to January 3, 2004. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever been in. The tv armoire at the end of the bed was so close, you had to turn sideways to walk inbetween them to get to the closet. We had a lovely view of the Quarter and the river but also of the ongoing constuction. The bathroom was dirty, we had to clean the light switch which was covered with a yellow film and the sides of the toilet appeared to have never seen a scrub brush. I have given this hotel an OK rating only for the quickness of checkin, the location and the extremely helpful concierge. While the lobby was lovely, the elevators were the slowest in the world. The roof top pool was nice as well as the panoramic views of the Quarter. I would not stay here again or recommend the hotel. Nice to visit, but too small and noisy for comfort. ',POOR,
'World's smallest rooms, but one of the nicest staffs I am perplexed by the reviews about this hotel. I am an avid reader of this website and was staying at this hotel for a convention. The reviews have been so mixed I was unsure of what I was going to be in for. After a 5 day stay I have to say it is mixed, although I feel disappointed overall. My friends were staying at Loft 523 and had a terrific room - their bathroom was bigger than my entire room. The room itself is pathetic - unbelievable small. That is not an understatement - it was the smallest room I believed I have ever stayed at! You had to walk sideways to get between the bed and the TV stand. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was adequate, but the room is so depressing to walk into to. The closet is also very small with no room for much. Construction is going on all over the hotel as well (should be done by Feb 2004) and noise and inconvenience abound well into the night. Elevators are tediously slow as well. Positives include the people - everyone I encountered from doorman to receptionist to concierge were very friendly and helpful. The location is great, but it is not worth the money - my aforementioned friends were staying at Loft 523 - not a 5 minute walk with a beautifal room for 50 dollars less per night. Everything in New Orleans is within walking distance, so it is not worth it to pay so much for actually staying IN the French Quarter. ',POOR,
'The Only Hotel You Should Stay At!! Where do I begin? I planned our week-long, Thanksgiving, mom-and-dad-only vacation over 4 months ago. When doing my research, I decided on the Monteleone. I could have never chosen a better hotel! It was way more than I could have ever expected. I didn't grasp what the other reviewers were truly staying until I got there. Just looking at the outside of the hotel gives you goosebumps. By the way, the door men's names are Stefan (the best), Darrel, (good) and David (terrific). They will get you anything or get you to anywhere you want to go. Just remember, when tipping, $1 for each bag of luggage they move, $3 if they hail you a taxi and $2 for tourist information. It's the polite thing to do. Same tipping rules go for the baggage check people and the bell hops. The lobby/reception area of the hotel is beautiful. A little more mute than I expected but grand. They have construction going on in parts of the hotel but we never heard or saw a thing. We stayed in room 1048 and while the rooms are a little small, we didn't go on vacation to spend all the time in the room. The beds are magnificent!!!!!! They are sooooo comfortable and the pillows are overstuffed with down!! The bathroom walls, floor, sink and tub were all made of marble. The shower heads and water pressure are absolutely the best!!!! There are mirrors everywhere in the bathroom. They give you not only shampoo and conditioner, but an unscented glycerine bar for your face and an oatmeal bar for your bath, instead of the cheap, wafer thin soap bars you get everywhere else. They do provide hairdryers but they are not very good. But, what they do provide that is good is the coffee!!!! They give you both a package of decaf and regular Chez Parisien coffee each day. C'etait magnifique!! They only give you one sugar, creamer and SweetNLow for two people but you can always request more coffee, creamers, sugars, ice etc. and they will bring it right to you. The only problem we found with that is the only working ice machine on our side of the hotel was on the 15th floor, so if you called for ice, it took them 30 minutes to bring it to you. I suggest you take the elevators and go get it yourself so it only takes 2 minutes. Speaking of the elevators, I hope you don't get queasy. They go extremely fast but they don't make you feel like you are going to wind up on your butt. The hangers in the closet are real, mahogany stained wood. They only gave us a dozen but we requested more and they brought us a dozen more wire hangers. The only REAL drawback to our hotel was that everything costs. The high speed internet access in our room was an etherport, which we didn't have, and it costs 5.95 per hour or 9.95 a day. The internet access on the tv costs 19.95 for a day and you can't access your emails with it. You get about 25 top channels for free but if you want to go outside of that, you have to pay by the event. Our view was decent. The Quarter is all crammed in with buildings everywhere so if you see rooftops, consider yourself lucky you got a view. The curtains were nice and heavy so I could shut them and still pretend it was dark outside so I could sleep in late. =) Because it is on Royal St, it has IMMEDIATE access to everything. Walgreens is downstairs on the left corner. TGIFriday's is on the left-south corner. Mr. B's Bistro is on the right corner and McDonald's, New Orleans Praline Shop, Bourbon St., Brennan's, the Police Station and a million other things are all within 25 steps or so. Le Cafe inside the Monteleone serves an EXCELLENT and EXTENSIVE breakfast and lunch buffet for a reasonable New Orleans price. The Hunt Room Grill is pricey but the food is good. The Aft Deck Oyster Bar inside the hotel was ridiculous. It is overpriced, nasty, skimpy on the portions and the staff is slow. The Carousel Bar offers decently priced drinks. Take a camera and go up to the Riverview Roof and take pictures of the entire city. The pool is small but we didn't go there to swim. We can swim anywhere we go. The fitness room is pretty good to. And free. They also give you an iron and an ironing board. You must get the turn-down service!!! They come in in the evening, turn down your sheets, place a card on your bed with the next day's forecast on it and place chocolates on your bed!! It a real treat!! Beware of the toilets. If you have to go potty in the night, be courteous to your mate and don't flush it until the morning!! The water pressure is so great, it sounds like a hurricane in the potty!! LOL There is an ATM in the lobby but it costs $3 to use. So, we went next door to Walgreen's, developed our film, used our debit card to pay and got cash back that way. We didn't use the concierge service while there because we know NOLA already. When we checked in, I asked for the highest up room we could get. We then checked our bags and went for lunch. When we came back, I asked what view we got and she said an alley. I told her that I asked for the highest room up and IMMEDIATELY she upgraded us and moved us up higher and to a nicer room. Something to think about. If you want to ask me any specific questions, email me. I'll be happy to share info with you. Have a great vacation!! ',GOOD,
'Nice hotel, thin wallsw Stayed here Thanksgiving night of 2003. Beautiful hotel with nice vintage architecture and decoration. Room was slightly small and quaint but cozy. The downfall is the thin walls in the guest room that do much of nothing when it comes to noise. We heard the people in the room next to us and could understand their conversations, what they were watching on tv, and anything else you care to imagine. We would have been satisfied with some type of exhaust fan in the bathroom to create some white noise to drown out some of the racket, but there was none. In short, nice hotel, great location, just dont go to sleep early. ',POOR,
'Historic hotel, convenient location The Monteleone Hotel was started in 1886 and is still run by the same family. It is a high rise with charm in the French Quarter a block from Bourbon and a block from the business district. We had fabulous views including the River from our 11th story mini suite. (Be sure to ask for view room). Staff is gracious, decor is beautiful and the Carousel Bar is a tradition. One of three Literary Landmark hotels in the country because of writers like Tennessee Williams, Faulkner, Capote and Hemmingway who stayed there. ',GOOD,
'Terrible customer service - do not stay at the Monteleone Do NOT stay at the Hotel Monteleone. It's the absolutely worst customer service I have every experienced in my travels. I travel for a living and have stayed all over the world. I have never had to deal with such poor customer service.I was charged incorrectly on my credit card and management does not return calls or offer to correct the problem. I was basically told I was not telling the truth when multiple individuals on staff confirmed everything with me before I checked out.Also, when we asked questions at the front desk on how to find things we were told I don't know. On two separate incidents we had room requests that were never delivered and there was so much confusion on our reservations we spent majority of our stay waking up to the maid pounding on our door or trying to straighten out or checkout with the front desk. Nobody could seem to figure things out. We paid for it when we got home - with a higher bill than we were told when we checked out.DO NOT stay at this hotel! You go to New Orleans to have fun and relax and should not have to deal with poor service at your hotel. ',POOR,
'Charming Monteleone Just returned from my second stay at the Hotel Monteleone. The hotel room was on the small size, but well appointed. Very comfortable bed. Bathroom was clean and updated. They are adding high-speed internet access to all rooms. I thought I would see an extra charge on my bill for using high-speed access, but there was none. Location in the heart of the French quarter makes for easy access to great restaurants. Their garage also makes for easy coming and going. Very helpful concierge. A great stay in a fun city! ',GOOD,
'Great bed, shower,  Went for the King Premier. Absolutely awesome bed in all respects. The only thing better than the bed was the shower - best water pressure ever.Staff was wonderful all-around. While the South is definately so much more friendlier than my wedgied Northeast, the Monteleone went beyond even normal Southern Hospitality.Great bar, and nice rooftop pool area for lounging.On the blah side, the room was small, but it didn't matter, as we were hardly there. Noisy, especially from the street, but we knew what we were getting into being a block over from Bourbon. Plus the strains of the Sanford and Son Theme coming from the street being played on trumpet for three nights in a row at 2 AM kind of became our song. Call us romantics.While a tad pricey, it wasn't at all unreasonable. We will go back. ',GOOD,
'French Quarter Accommodations I would recommend the Monteleone Hotel to anyone wanting to be in the heart of the French Quarter. Drive right up to the parking garage and turn your keys over to the attendant.The pool is on the roof (16 floors up) where you can catch magnificent views of the city (great pictures). Close-by is the Mississippi River, and New Orleans is the busiest port in the United States.Located on the ground floor are boutiques, Le Cafe cafe, an Oyster Bar and the Carousel Bar, where you can enjoy cocktails as you slowly glide around the bar at your barstool.The hotel prices vary during the season, but usually in mid-summer, the rates are approximately $90.00 per night (during the week). There is a slight increase for Fridays and Saturdays.The next street over is the world-famous Bourbon Street. We walk everywhere from our Hotel. Excellent shopping on Canal Street and at the Riverwalk.I highly recommend this Hotel. ',GOOD,
'You cant survive on reputation alone What a dissapointment!!!!!! Very small room with view of the A/C unit. Service in the restaurant was non existent . From there to the maid staff, nobody seemed to care if you were happy or not. One elevator in our wing worked . Three days spent waiting 10 -15 minutes for elevator. Service in bar was as bad as the restuarant. Asked to speak to Gen Mgr . Left message twice and never heard from him. Front desk lost package sent by Fed Ex. Asked three times for it and never did get it. If they are going off of their reputation, then they need to work on service big time. I am seasoned business traveler and have come to expect less than promised, I NEVER Complain.. I will not return for 150.00 per night to be aggrivated. Laquinta , here I come!!!! ',POOR,
'Hotel Monteleone --Great!! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monteleone for one night on July 31, 2003. Our room was on the third floor and was very clean and comfortable. There were plenty of towels, the water pressure in the shower was great, and we never ran out of hot water. There was a even a Walgreens downstairs right on the corner for the little things we forgot. There are little 4 cup coffee makers in the room if you are like me and need a little coffee first thing in the morning before you face the world. The room decor was pretty with yellow and white striped wallpaper and the bed was really comfortable with feather pillows and triple sheeting (one sheet, one velour blanket, one sheet). A couple of things to be aware of when staying at the Hotel Moteleone is: the parking is $19 per day (most hotels in New Orleans charge for parking anyway), the rooms are on the small size (completely fine for my husband and I, but I would make sure it is going to be big enough for you if you are traveling with children), and the walls are thin and the street noise carries into the room a bit as well (we wear earplugs while we sleep and had no problem). Those are the only possible downsides that I noticed while we were there, hope this helps!! ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel Great hotel central to most tourist sites. Easy walk for 2 blocks to bus transportation. 2 blocks from Bourbon St. Good restaurants for that quick meal but great hotels in immediate area. Roof top pool is great way to end the day-sun was very hot even at 4:00 PM. My room was spacious and well appointed. Very, very clean. They have one of the best concierge services I have encountered. I was traveling alone and their advice re. tours, restaurants, walking directions was excellent. I would definitely recommend or stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Pass The Airsickness Bag My friend and I ate at the hotel restaurant. Her crawfish meal tasted of freezer burn and the dressing tasted like it came from a cardboard box (or was the box). I sent it back and ordered a shrimp plate to replace it. The shrimp arrived in early stages of decomposition. I sent it back and asked for the bill and the manager. The waitress was surly and the manager was clueless. I promised to call the health department if she got sick.The evening, of course was ruined. Not an apology in the entire affair.It was my worst dining experience in 25 years of business travel. BAR NONE.STAY AWAY !! ',POOR,
'Way above average! We had an excellent room, excellent service, staff were immaculate and happy. Breakfasts were tasty and well served. All in all a great experience. ',GOOD,
'Great location - Great rooms - Bad concierge We stayed for two nights in May of 2003. The hotel is beautiful and you can't beat the location - close enough to Bourbon to enjoy the decadence but not noisy at night! Also, Royale street is full of wonderful antique shops. Close to everything! The rooms were great - we stayed in the older section but it had modern appliances and GREAT beds. The pool is beautiful and the lobby bar features a revolving bar - check it out! Yes, the rooms were a bit on the small side but we had four adults and were fine - we didn't go to the French Quarter to hang out in the rooms! Overall, a very impressive hotel - we will definitely be back!One bad note - the concierge sucks. Appears to have no knowledge of New Orleans and did nothing except hand us some brochures. You're much better off talking to the doorman or one of the local shop owners - they are much more helpful! ',GOOD,
'Paper thin doors The food was excellent and so was the service, but he door of our room was paper thin. So, we were kept awake all night by some rather loud collegiate types across the hall. ',POOR,
'Excellent Bed We stayed at the Hotel Monteleone about a week before Mardi Gras. We chose Hotel Monteleone because it was reputed to be an upscale hotel and because of its location. It is about less than a block away from Bourbon Street. There are also many good restaurants not too far from the hotel. We even walked to the Aquarium, which is about 6 blocks away. The rooms were a little small and we only had a view of the alley, but the beds were just fabulous! I would compare their beds to the Heavenly Beds at the W hotels! Needless, to say, I slept very well. However, their customer service, with the exception of the doormen (who were so helpful), was not very good. Their maid service was extremely loud, yelling and joking with each other from across the hall at 8:00 a.m! The Concierge was also very abrupt and seemed too busy to help. Overall, the hotel is ideal if you're looking for close proximity to all of the fun. Still, the hotel needs to give their employees more training in customer service, which I believe is a staple in upscale hotels. ',POOR,

'Enjoyed the Fairmont Olympic I booked a sport event special price and let them know I was celebrating my birthday with this trip. Staff/Service was outstanding. They remembered my birthday and honored all requests. Room service was overpriced, but again the service was outstanding and the food was excellent. Room was comfortable, a little on the plain side, but roomy and amply and elegantly furnished. Lobby was beautiful, but entrances were confusing. Airport shuttle bus pickup spot was moved from the Fairmont to several blocks away and had to haul my suitcase through the snow. (Unusual storm for the area really wreaked havoc.) Missed the first bus as it did not stop where the concierge told me it would stop. I blame that on the shuttle company, but then a 5 diamond might offer airport shuttle...and the concierge was very hard to reach in the morning. Short staffed due to storm? Toilet seat on crooked. Overall I had a very nice birthday stay and for a similar price, would stay there again. Very good downtown location and great amenities. I enjoyed the atmosphere and appreciate their reaching out to several types of guests. ',GOOD,
'Historical hotel with old world flair, top notch staff. We booked with Fairmont website as they advertised the rate of $150.00 US per night, which for this grand old hotel was a very good rate over the Thanksgiving weekend.Even though the main entrance is located on the street level you need to take either the escalator or elevator up to the check in lobby/desk. Check in was quick and accurate. My special request to have a small extra fridge and a inroom coffee maker was honoured without charge, a hotel perk. Check out was just as easy with no surprise charges or special fees on the bill.Parking is not within the hotel but across the street behind the hotel or you can have valet parking for 32.00 per night. **TIP** Street parking is free in the evening as we parked our car right in front of the hotel for 2 nights.The room offered plenty of space and light. You can open your window (1 foot) to get some fresh air. Fairmont hotels offer green choices including a recycle waste basket. The only downside to our stay was the beds which were old, soft and saggy and the old clunky television. The washrooms were well appointed with an excellent showerhead power. The towels were in good quality and soft as were the robes and slippers.The gym is an oasis with cozy change rooms and lockers. They offer a large jacuzzi but a small pool with a lane open for lap swimming. The pool was quiet at night with a glass roof and the low lights made for a relaxing swim. The gym has 2 areas one for weights and the other for aerobics equipment (bike, treadmills etc) The bikes and treadmills had individual tv's and 2 staff members available all times. The stars of this hotel should be noted, the top notch proffesional staff and EVERY single time we had a conversation with them (reservation, room service, front desk, housekeeping, gym and others) they smiled and said Would there be anything else we can do for you? The staff are well trained in guest services.The hotel is located in the hub of downtown Seattle in a safe area to walk around. Many nooks and crannies to explore in this architecture delight. If the rate is right we would return but would like to see them replace the beds and tv. ',GOOD,
'Fabulous Hotel!!! I stayed at the Fairmont Olympic in late September 2008 for work and I am now a customer for life. My room was spacious, beautifully decorated and spotless, exactly what I expect from the Fairmont. The turndown service every night was a plus. I used the gym every morning at 5:15 (it opens at 5) and they have a nice selection of machines - I really liked having my own tv and headphones on the treadmill. There were quite a few of us staying at the hotel and I never once had to wait for an elevator. The Fairmont catered many of our functions and the food was fantastic. The staff was gracious and always glad to see me. Great location as well, easy to walk to pretty much anything. I was really sad to leave! ',GOOD,
'OMG this place needs to be updated in their rooms i booked the night before Friday October 11th 2008 after 6:20pm pacific time on Hotels.caI've used Hotels.ca lots for Florida and always got lucky with last minute lowest rates.we got it for $239 canadian taxes included. We were coming from Vancouver Canada by car.The Valet service is the best, its true what they say about these guys. The whole experience per say with service was unbeleiveable. This staff is teh best i've come across. If it wasn't for the suites and rooms needing a total new uplift, i would have gien this hotel a 6 Star rating.We were upgraded from a executive suite to a Deluxe Executive suite. Holy S***!, huge room with a living room and big bathroom. This place is extremely clean. Probably the cleanest hotel and its rooms that i have ever saw.The problem is the furniture is so old, something you would see maybe at a second hand antique store or Sally ann store, but in good shape. Saddly the carpets had slight ripple and was not in style.. I found everything to be in the 80's style with the furniture being early 70's. The bath tub is the lowest i have saw.. Really , its so low don't expect a deep soaker tub which i would have expected from this hotel. The toilet was so low to the ground, i needed a handle which wasn;t provided. I'am in my late 30's , great shape and found an inconvenience. I feel really bad the decor is mostly suited for those over 70 years old but lack handicap accessories found in European and Canadian Hotels.Yes you do get CBC from Canada on the old 26 inch panasonic tv, but the picture quality is less than digital with fuzz snow in every channel.The hide-a-bed in the sofa had a sink in the middle. Our teenagers complain of this. Our king size Mattress was so stiff, i kept twisting and turning all night. Everything felt and smelled clean. But the bed, the curtains(GOD UGLY), old tv sets, toilet, bathtub, carpets, french doors, thermostat all need to be modernized and improved to a high standard.The door knobs where worn off from the brass, the french doors had no glass, just see thru curtains from the seating room to the bedroom.as to the noise, I was on the 10th floor. I could hear all the traffic outside and someone yelling on the street. Its true , there is no view anywhere in this building. You are surrounded by newly built highrises way taller than 12 stories..lolas to distance to the shopping district and Pike Market where they throw the salmon. You are really close but far away from teh crowds. about a 15 minute walk. I was thinking before booking Fairmount Olympic Hotel to book the Sheraton. But the Sheraton and Westin in Florida really suck and over price for the dumps they own! BUt seeing the Sheraton, I would definitely book the Sheraton. It looks newer, beautifully decorated, really what a new hotel should look like and lots of stagette parties. Convenently located to everything and priced moderately. next time, it will be the Sheraton or the Pan Pacific.by the way valet parking in Seattle is $30 , at the Fairmount its $35. beleive it or not , its much cheaper to the the valet than using the public pay parking where they charge you $11 for a 90 minutes parking.Also everything is Seattle is overpriced to any other big city. It has no real good restaurants and all are over-rated and overpriced. But We did enjoy the TapHouse. Seattle is the most unfriendly City and a dunGY ugly city. I take cruises every year or Royal carribean and Princess and travel to many huge metropolitan cities. Seattle is the bottom of the list for restaurants and thinsg to do.IF your on a budget but still want a nice place, but don't want to pay a fortune but still stay close to Seattle. I would recommend anything in Everett washington that is close to Seattle. a few minutes on the I-5 interstate. Honestly!if you like my post.. please score me. ',GOOD,
'Excellent! Wedding Bliss鈥?My good friend got married in June. The reception and overnight guests were booked at the Arctic Club, a new hotel in Seattle. The Arctic Club was not ready to open in time for the reception so they moved us all to the Fairmount. What a treat!! The building was just beautiful, and well maintained. The rooms were small suites with a nice sitting area with a couch, 2 chairs, desk/chair (with a recycle bin, only in Seattle), TV, large closet and dresser. A separate bedroom was equipped with a king size bed, TV, and bathroom. We got to use terrycloth robes, and slippers, and expensive toiletries. I loved the lobby lounge, where we were able to sip on cocktails, munch on appetizers, and listen to the pianist tap out perfect tunes to make you feel like you鈥檝e stepped back in time. I have never had the opportunity to stay in such a historical hotel, and would definitely do it again.One last thing I would like to point out. The lobby was beautifully decorated with large bouquets of live flowers, one huge one in the middle. Unfortunately, I am severely allergic to Tiger Lily鈥檚 (one of my favorite flowers) and the huge bouquet in the middle of the room was filled with them. As I was waiting to check-in my throat began to swell. I was 4th in line to check-in, and knew that would be too long, so I snuck around to the VIP check-in (separate area) and explained my situation to the gentlemen who was happy to assist me there and quickly checked me into my room. What Service!!! ',GOOD,

'Honeymoon Night Splurge We live in Seattle and booked the Fairmont Olympic for our honeymoon night. We booked a King Suite as we wanted enough space for our wedding party to hang out and get ready prior to our ceremony. We called the hotel directly to book and were given a modest AAA discounted rate as members. Upon booking, we advised we were staying for our wedding night and would like an early check-in if possible. The person who booked our room was very polite and professional. He noted that we were booking the only 5-star rated hotel in the Seattle area.Check-in was okay. The person behind the counter was a little robotic with the Welcome to the Fairmont script and there was no acknowledgment that we were there for our wedding, which I guess we sort-of expected given the fanciness of the hotel and having given this information upon booking. We were given an early check-in without any hassle however.Our room was spacious with a bedroom and separate living area that had a couch, chair and coffee table. The decor is okay. It keeps with the old style of the hotel but we were expecting some more modern touches such as a flat-screen TV vs. the old one in the room (not that we watched any TV on our wedding night - just an observation!). The bathroom sink and faucets could be a bit nicer. The bed was comfy but not as good as some of the beds at nicer Hiltons where we've stayed in the past. The shower was very nice.The hotel did deliver a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries with a 'Congratulations' acknowledgment of our marriage. The valet parking also left us cookies  milk when we departed in the morning. Both were nice touches. After taxes and valet parking charges, we paid a little over $400 for our night's stay. In all, our stay was nice but we did not feel overly pampered or treated like royalty which, at $400/night, one might expect to a small degree. ',GOOD,
'Great Upscale Hotel We had a great stay at this upscale hotel. We stayed for a wedding held in the hotel and the staff was extremely attentive. The room was clean and the wonderful comfortable bedding made the stay excellent. We ordered room service the night we arrived and it was promptly served and was delicious. The hotel is in a good location and the area is pleasant to walk to many of the sites. We were happy with our stay and would recommend it if anyone needs to stay in Seattle. ',GOOD,
'Nice to see how the other half lives :-) We are not Fairmont sort of people - we tend to fit in at the Comfort Inn  Suites - however we did decide to splurge for our last two nights in Seattle and stay at the Fairmont Olympic - and it was really lovely. The valet parking was efficient and friendly - those guys outside are the hotel's best ambassadors! The check in was efficient - and although the elevators are quite small as another person mentioned, they were really, really fast so our waits were not so bad.We had 3 meals in the Georgian - 2 breakfasts and 1 dinner.For breakfast - we would recommend the Banana  Strawberry French Toast - forget about the calories and order it - its an amazing dish. The dinner we had was probably the most elegant of any we have had - ever -- and we can't say how it would compare to other spendy restaurants, but we did enjoy it - and were made to feel very comfortable in their dining room.We had a suite on the 7th floor - no view, but when you look out the window you see hundreds of other rooms without a view, so you are not alone. The room was nicely decorated, spacey - especially the bathroom - and truly comfortable.Thanks to this hotel for having CBC available on their TV - we got to stay in touch with the Olympics while there, and didn't miss anything! The pool and fitness area is divine - and if we return, we will spend far more time there. We found Seattle to be a great shopping city - and within walking distance are some great shops - Coach, Nordstroms etc. We left our mark there too :-)My only niggle was room service - it wasn't so good. I ordered fish  chips and expected it to be the best fish  chips ever. It wasn't. It tasted like any old room service dish from any old Sheraton or Holiday Inn - and cost twice as much. For us, this was a treat - now we go back to our middle class lives and enjoy our memories. We'd love to do this again - and maybe we will someday! ',GOOD,
'A Bit Disappointed The Fairmont is a beautiful, older (but modernized) hotel in a prime Seattle location. The hotel is walking distance from most city sights, including the waterfront, aquarium, shopping, Market and many more. The lobby is old-style, large and comfortable, with oriental rugs, lots of wood, etc. Check-in was quick. Getting to the room -- not so quick. The hotel has four, quite small and quite slow elevators, one or more of which was almost always out of order in the two days we stayed there. Thus, at peak times such as mornings and dinner-time, there was a 5-10 minute wait. And, when the elevator finally did arrive, it was filled, because it only holds 5-6 people, without luggage. With luggage, it's crowded with 3.Our room was disappointing. Knowing that older hotels have a hodgepodge of rooms, many of which are smaller than modern hotels, I didn't expect much. Still the room was VERY small with no view. Queen bed. Only one chair -- thus, one of us had to sit on the bed to watch the very small TV. Of course, because the chair and bed were directly opposite (and the room was too small to move the chair next to the bed), we both could not watch TV at the same time w/o craning our necks. There was almost no place on the floor to put our suitcases and we ended up tripping over them.Room decor was ok -- not memorable -- and bed was comfortable. The A/C worked well and I believe there was a mini-bar (didn't use it). However, the room was so small that we didn't want to do anything there but sleep.The bathroom, by contrast, was a good size with lots of marble and nice amenities. Rooms were very well-insulated and there is an in-room safe. Wakeup call was timely and staff was very friendly. The concierge desk was well-manned and provided excellent suggestions.We tried the hotel restaurant for breakfast. The food was good and served fairly promptly. Cost was about what you'd expect for a high-end hotel. Workout room was modern and there was plenty of staff to assist.Overall, the stay was ok but, if coming again, for the same price I'd stay down the street at the Hotel Monaco or just try another hotel in the city.

'From a family with a toddler We just came back from one night here while stopping through Seattle. The price wasn't too bad with the AAA rate of $312/night, though for that price I have high expectations. First arriving, we were greeted by the valet attendants and these guys were all very friendly/helpful. They get 5 stars from me!!We didn't have to wait in line to check in, which was nice. However, the one negative for me was that they said our luggage would be right up and we were supposed to have a crib in our room since it was noted with our reservation and I called a week before to comfirm. The crib wasn't there so I called downstairs and they brought it up. The crib ended up looking very nice and we also got some baby toiletries with it. After waiting for our luggage 20 minutes, I called again and it was brought to our room. This normally isn't a big deal but we did have to wait for it for going out. The room we were in on the fifth floor, 534 did look out with the pool right below us, so if possible, request something away from there.It had a suite with a tv, bedroom, large closet area and bathroom. Everything looked beautiful in marble, the hotel is beautiful too and fancy and is centrally located for the pike's place market (several blocks away walking). If you want to get to the seattle center you will have to take another mode of transportation, as it's too far to walk, but there is a bus stop and monorail stop a few blocks from the hotel.There is also a benihanna's on the next block, which I recommend. Our toddler loved it(: ',GOOD,
'Excellent Service This is a beautiful hotel with service you will not find elsewhere. My personal favorite is the way the bellmen welcome you back every time you leave and return to the hotel. It's such a nice gesture to say welcome back and always put a smile on my face. The Concierge was extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and handling the reservations. The room we had was a Deluxe King and I thought it was plenty big with a nice bathroom (although I would have preferred to have had a separate shower and bath instead of a bath/shower combination). The cleaning women cleaned the room very well each day and there is turndown service each night. Also each night they leave a card with the next day's weather forecast (which I found very helpful in planning the next day's wardrobe selection). In the morning, there is a newspaper delivered. There are no views from this hotel, but what you're paying for is the service. I would recommend the hotel to those who enjoy high quality service. ',GOOD,
'5 Stars I just arrived home from 5 days at the fairmont olympic hotel in seattle and i would have been content to move in their permanently! i was fortunate to be booked in on a convention rate ($250 per night--and they didn't have the basic room for 5 nights so for $25 more i had a suite!).....that is $25 well spent!! i had a huge king sized bed and a separate living room with sofa, 2 overstuffed pillows to rest my head after a day of shopping, a desk, chair and 2 tvs.....there is a separate dressing area and the bathroom was nice with 2 robes to use.....the hotel is first class all the way....the staff cannot do enough for you!! i had requested a coffee maker, which for some reason the fairmont does not provide.....when i checked in, there was no coffee maker in the room, so i phoned the front desk.....the head of catering told me that he would get one for me, even if he had to buy it himself.....sure enough, within 1/2 hour they brought me a coffee maker on a silver platter with all the acoutrements!! i was very impressed.....the doormen greet you when you leave the premises and when you return--a nice touch!! coffee and tea is served in the lobby in the early morning.....the carpet is starting to look a bit dated in the halls, but that would be my only complaint--and a small price to pay for a marvellous hotel.......i can't wait to stay on the gold floor on the fairmont in boston--where i am going in 1 week!!by the way, seattle is a great city for shopping! it is small--all of the shops are within a 2 block radius--macy's, nordstroms, brooks brothers, coach, yves st laurent, etc. etc.! heaven for this visitor from canada!

'A little bit disappointed Got an excellent deal thru Expedia on this hotel. Arrival: confusion, bellhop spoke broken english, they asked if we wanted them to take all our bags up to our room, it was confusing and awkward so we just did it ourselves. They didn't help us getting luggage loaded onto the carts. I think they should just do it, not ask! We had a lot of stuff. Check-in: smooth. No problems. Our room was near the health club though on the 2nd floor and there was a strong odor of chlorine. We asked to be moved immediately. Had to wait about 20 minutes for someone to show up and take us to the 4th floor. Our new room had view of the harbor (partial view). Room: Our AC didn't work properly. 1st night miserable. They offered to move us but they had someone try to fix it the 2nd day and it was a little better but still warm. We decided not to move. We had a nice king bed, very comfy, nice linens. Rug in the room and hallways needs replaced but we still went barefoot (it wasn't THAT bad!). Nice marble floors in bathroom, nice shower, granite countertops, nice magnifier mirror on the wall, a nice amenity! tip: bring your own shampoo  conditioner and soap. The hotel supplied products are pretty bad (cheap). ELEVATORS! Wow. Hope they have been repaired since we were there. The wait to go down took forever. We ended up using stairs most the time. Overall appearance the hotel is beautiful, lobby is beautiful, friendly staff. I thought complimentary coffee would be nice for the guests. There is no coffeemaker in the room. There is a nice coffee/espresso shop on the street level. They have fabulous looking sweets. Cappuccinos are delicious. Just wish we had coffee in the room. Room was quiet, no noise from neighbors, hall, just occasional street noise but we had our window open because the AC broke and we shut it off and opened the window. ',POOR,
'elegance and impeccable service!! I was a little worried having read some reviews before staying here. The hotel has some worn items, but the service and care of its staff more than compensated for any worn carpet I saw. My in-laws and I stayed here on the night of July 4th. We arrived around 9:30AM from our cruise ship and they let us check in at that very moment, no added fees. My mother-in-law and I took High Tea at the Georgian. It was excellent and we were not rushed, but were encouraged to linger. Upon check-in, we were given a little bag of toys (very cheap made in China), but a nice thought and a card to order complimentary cookies and milk from room service for our 2 year-old. Both rooms were huge!! Ours was so large, and allowed plenty of room for our portable crib. The draperies were a little dated, but lovely as they were trimmed with bullion fringe.We learned from an employee that the Georgian Room is about to be renovated-a shame, I liked the green upholstery. Everything is very elegantly decorated, but the bath faucets and fixtures show their age.The hotel was lovely, one of the finest that I have ever stayed in while in a large city. Some things are worn, but I am sure that renovations are soon to follow. Never once did I see anything dirty or grimy, everything was neat and clean in our room. My overall opinion of the Fairmont is a high opinion of a classic hotel that knows customer service and care. Try not to be in a rush, be nice to the staff (anywhere you go), even if it takes a little more time. Many of the Fairmont鈥檚 staff are international and are sincere about guests' concerns. I would jump at the chance to stay at the Fairmont again and am blessed to have gotten such a great room at such a great rate for this trip.TEA at the Georgian RoomOur waiter suggested I try the 1907 Fairmont blend tea-a wise decision. He was very nice and helpful. His name was Quoc (Asian guy). Another waiter was Alvis (Eastern European?) Both were humorous and answered any questions we had about the hotel or food, all-the-while remaining very professional. One could tell they enjoyed their work. The decor of the 2 chandeliers (8 feet high each), green furniture and creamy walls was soothing. It is not the fanciest hotel that I have taken tea in before, but the food was superb and again the wait staffs made it seem grander than the Palm Court Tea experience that I had in San Fran. The Wait staff was horribly snobbish there!At many other high teas I have had, the chef brings in certain finished pastries, etc. The waiters explained that the only items not made on the premises are bread and crackers. All pastries are made there and also supplied to their little patisserie.The food was great, but the service by our two waiters as mentioned above was probably the best service I have ever had in North America and Europe! ',GOOD,
'Significant deterioration... I stayed in this hotel many times back in the days when it was the Four Seasons Olympic. My spouse and I recently had the misfortune to stay there again under its new (Fairmont) sponsorship.We arrived around 10 pm only to find that the room we had booked through American Express (and gauranteed for late arrival!) had been given away to a guest who had arrived earlier. The desk clerk DOWNGRADED us at the same price we had paid for the superior room that he had given away earlier!We complained to American Express who apparently caused a stink with the asst. manager who grudgingly offered to move us to our original room the next day with a $30 credit for the night we arrived.We declined the asst, manager's offer because we didn't want to stay around to monitor our luggage during the move and we were staying for only 36 hours anyway. We took the credit instead for 2 nights. At our age and after all we've been through, we weren't keen to stay in a below-par room, credit or no credit, but there was nothing we could do without destroying our leisure time the next day!Apart from the bad check-in experience, contacting room service was difficult with many minutes spent on hold. Some more experienced staff would be in order... and fewer shyster practices!I've been traveling on business for over 40 years and so I know that hotels routinely give away their best rooms (even the GAURANTEED ONES!!!) if it appears that the guest may be a no-show. Knowing that we would be a late arrival, I deliberately chose the Fairmont based on my earlier experiences from when this hotel was under the Four Seasons banner.I'll never stay at the Fairmont again!! If we had want to subject ourselves to the shoddiest practices of the lodging industry we would have stayed at a cut price motel. At least they smile when they're ripping you off! ',POOR,
'Elegance at its finest       The hotel lobby ',GOOD,
'Stunningly Gorgeous! We've lived in the Seattle area all our lives and this hotel is an original classic I've always wanted to stay at. We finally splurged and spent a night here and it was perfect in every way! This is an old hotel but immaculent  pristine! The lobby area is gorgeous, with incredible, winding staircases to an upper loggia surrounding the lobby. The restaurant is gorgeous...the room was gorgeous and impeccably clean. The bed and linens were to die for! The service was outstanding. The location is perfect for getting anywhere around downtown. We travel constantly, and stay in Seattle an average of once every two weeks, so as an experienced traveler I can honestly say this hotel is perfection in all ways (well, unless you're looking for affordable :)We were actually in town to visit my father-in-law in the hospital, so we didn't really get to spend much time enjoying the hotel, but will get back to do so ASAP. I can't recommend the Fairmont Olympic enough! ',GOOD,
'A great stay! We had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont. The location and service are second to none. You are within walking distance to Pike's Place Market and many other great attractions in Seattle. The concierge staff can not do enough for you. The beautiful lobby is a great place to have a cocktail before heading out to dinner. The hotel restaurant, Shucker's, has excellent seafood, although it is pricey, it was wonderful.One of the best features is the health club and georgeous indoor pool.I did not find any of the issues other reviewers mentioned. Everything was just about perfect. But realize that you are not heading to a five-star Vegas property such as the Bellagio, or to a newer boutique hotel. You are taking a step back in time to a classic - a well-maintained and classically elegant hotel from a different era. With the right expectations in mind, you won't be disappointed.There is so much to see and do in Seattle and the Fairmont was a great place to stay. ',GOOD,
'A little rough around a few edges My family and I stayed in two connecting rooms on the 8th floor for two nights. One of the toilets didn't work and it took several calls to the maintenance department to get somebody to fix it. In the other room, one of the air conditioning vents made a loud whistling sound that never seemed to go away. (We wound up covering it with a pillow to block out the noise.) Some of the upholstery and drapes looked a little old and out of date. Having said that, our stay here was a pretty positive experience. The doormen's hospitality is legendary and has been noted here by a previous reviewer. For a Fairmont, the lobby is a little plain but it was certainly nice. We hired a car and driver through the concierge and that worked flawlessly. Several things that really stood out: all of the hotel staff are super friendly and very polite. They remember your name and refer to you personally, which is a very nice touch. Also, when you have room service delivered you don't have to go through the motions of signing the check. It's folded in an envelope on the room service tray. The workout area is first class. I think every machine had a TV screen. The pool though, was way too shallow. If you're going to offer a lap pool, make it deeper than 3 feet! The hot tub was nice but a few more jets would have made it better. We invited a guest for Sunday brunch and wound up being seated at a table for five stuffed in a corner right next to the door where the waiters kept coming and going through. The Georgian room is a spectacular restaurant visually and we would have preferred being in the middle of it instead of being stuck off in a corner. The restaurant manager comped us some fruit trays the next morning after we complained. But other than a few wrinkles, our stay was pleasant and pleasurable. If you stay here, remember to bring your wallet because it's expensive. But after all, it is a luxury hotel in the middle of downtown Seattle. ',GOOD,
'Exceptional comfort and warm service We booked in for a one-night stay at the Olympic after I had minor surgery in Seattle.Full disclosure here- I work in a hotel myself (not a Fairmont), so I am inclined to be forgiving of little things that go wrong; and we are low-maintenance travellers anyway so our needs are quite basic.That said, we greatly enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Olympic. Danny, the doorman went way, way out of his way to welcome us. I mean literally went out of his way - he walked me all the way to the escalators leading up to the lobby. From Adam on the front desk, we received a gracious welcome and keys to room 1007.This suite doesn't have what most people would consider a view, but given the very good rate we received, and knowing that you can't have stunning views in 100% of your rooms, I loved it. It's a long rectangle with three windows on the long side, so the late-afternoon light was beautiful. Boom - I'm sold right there. But I actually liked the view out over the rooftops into the city, especially the modern pre-fab house on exhibit on the roof of the building across the street.Two comfy armchairs, two side chairs, king bed, vast bathroom.Robert, the houseman, arrived shortly after we entered with our requested pillows - enough for our little dog to build herself a fine little nest while we were out. Speaking of which, they brought silver dishes on a silver tray with a linen cover for her to eat from.Since I couldn't really go out after my operation, we decided to order in from room service and enjoy a movie. I'm maybe the only person on the planet who doesn't really like room service; I like eating at a table with other people to watch, and room service food, it seems, is never at the right temperature. But that night we had the best room-service meal ever - a beautiful piece of salmon, buttermilk-fried chicken with biscuits, all of it piping hot. It was easily as good as a restaurant meal, with the added perk of getting to eat in a comfy hotel bathrobe and slippers.The bed was gorgeously comfortable with sparklingly-clean linens and a thick duvet. We decided to get an early start back in the morning and were pleased when the remote check-out service via TV presented an accurate, up-to-date folio and was easy to use.When we arrived at the arcade level to retrieve our car from valet parking, we found it waiting, doors and trunk open, with a bag containing milk and cookies for the trip home - nice touch. The doorman on duty, They(sp?) also brought some chilled bottled water. Given that the door/bell staff are both the first and the last contact with the hotel that guests will have, they have a lot of power to create a favourable impression and it's quite obvious that John, They and their team take that responsibility very seriously. We truly felt like highly-valued repeat guests whom they knew well, and they couldn't have been more helpful.Between the room, the food, and the kind service, we absolutely felt we got the perfect Fairmont experience from this stay. We certainly will go back. ',GOOD,
'Five Diamond Property Image Fell Apart I had extremely high hopes of this Landmark hotel and its reputed five diamond statusbut unfortunatelyAll of the 5 diamond image fell apart in a 24 hrs: Some of the main problems that we had were:- the room was very dusty. Under the cooling unit, you could see layers of dust-the bathroom phone was so dirty you could see it from a distance-the tap/faucet was leaking - our registration/payment was done through our conference agent and was never received.-The room was VERY small- If we asked for anything it look HOURS to arrive- I asked for slippers and they arrived the next day and after 4 phone calls- Restaurant in town recommended by Concierge was a bad oneGood Stuff:-Friendly staff-Nice House Car-Excellent location and lobby-Amazing fitness centre ',POOR,

'Perfect Perfect and very consistent 5 star experience. Particularly the staff performed without any glitches. You have to like the classical ambiente though. ',GOOD,
'Dissapointed at the Olympic I will have to admit, this hotel is well over rated, especially for the price. I am quite surprised every one reviews it as if its as fancy as staying in one of the Las Vegas 4 or 5 star hotels or better.In Las Vegas, this hotel would be considered a 3 star.The lobby is one of the least fancy i have ever seen in any fairmont property, (and i have stayed at at least a dozen of them.)I will give credit to the fact there was one lady at the concierge was very very kind, it was surreal.There on the other hand, was a male concierge , who ignored me as he flirted with a woman who was in town asking where the hip clubs would be, he must have stood there talking to her for 15 minutes , not even looking at me, or telling me he would be right with me in a moment,, nothing.I never did get the help that i needed.Next off, there is no place to buy any snacks, well there is a gift shop in the lower level which has about 2 flavors of potato chips to choose from, 1 cooler of beverages, maybe 4 types of chocolate bars, etc,etc, and it closes quite early. My main beef with the Olympic is that the rooms are small, and we received two single beds in our room, (that was just great for a romantic getaway for me and my wife, we got to sleep in two seperate beds). I went down to the front desk and there was no option to upgrade to 1 king bed without paying extra fees.For that kind of money , this is very surprising to meI have heard of two queen beds, but 2 single beds?I worried I would fall off the edge in the middle of the night.Who out there enjoys sleeping in a single bed?I did not know they even make those anymore do-they?The rooms also could use some renovating, including a flat screen tv for starters, its not common to get the old sears TV in the year 2008 in your room if you are in a upper class hotel.The location was great on the other hand, right across from the Purple restaurant, which has an unbelievable wine wall that is so high , it has a spiral staircase built around it to go up to get the bottle they need.Also nearby there is a great restaurant named the Brooklyn, 5 star dining for sure, great atmosphere, no candle light dinners or anything but very hip. Walking distance to almost anything you would need, such as the famous Pike Place Market, or the downtown shopping center and shops. ',POOR,
'True Excellence If I had to rate this hotel and staff on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm giving it a 20. Excellence in EVERYTHING. Hoorah. It's worth every penny spent. I'll certainly be back. ',GOOD,
'Classic charm Having spent the previous night in the W across the street, this hotel was a complete opposite in terms of it's furnishings.The candid photos (by others) do a great job in displaying the traditional classic floral decoration of the rooms, with comfy sofas in lieu of trendy cushion seats.All the usual amenities that you would expect from this class of hotel, but in a more sumptous format: high count cotton bed sheets, robes and slippers in the bathroom, quality toiletries, expensive mini-bar, safe, non-plasma TV, CD player etc.The shower was over the bath (prefer a separate unit) and the bathroom itself a little small, but the large bedroom (had upgraded to an executive room) made up for this.Nice touches like an umbrella in the wardrobe and friendly staff, made the place feel homely. The hotel is looking very slightly tired in some areas, but these large vast traditional places must take some upkeep.Views from the rooms are poor, as the hotel is surrounded by other large buildings on all sides.In summary, if you want trendy and modern go to the W, but if its classic sumptous comfort you desire, this is the place. Oh and try to get a high floor, away from the city noise below. ',GOOD,
'Classic but not perfect Stayed here for a medical meeting. Did not start out well, as, though I had a reserved an Executive King Suite, they warned me that the only one they had left was on the 2nd floor (near health club and street noise), despite the fact that I heard them giving the traveler next to me at check-in an upgrade to a suite on the tenth floor. I opted for a deluxe room on the 6th floor. The room was well appointed, medium sized and generally comfortable, if a notch below Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton levels in finishes and level of upkeep. The other major problem I had was that my key card kept deactivating - I literally ended up at reception at least once a day during my 5 days there to have it re-keyed. They suggested that it might have something to do with my cellphone, but I kept it in different places and it was clear to me that it was being deactivated by the hotel.Otherwise, the service was good, health club was attractive, food was so-so, though there are lots of great food options nearby (Purple and Wild Ginger stood out).One other minor complaint - coffeemaker (they have those nice single cup pod ones these days) in room would have been really nice, though they have complimentary coffee in health club and lobby.

'Fairmont Seattle       bathtub ',GOOD,
'The Best! We just returned from six nights at the Fairmont Olympic in Seattle. This was absolutely one of the best hotels in which we've EVER stayed. It's not the most upscale (Four Seasons New York, George V Paris, etc.) in which we've stayed. And many of the rooms don't have views. And (omygod) the televisions are not flat screen and are still on stands, not in armoires (hence only four stars?). But then why would you watch tv in Seattle on six sunny days?The location is terrific. The place is immaculate. The service is superb. Without exception, from the doormen, the room service staff, the restaurant staff, the concierge (ALL fabulous, esp. Patrick and those baseball tickets!), and the front desk, to the valets who gallantly parked our daughter's seen-better-days antique Subaru, et al. Everyone is professional, friendly, genuine, well-trained.The beds were MamaBear comfortable (not too hard, not too soft). We never saw the housekeepers, but we always had fresh towels, ice, weather forecasts. The windows open! The a.c. works!Maybe it was just the perfect weather. But we travel a lot, and we came away thinking that this was the perfect hotel. ',GOOD,
'Fairmont is slipping I've been staying here for years. This used to be one of the best hotels in the city. When it was a Four Seasons it was the class of Seattle. Fairmont took over and they did a good job...not a great job. Unfortunately, in the time they've had this hotel, details have slipped. Rooms are getting a bit run down. Details that Four Seaons never miss are being missed. If you stay here, get a quiet room away from the busier street corners. The hotel offers very little insulation from street noise. Bottom line is that this is a nice hotel...but it's not what it used to be. Unfortunately. ',POOR,
'Classy Hotel in the heart of Seattle I have stayed in this hotel about 15 times in the last three years, for a total maybe 45 days. Each and every stay was special. The hotel is classy. To be honest, it is not really my style. I tend to go for boutique hotels, moneys allowing. However I never switch hotels here. PRO:- Best service ever. I all of my stays I have experience only once a slight impatience from a member of the staff. The rest of the time the staff was bending backwards and really doing their very best to honestly try to accommodate- Great location, with nice views. Some of the corner rooms have great views of the river but even the other have very nice views of the surroundings- Magical atmosphere: no matter how difficult the day was, the hotel staff creates a great atmosphere. The little touches like having the bed prepared and the Jazz channel in turned on every evening, the room made twice a day, the music in the hall, etc. - Great gym: quite a few treadmills and similar cardio machines. A nice gym with some machines, a swimming pool, a great sauna facilities, etc. Again, nice touches like getting water bottles, headsets and having personal TVs on every treadmill. Very rejuvenatingCONs:- It does not have a modern look to it. If you're absolutely looking for that go to the W across the street.- Expensive, not necessarily overpriced, if you don't have a corporate discount.Word of advice: even though the hotel occupies a whole block, it is often booked well in advance. So make a reservation as soon as you canAlso, when you reserve the restaurant through the Concierge, not only do you get great recommendations (they really understand what you are after), but you also get sometimes a free appetizer thrown in courtesy of the Fairmont Concierge,really a great hotel. Would go back even if I was traveling on my won, and not for business. ',GOOD,
'Above and Beyond - Olympic Service Our group of 10 stayed at this property before and after an Alaska cruise departing from the Port of Seattle. One night before the cruise and three nights post cruise. We booked through the AMEX Centurion Card, so we received a number of perks.PROS: Location is ideal for walking about without being in the middle of the fray at Pike Market. There is a great restaurant across the street too, sort of a trendy tapas/wine bar, but the food was wonderful, fairly priced and despite the initial air of pretense they were very welcoming of the five children in our group (including three wee lads).Town car service was handy and freely offered.Food in the Georgian was perfect, really, perfect is the word. From fresh local cherries to the best chicken hash you could imagine the breakfast food was divine. We had room service dinners and the food was equally outstanding.Rooms were on the charming side, but the furnishings and finishes were first rate, the bed was of the top of the line nature with down comforter, fancy sheets, pillow top mattress. The windows actually open which is a very nice feature in Seattle with the refreshing sea air.The fitness/pool area was a little oasis in the city and hit the spot.But beyond everything else the service in this hotel was as good as the best hotels in Europe or Asia. We were greeted by name throughout our stay, we were remembered on our return visit a week later. Servers were great with our three small children in the restaurants, not to mention the milk and cookies and toys. The best example was the kitchen fire on the day of our departure (10 guests mind you) that set off the smoke alarms throughout the hotel and put their emergency announcements into action and elevators were turned off for safety. We were on the 4th floor and needed to depart as our shuttle van was at the front door. We called the bell desk and at first were told that they could not come for our bags due to the elevator issue, I then explained our deadline to get to the airport and 4, yes four, bellmen came immediately to our room and brought our bags down 4 flights of stairs with smiles and good spirits. CONS:The Shuckers Restaurant had very slow service, it was almost like the staff there were not on the same channel as the rest of the hotel, I think it may be a concession.The entry from the main street requires going up a level from the lobby, minor issue, part of the charm of an older hotel.We will only stay at the Olympic on future visits.

'In a class of its own... Stayed at the Olympic for 2 nights in August. This is a beautiful property situated in the center of downtown Seattle. Within walking distance to great shopping and a short trip to Pike Place Market and the waterfront.The hotel itself is an older hotel but it has been kept up to high standards. The rooms can be small and have some outside noise creep in but all in all they are very nice. The staff itself is top notch. They are willing and able to help at every turn.The hotel offer some great amenties. The health club includes a pool, spa and many work out machines. Complimentary water is also provided. Room service is quick and very good and the bell service is top notch.If your looking for a high quality hotel in the downtown Seattle area, you cant go wrong with the Olympic. ',GOOD,
'Would return again for personal trip Stayed for conference 3 nights for work and loved the location in downtown. Looking forward to planning a personal trip in the future to stay here again.Belle's buns (they serve coffee in fine china) and Shuckers (anything with crab is yummy) restaurants are located in the hotel and are street assessible. Highly recommended for bfast and lunch (most high end restaurants offer business lunches, a great bargain as a means to sample great food and service). Wish I had the time to try the Georgian tea at the hotel, next time...Stayed in twin room, 2 twin beds with good support, pay per view tv, high speed internet access, mini bar w/ snacks, spacious bathroom (great lighting and close up mirrors), small closet but tall, in room safe, robes, slippers, ample toiletries, strong shower pressure, hairdryer, turndown service nightly, 2 alarm clocks, touch of vintage to their lobby but was a great area to meet others or take a break and listen to piano in early pm, terrific room service (continental breakfast was amazing - freshly baked muffins, chocolate croissants).Walking distance to Triple Door (a supper club that looks amazing), Benaroya Hall, Wild Ginger, 7-8 blocks from Pike's place, cabs are easy to find...

'Loved it! My husband and I stayed for three nights at the Fairmont Olympic and we loved it! We stayed in an executive suite and found the room to be very comfortable with a sitting area and separate bedroom. There was a lot of extra space to store luggage and many drawers and a large closet to unpack. We used the workout area each morning and really enjoyed the wide variety of equipment available to the guests. Complimentary coffee was served right off the gym in the pool area, a great place to relax and read the newspaper or order breakfast. The concierge service was very knowledgeable and gave us some excellent sightseeing recommendations. The excellent staff, service, amenities and central location made the Fairmont a perfect place to stay during our vacation. I highly recommend it. ',GOOD,
'No longer a Five Diamond hotel In early July 2007 we had a Deluxe Executive Suite. The suite was lacking in several ways and certainly doesn't live up to their website description. For example, they state: The suites feature a luxurious master bedroom with a well-appointed marble bathroom. However, the bathroom had almost no marble, and its appointments were very ordinary for an average hotel and absolutely doesn't meet the expectations for a hotel that boasts that they are Pacific Northwest's only AAA Five Diamond hotel. It was not much better than a bath you would find in a Best Western hotel.The furniture was average at best, with the dresser located far way from the bedroom. The room didn't contain interesting or original art work. It lacked plants or flowers. The suite had 2 small TVs on push carts. The suite had french doors to the bedroom and they were nice. The closet space was very good and a full ironing board was appreciated.Do not go there on a Sunday or Monday because much of the hotel's dining facilities are shutdown.You would expect extraordinary service for a hotel of this class but the reception desk in the afternoon and morning was functional but cold. However, the Bell staff and concierge were very helpful. The concierge was able to arrange last minute reservations at Wild Ginger.In summary, there are many choices in Seattle, and I would not recommend the Fairmont Olympic. ',POOR,
'fabulous stay stayed here for a business conference in June 2007. Fabulous service. Staff very friendly and was good with quick tourist attractions as time was very limited as it was a business trip. Even received a bottle of water from the bellhop after going for a morning run ! Room size was fine, centrally located, slept finewould stay again easily ',GOOD,
'Fairmont Olympic: Fabulous Life was substantially better for three days this week - I was a guest at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel. As a Seattle native, I purchased a gift certificate for a two night stay at the Olympic at a non-profit fund raising event. My expections were rather high, as the Fairmont chain has an excellent reputation. However, I was not prepared for the extraordinary level of service and attention to guest comfort that I received at this property. Every employee I encountered was friendly, knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile to ensure my stay was as pleasant as possible. Kudo's to the customer service group who some how ensure every staff member acknowledges the guest by name. All hotel employees - doormen, front desk personnel , business center attendants, dining and room service wait staff, bellmen - all greeted me by name throughout my stay .... Most Impressive! I would recommend the Fairmont Olympic without hesitation. In addition, the room and all public spaces were spotless and extremely comfortable ',GOOD,
'Great Location Stayed at the Fairmont while traveling on business. Great location. Friendly staff. Clean room and bathroom. Super comfy bed. Music in room, what a nice touch. Room was a bit noisy since it was facing the street, but I did not mind. Cute gift shop downstairs. In walking distance of attractions. I was pleased with my stay. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Hotel Stayed at this hotel for a business trip and I was impressed the minute I arrived. The hotel is well kept and extremely clean. The front desk is very helpful and very kind...not the phony type of kindness you would normally get. The room was impecable. Very clean and well maintained. Food was a little pricey...they have a seafood restaurant in the hotel called Scheckey's and the starting price for dinner was around $40.00. If you like seafood, this is the restaurant for you. When you call the front desk, they know its you that is calling. What I did not like was that there are not many places to eat around this hotel for a quick bite. Dont get me wrong..the food was amazing but a little pricey. If you like baseball, Safeco field is only a 20 minute walk from the hotel and along the way, there are plenty of bars and small restaurants to try. ',GOOD,
'Absolutely wonderful I stayed here for a business conference. My husband and I agreed that this hotel is one of the nicest we have stayed in. We booked a standard room, which was beautifully appointed and spacious, with a nice city view. The facility was lovely, but what sets the Fairmont Olympic apart from others in its class is the service. It was perfect-- extremely helpful and attentive, but not cloying. Every person that we dealt with-- from the bell staff, to the reception desk, to random employees we just passed in the hallway-- was courteous, professional and greeted us with a smile and an offer to assist us. It's hard to describe perfect service in words, but when you experience it, it's much appreciated.I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle, as it would be a let-down after the Fairmont. ',GOOD,
'Terrible service for weddings! The hotel is gorgeous and the service within the hotel is superb.I would not recommend spending your money for a wedding though in the Fairmont Seattle. First of all, the department that handles weddings can use a course or 2 on customer service. The girl handling our event was not accomodating and not pleasant to deal with and when we elevated it to her superior it became worse bec he did nothing to appease our concerns by just defending the girl we complained about in the 1st place. It gave us a feeling of them being cocky and it was a favor to us we were having our event in their hotel. It is disheartening bec you are dealing w a hotel and hospitality  customer satisfaction should be their number 1 concern. If our deposit wasnt already forfeited we wouldve seriously considered moving locations for our special day. After our event, we complained again that the airconditioning was not working properly (at the wedding reception) and other kinks that went wrong within the event. The head of the department DID NOTHING again to contribute to our experience with a more pleasant ending. It was like talking to a wall. Anyway dont make the mistake of spending a ton of money in the Fairmont for less than mediocre treatment. Once they have u sign that contract say bye-bye to good cust service. You are better off doing it in another hotel that will go out of THEIR way to treat you and your day with the importance you deserve... ',POOR,
'Fabulous! We stayed at the Fairmont Olympic for four nights and loved it. The property was beautiful and the service was impeccable. The health club is the best I have ever used at a hotel. Every person we encountered affiliated with the Fairmont Olympic was incredibly professional and helpful-many thanks to David the bartender in Shuckers for great restaurant tips and Mary the concierge for great help with lots of things! Definately would stay here again. Chris and Lisa ',GOOD,
'Nice, but not what one might expect. Pretty nice, especially since work was picking it up and they got a corporate discount. The front desk booked me into a dirty room, then gave me a new one, and a bottle of nasty Cabernet to make up for it. The location was great and the suite (clean one) was nicely appointed. ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel In Seattle I live near seattle and frequently have business meetings at this hotel.. after my first visit to the fairmont seattle I wanted to come back with my family we enjoyed it so much that we go here as oftend as we can(my daughter loves this hotel so much she had her birthday here).I have stayed at numerous Seattle hotels but none was as good as this one... Service:The service here is expectational for a five star hotel, it meets up to it's fairmont name.-Very very kid friendly, [ at every visit my two kids recieved a complimentry cookies and milk delivered to our room.. the milk was cold and the cookies are always still warm from the oven which is always a nice touch ] -while staying here during christmas time my kids would recieve a complimentary gift package with a bunch of fun toys and games, they quite enjoyed them :)-also, almost always we are upgraded to a suite -by the pool they offer complimentry water bottles and sometimes complimentry gatorade...In the morning they offer hot tea which is a nice thing to wake up to.-toys are by the pool such as kick boards and such for people to use.-here is a tip ask for some ecalyptus for the sauna at the pools front desk they will give you some, complimentry ROOMS- The rooms are nice and well equiped with esentials -2 robes and slippers are availible for use, if you are traveling with kids call housekeeping and order 2 kids robes which are made smaller. ANY OTHER FACTS:- The lobby is beautifully decorated.-when it is raining (which seems to occur often in seattle) ask for an umbrella they will lend you one for the day.-try to come in during christmas they bring in a huge tree decorated to a certain theme... also this year they had a gingerbread sculpture of this hotel which was very cool to look at.-if you want a good seafood dinner go to the hotel restaurantI have eaten here many times and have never been disatisfied with the taste ( the sirloin burger is phenomanal so are the fish dishes.. look at the specials)If you have chosen this hotel to stay at for your seattle visit you have not chosen wrong!! You will enjoy every minute of this wonderful city and just as great, hotel!! ',GOOD,
'Needs Updating The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was in need of refurbishment. My main complaint was the traffic noise (although I am much more fussy than normal about this sort of thing - others probably do not notice it). But I think they should consider putting in double glazing. ',POOR,
'A BIG disappointment My wife and I booked a 1200 square foot corner suite for $860 per night. Check in was a series of empty promises which kept us waiting with our todler for over an hour before we could get into our room. They also couldn't tell from their reservation system whether we booked one room or the whole suite - if I hadn't corrected them they would have happily put us in one room only for the same price. The rooms in the suite were large but dated. The bathrooms were not at all up to standard for a 4 + star hotel - one of them didn't even have heat. After the long wait to get into our suite there was a TV remote missing and the toilet didn't work. When we left the next morning the bellman proudly told me we didn't need a cab - he could run us to our destination (a few blocks away) in the hotel town car. Sure enough when I went and got my wife child and luggage a different bellman met me and explained that the car was gone and there must have been a mistake. We took a cab, driving right past the hotel town car which remained parked in the drive. This was a two star experience at best. Disorganised and disrespectful. ',POOR,
'Watch out for the packages! The hotel is beautiful, no doubt. But, we bought two consecutive package deals for two nights. They included parking, yet they charged us for it. When I tried to get refunded, I was not treated very well. Other than that, it is a great place to stay - just make sure you check your bill before you leave! ',POOR,
'Fabulous hotel for romance or family weekend In Dec 06 we stayed here for two different nights, one week apart.The first Saturday night stay we booked a room because my husband's office holiday party was at the hotel, so we thought we'd make a whole night of it. We had a beautiful deluxe room with a King bed. The furnishings, drapes, etc. are a bit dated, I must say, but still very classy and lovely, with a formal feeling. The service was top-notch, though. Marble bathroom was nice enough, though could definitely use an update, especially the tub/shower. There was no fan in the bathroom, which leaves the mirror steamed up after a shower. Fluffy white robes are provided, which are nice to don when you go use the indoor heated pool and jacuzzi--this wonderful big room is in a glass atrium so you can see the sky and the city. The second Saturday stay was with our three kids (7, 4, and 1). We booked an Executive Suite, which is larger. The King bedroom has French doors that keep it separate (sort of) from the sitting area with a pullout sofa. I never thought of this hotel as a kid-friendly hotel until our stay--they are awesome to kids! When we checked in, each child received a gift bag with age-appropriate goodies/toys. Each child also received a certificate for free milk/cookies room service. Once we settled into our room we called room service, and soon a very nice guy came with a silver tray laden with fabulous choc chip cookies and kid cups with milk and magic color-changing straws. Big hit with the kids :) We went out to dinner and did some of the Christmas-y things around downtown, then came back to the hotel for a swim. The closet had 5 fluffy white robes: two adult ones, two kid ones, and to our absolute delight, a tiny little robe for our toddler! I didn't know they made these hotel robes for toddlers :) The kids LOVED their robes, and LOVED the pool/jacuzzi. There is a basket full of kids' pool toys--noodles, floaty toys, boogie boards--which all the kids enjoyed.What could take this hotel from a 4-star to a 5-star rating:- Update the bathrooms and some of the room's furnishings.- Get new portable cribs. For a Fairmont hotel, I was quite surprised to get a portacrib that looked like it was about 15 years old, with tatters and rust on some of the joints. It was so old we couldn't even figure out how to open it up at first, since it didn't open and get set up like the newer portacribs do. We have stayed at Grand Hyatts, Marriotts, Four Seasons, etc., and never have gotten a portacrib like this before.- Put glass on the French doors in the suites. The whole wall has no sound barrier because there is no glass on the doors or windows--just open frames with dainty little curtains on them. Why bother, really, if there is no sound barrier (hence, privacy) provided?!- Newer TVs. Flat-screen would be even better!I would still stay here again, because the service, pool/jacuzzi, and kid-friendly features are just too good to pass up. But I would bring my own portacrib next time! Maybe by next December some of these issues will have gotten resolved. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful hotel Our family of four spent two nights at the Fairmont between Christmas and New Years and had a terrific stay. I had a problem trying to book a special price on-line and called the property. The reservations staffer told me that the rooms were not available, but then helped me get a larger room at the same price. Our rooms were spacious and well-appointed. The property itself was very dressed up for the season and looked beautiful.The hotel has a great fitness center that includes a lap pool, jacuzzi and sauna in addition to weight and cardio machines.The concierge steered us to excellent dinners both nights. We went to Shuckers, the more casual of the two restaurants in the hotle, for dessert one evening and were shocked that the size of the chocolate cake and mud pie items that our kids ordered. Four of us couldn't finish these two dishes. The waiter was very friendly and engaging.The surrounding neighborhood is one of Seattle's nicest. Our kids were thrilled that we let them go off on their own for some shopping in the area for an hour or two each night. ',GOOD,
'Much To Love, but Not Perfect I stayed a few weeks in this hotel and there is much to love, but don鈥檛 expect everything to be perfect. It is a grand old building that is impressive, and you really feel like you are someplace special. The staff usually, but not always, treats you amazingly well and no matter who you call or speak to they seem to know your name. My rooms were always spacious and cozy, the turndown service (including filling the ice tray) a great treat, the hotel restaurants are great (one is quite pricey), room service has great food and comes fast, and the workout room is fabulous. Some flaws include worn carpets and furniture, some service issues such as occasional long delays and confusion with valet parking, and one or two of the doormen are sometimes moody (for example, one friend was treated poorly by a doorman for missing a tip one day, after weeks of giving him and others $5 tips). Overall, as a business traveler I will always stay at the Fairmont since it is one of the best in Seattle and for that reason, I view the Fairmont鈥檚 flaws are simply part of its character. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful for the holidays... After going without power a few days from the recent windstorm, were we glad we had made weekend reservations at the Fairmont Seattle. It's a perfect location for Christmas shopping, the concierge and front desk staff are top-notch and very helpful.We had reserved an executive suite which was a king bed in one room, and a couch and sitting area in another. We hosted a wine tasting with friends before dinner and a show and the sitting room worked out perfectly. Ordered a wine set up (glasses, etc) and a fruit and cheese platter from in-room dining which made it a bit more special. Delicious selection of cheeses, crackers, grapes, dried fruit and mini-pears came on the tray.Parking at the hotel is $30 a night, room was $180. Bathroom was immaculate - only one bath towel for the two of us but housekeeping quickly fixed things up. Also the dial on the heater/a/c needed adjusting which we let them know at check-out.The hotel is decorated beautifully for the holidays with a huge tree in the lobby. We missed the carolers (they're there between 12-1pm) but we did see the huge gingerbread replica of the hotel. Very cute. We've eaten at both the Georgian Room and Shuckers in the past (good food) but other than the in-room dining this time we ate at Pike's (Cafe Campagne - delicious for brunch - recommend reservations).We also used the fitness facilities in the morning. Heavy chlorine smell from the pool in the cardio area but it's a very nice workout room.We could hear the showers from neighboring rooms in the morning which woke me up. Wish the walls were a little thicker. Make sure to ask for a room away from University Ave (traffic noise) and high up. ',GOOD,
'My Seattle favorite This is my favorite place to stay while in Seattle on business, or there with my wife for a weekend getaway. It has a great location, within walking distance of the downtown hub. And the Georgian restaurant in the hotel...superb! It is rare to find a restaurant that has better service; it is our top choice for any elegant dinner occasion. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Fairmont!! Woweeee!!!! Great rooms, great service, and the humps that carried my luggage were little soldiers. I tipped them about what they deserved.Out. ',GOOD,
'very nice We just stayed 30 Oct - 1 Nov at the Fairmont during a conference. We had already booked the hotel when I got around to reading some less than stellar reviews here. We feared the worst, but found a great location, room and staff. Our small suite was nice, not overly large, especially the apartment sized tub, but everything working, smelling clean or not at all (no mold), sheets impeccable, no sounds from anywhere did we hear, street, other room, hallway. We were on 3rd floor, overlooking hotel drive entrance. Everyone on the staff was helpful and smile-y. The fitness center was very nice. We ate at Shucker's in the hotel one night, it was fair, nothing to rave about. The door personnel were always helpful and always multiple of them. We thought the hotel offered value for the price and a wonderful experience. ',GOOD,
'Good News and Bad News at the Fairmont Olympic Just returned last night from a two-night stay at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle...I stayed there several years ago when this was a Four Seasons property and, despite the mixed reviews on here, thought I'd give them a try since my experience was such a good one back then. Well...I'll start with the good news. You are made to feel welcome from the moment you walk in the door...very friendly staff, people running to open the door, always a smile from anyone you come into contact with. The concierge and the front desk team are also very accomodating. The grand lobby is as I remembered it, and they have perhaps the best gym and pool facility I've seen in a hotel in this country. Wonderful locker room too, full of amenities. All of this is wonderful, but when we stay at a hotel we expect more than just friendly service, particularly at $350 per night! The rooms are, how shall I say it, awful. When we checked in late Friday night, we went into our room and it smelled like mold. It was as if we stepped into a 1970's time warp too...the room was big, but everything about it looked dated and cheap, from the wallpaper to the lighting fixtures. The room was big, but there was almost no furniture in it so it looked kind of ridiculous. We called downstairs and requested to be moved...thankfully, the second room didn't smell, but again everything felt very dated. I felt as though we were paying Four Seasons prices for a Ramada room. All of that said, you can't beat the location and the service (the valet car parkers even leave milk and cookies when they bring your car around for check out!), though we will be trying one of the many other nice hotels in the neighborhood on our next visit...Fairmont, this was a real let-down...get it together in Seattle! ',POOR,
'A little disappointing My husband and two children (14/8) stayed here for two nights. We chose this hotel as it had availability but mostly because it had a separate bedroom, separated by french doors. When we arrived it had french doors alright, don't think they'd been closed ever as they were pinned back with furniture. But the kicker was...that they had NO glass in the doors..just sheers...so NO privacy or peace and quiet what so ever.Also, they had two tv's in this small space..one just outside the french doors and one in the bedroom, back to back to the other one. There was no way you could have both tv's going at the same time as the doors offered no sound barrier of course. The overall decor of the hotel was dated and tired looking. The entrance in the circular driveway was welcoming and classy, but basically it ends there. It's an old hotel that's looking old. Will not stay there again....just doesn't do it for our family. ',POOR,
'Superb concierge and staff service!!! Stayed for a week in July 2006. Had a wonderful time based mainly on suggestions from the concierge staff relative to dining and activities. There were only three negatives: We were given a room, which obviously had been a smoking room at one time, as it stunk. The housekeeping staff was most helpful in that they sprayed the room on a regular basis, which assisted greatly with the problem. The second being the stained arm chair and carpet. It would seem an establishment of the Fairmont's stature could afford to completely renovate the room to rid it of the smoky smell permanently and replace the upholstery and carpet. The spa, which is in the same building, was quite a letdown as it was dirty (dust everywhere) and slightly cheesy in that the pedicure consisted of placing one's feet in a plastic tub, as opposed to having a chair with a built-in tub to soak in and when offered a drink, it was water, which had obviously been drawn from the sink and was warm. My point being it was the spa suggested by the staff. Aside from these annoyances, the room was great, and the service absolutely spectacular!!!!! ',GOOD,
'Disgusting I cannot believe after reading previous reviews that we stayed at the same hotel. We arrived at the Fairmont, after travelling from the UK to discover they had our reservation for a delux suite, but were full ! We were two females traveling together (mother  daughter) aged 55 and 75 and we were offered by the duty manager a small king room + sub standard sofa bed which we declined, we where then offered another small king room with a rollaway only suitable for a child which would have to be situated in the bathroom / dressing room. Finally we were offered a single room with twin beds. The Duty Manager acknowleged it was a single room but had no alternative to offer us !. Their compensation was room service of tea and toast at 8.00 p.m. !The toilet did not work properly and tolitteries were hardly ever left, however, the ladies in congieage were delightful. We would certainly never return to this hotel again, the lobby area and Georgian Room is lovely but the rooms (which we saw 3) are definaetly not five star qulaity. ',POOR,
'Hotel Perfection My wife and I and our three small children -- ages 5 to 10 -- just completed a week's stay at the Olympic, and our visit could not have been more enjoyable. Immediately upon check-in, the kids each received a gift pack of books and toys, as well as a free room-service offer of cookies and milk. We had two connecting suites, and though pricey and not as spacious as at some properties, they were impeccably clean, well appointed, and the bedding -- including huge, luxurious down pillows -- allowed for an incredibly good night's sleep. The concierge staff -- there were typically at least three available -- cheerfully arranged excursions, as well as babysitting services. The food was fantastic: room service was wonderful, Shuckers was fun, and at the Georgian we enjoyed one of the best prix fixe meals we've had anywhere in the world. We made good use of the lovely indoor pool and the adjoining exercise room and sauna. An added bonus was the availability of a vehicle and driver for trips within the downtown area. The entire staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. All in all, a perfect hotel experience, and one we hope to relive soon. ',GOOD,
'Very impressive - won't feel bad        ',GOOD,
'Fantastic I have stayed at many nice hotels and many Fairmonts but my one-night stay at the Fairmont Olympic in Seattle this past Sunday has to go down as one of the best hotel stays of my life. I'll just offer one example of the personalized and fantastic service...early on Sunday as I was travelling, I hadI called the concierge to ask that they reserve a New York Times for me as I would not be arriving until evening and when I arrived, sure enough there was a Times set aside for me at the concierge...however, the next morning I had room service for breakfast delivered but had not asked for a Times or any paper for that matterr, however when my breakfast and coffee was rolled in at 9:30am, they had included an NYT as well and it was surely the perfect touch to start my day. It may not have been much but the personalization of the service, even for someone only there for one night (when combined with the greatly helpful and friendly concierge and bell staff) made it a wonderful experience. ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel in the USA This is the best hotel ever!! What great service, food, art-- and all in such a stunning building. This hotel is as wonderful as the city of Seattle! A+++ Friendly and also well mannered and kids love it. ',GOOD,
'Spectacular Hotel       The breakfast I ordered. Very yummy. ',GOOD,
'Smoky no longer! As a native resident to the state of Washington and now a citizen of San Francisco, I feel compelled to write an update on behalf of this fantastic property. Many reviews on this site decry a poor service stay because of the smoky smell. Although this was true in the past, it no longer applies. I have stayed on numerous occassions in the past three years while visiting relatives, and up until November 2005 (I believe that was the exact month) smoking was allowed in public spaces in the state of Washington. Thankfully, the state finally caught up to California and banned smoking in public places such as the lobby of the fantastic Fairmont Olympic. On my most recent trip, it appeared that the lobby carpeting and furniture had been replaced, and because smoking is no longer allowed the smell is completely fresh! I would recommend that the complainers on this site give the hotel another shot. Their concerns were warrented in the past but are no longer necessary.The rest of my experience was great! Shuckers is a great place to relax and grab a bite of fresh PNW seafood. After a late flight, my fiance and I decided to try and catch a late bite to eat before heading to our room. To our delight, the waitstaff allowed us to order a few smaller items (5 minutes before their posted closing time) without any grief. That's a welcome relief from other hotel's rigid closing-hour policies.All in all, this hotel is the best in Seattle in my books. ',GOOD,
'Best hotel in Seattle The Olympic is without a doubt the finest hotel in Seattle. I've stayed here almost a dozen times and have never been disappointed. The lobby, dining room, and ballroom are gorgeous, and the service is always of the highest quality. The food is outstanding. I read a few other reviews on this site that were less than glowing and felt compelled to respond. The hotel is not smoky and in fact smoking in buildings open to the public was banned by a Seattle ordinance in late 2005. I've stayed at several other Fairmont properties, and the Olympic is definitely up to standards. The rooms are lovely, the health club and locker facilities are wonderful, and nowhere else in Seattle do you have the charm, decorum and sense of history that you find at the Olympic. It is a perfect location for special events, or a stay for business or pleasure. In recent years, several other upscale hotels have come to Seattle (W, Monaco, etc.), but they tend to be pretentious and nouveau riche, while the Olympic is a delightful Seattle tradition. ',GOOD,
'I felt like Royalty! From soup to nuts, what a pampering!! I didn't want to leave. They thought of everything! When we came back from a jog the bell men were waiting with towels and water bottles! The bathroom had a nightlight, Q-tips and cotton balls. The fitness center changing rooms had razors, and hair gel! Every detail was covered! Those that whined in their review are spoiled brats and obviously blow their noses in gold tissues. Thank you Fairmont for 4 days of Royalty!! ',GOOD,
'Fairmont Olympic is pretty nice       Lobby ',GOOD,
'Very nice My wife and I just stayed at the Fairmont Hotel in Seattle. Overall, it was a fairly nice stay. The hotel looked a little dated, but nevertheless, quite elegant. The service was very good, from the doormen to the concierges to the desk personnel. We ate at two of their restaurants, the Georgian and Shuckers and were very pleased at the service and the quality of the food. We were pleasantly surprised that they even had a complimentary towncar and driver for use when available. The location was excellent, being within a few blocks of many of the downtown shops and also one block from a car rental office in the Hilton. The only problem I recalled was that the windows in the room were old and didn't block out street noise very well. I would say that the stay was well worth the rate that we got for an executive suite; $185 a night. I'm not sure I would stay here for over $300 a night though. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Hotel We stayed in the Fairmont Olympic for 5 nights this January and loved it. We had a beautiful corner room (1101) on the top floor, which is all non-smoking. The room was very clean with a comfortable king size bed, nice sitting area and desk, and plenty of room for hanging clothes. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the visit. We loved just sitting in the beautiful lobby and drinking wine. I would not hesitate to stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Fairmont The cigar smoke in the lobby is absolutely horrible. It's a shame that one can't enjoy such a beautifully designed lobby, but the smoke is overpowering and completely detracts from enjoyment. ',POOR,
'Grand, older hotel I stayed here when this was a Four Seasons property and this Fairmont property is almost as nice. It is an older, grand-style hotel with some of the minor accompanying problems: outdated heating and a/c system, more street noise due to a lack of double-glazed windows, a smaller gym and pool, and a decor that is starting to show its age. Overall, it was very comfortable and in an excellent location blocks from everything. I was there for a business meeting and had a reduced convention rate, so it was well worth it. I wouldn't pay $300+ to stay there next time. ',GOOD,
'Not up to Fairmont Standards or Mine The Fairmont Olympic was acquired by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts fairly recently, and I must say that numerous traditional Fairmont standards of hospitality and amenities are still absent from the hotel. I am a Fairmont President's Club Platinum member, the most prestige status, and I did not feel that I was treated to those standards over the course of the stay.Upon arrival, we were greeted courteously by one of the head bellmen and valet parkers, Rick (being the most amiable staff member over the course of the stay, I voted him as the Employee of the Month). The hotel's exterior is extraordinary, with sweeping windows and pillars. Numerous high-end in-hotel shoppes dot the street front, such as Coach and Jeri Rice. The lush, manicured gardens boast some of the only green grass in Seattle in August, and the circular driveway is always alive with comings and goings of guests. However, disappointment strikes when one enters the hotel.My first impression was that it seemed rather smoky. It also seemed quite poorly designed, considering that one must take an escalator up to the main lobby. Later, we discovered that the outdated elevators service the lower level (called the Arcade level), which has a convenience store and women's clothing store. I must say that my mood turned once we reached the lobby, which held the grandeur that I expect from these grande dames. Numerous lavish seats (though they do need re-covering) populate the lobby, with the scrumptious Georgian room off to one side and a grand ballroom on the other.Check-in did not run particularly smoothly. Unlike most Fairmont hotels that I have come to respect, there was not a separate Fairmont President's Club check-in counter in full view. While the check-in representative was well-mannered, there was annoying confusion over our length of stay that persisted throughout it. Due to a change in room rates, we were booked under two separate reservations. These should have been linked prior to arrival, but instead posed confusion for us and the check-in representative. Furthermore, we added to our Fairmont President's Club profile long ago that we like to receive three room keys as opposed to two. This was not ready for us.As I stated earlier, the elevators were quite outdated. Rather than having floor readers above them like most, there is a central panel that shows the location of each elevator. I found it quite an eyesore. The elevators also seem to lurch and are very unsteady, causing queasiness on my part. Luckily I only had to ride to the sixth floor!I would have to stay that the room was the greatest disappointment of our week-long stay. With my status at Fairmont I am used to only the best of the best: rooms full of character, views, and added amenities. This room had very little of this. Upon entering, my first reaction was that the non-smoking room was quite smoky; the hotel had not done a sufficient job of airing it out from past eras when smoking and non-smoking rooms were not allocated separately. The room also lacked art. A single, small piece hung above the shabbily-covered chesterfield in the sitting area which also served as my bed. The boring wallpaper did nothing to help the overall appeal of the room. The bathroom was equally as depressingly boring, and did not have Fairmont's regular bathroom amenities. I might presume that they were using the leftover soaps and shampoos from Four Seasons. The master bedroom was certainly nothing special either, and did not have a closet of its own. My family members had to walk through the living room to access the closet.Throughout the stay, we began to forget the depressing features of our room and enjoy the many amenities that Seattle has to offer. We found that the hotel was conveniently located to everything we needed to do, and the valet service was quite reliable. The New York Times was delivered to our door each morning and the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, USA Today, and local Seattle Times were at our disposal. The concierge service was quite helpful in finding us a local steakhouse. We had a chance to explore some of the ballrooms that the hotel holds, as well as the majestic Garden Room. The smokiness of the hotel continued to annoy me, however.We had some minor issues with staff and logistics over the course of the stay. Firstly, we found it redundant to have to request a coffee maker, when we had never had to do so before at a Fairmont. In addition, the issue of the two separate reservations persisted through our stay. On the fifth morning, we found a check-out bill under our door, which was quite unwelcome. The housekeeping had not done its daily cleaning as a result of the confusion, and our room keys were de-activated. This was a major logistical flaw on the part of the hotel. I do hope that, as Fairmont continues to take over and Four Seasons disappears, it will live up to my high but reasonable standards for this generally spectacular chain. Olympic Hotel executives should consider examining the services of the Ch芒teau Lake Louise, Fairmont Banff Springs, Fairmont Turnberry Isle Resort and Club, Fairmont Southampton Princess, and others. Currently, I believe that the Olympic is in the conversional stage. ',POOR,
'Good Hotel but service not 5 star I don't think this is a 5 star hotel. After a recent stay at the Fairmont Olympic I'd have to say that if I had to put the Olympic against the Fairmont Airport or Waterfront the latter would win hands down. The only significant difference in service here was being addressed by name, which in my case is actually mildly annoying since I have a difficult to pronounce name and then have to confirm that they got the pronunciation right!The hotel was accommodating in arranging an early check-in at 10 am even though they were sold out the night before and were again sold out the night I was staying. The room was of decent size and nicely furnished with a view of the street. The bathroom was stocked with Quercus amenities from the U.K. and had a digital scale as well as the standard bathrobes. The one thing that seems to be missing in the USA Fairmonts is in-room tea and coffee. They should make this service standard across the chain and provide tea and coffee.There were some service faults. The President's Club Platinum amenity never showed. Called at 5pm and they said they would deal with it. Called at 7:30pm and told them that as I was going to dinner and leaving the next day the amenity would be rather pointless and asked if they would offer breakfast instead鈥?鈥漺ell get back to you鈥? Returned at 11pm and no message. Called and breakfast was accommodated but there was no message about it, we started from square one. I don鈥檛 think that this is 5 star service. Shoeshine was done and during the day as per my request.The fitness centre and pool are excellent, the hot tub is huge and both pool and hot tub are under a glass dome, located on the second floor 鈥?very nice. They did have complimentary coffee/tea poolside until 11am and bottled water was available gratis from the attendant. 6 treadmills (3 had skipping belts though), 3 ellipticals, 2 recumbents and one stationary bike plus a stepper and weights. All cardio equipment has a personal TV and you are given headphones.Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent, very good quality including fresh berries and other fruits. Lunch was good but, the waiter forgot the salad 鈥?how do you do that? Again, should not happen in this quality of hotel restaurant. The serving process is also different than in Canada. The busboys there serve stuff and clearly should not as they don鈥檛 have a clue, like pouring tea 30 seconds after they put in the tea bag. Anyways, it was fine, just not 5 star in my mind.Would I come back, probably but I might be tempted over to the W Hotel Seattle which looks very nice. ',GOOD,
'An Anniversary Special Fairmonts are the special place to stay when you're NOT on expense but want to put out for something better. This 4 diamond property didn't disappoint at all. We drove down for out 5th wedding anniversary and were treated so well. Fairmonts don't have 'cheap' rates and for good reason; they do things right. They booked us a great table at Canlis ( one of the top places in Seattle) and then delivered an appetizer on the hotel, there were chocolate covered strawberries in the suite, top drawer service (as always), ending with fab home made chocolate chip cookies and milk for the drive home. The beds may not be westin but they're close and certainly overcome the rest of Westin's shortcomings.Basically, they were flawless and their attentiveness; something I expect from Fairmont and have not been let down by over the years. Parking, as anywhere in Seattle, was outrageous but that's the ante for playing. Believe the majority here. ',GOOD,
'Can't get excited! After reading the reviews on this website my expectations were high. The hotel didn't strike me as very architecturally interesting either inside or out. Surely not in the league of the Plaza in New York, or the Palace in San Francisco. Front desk didn't have a non-smoking room in our room category so we were downgrade to a regular room. The room was large but plain, with not much of a view.Hotel is not very user friendly, newspaper delivered on Saturday but not Sunday, no coffeemaker in the room, not much of a selection in the mini-bar. The most attractive public space, the Terrace Room is not available to guests, only private functions. The breakfast restaurant was empty, I guess the prices keep non expense account guests far away.As I said, can't get excited! ',POOR,

'great hotel and excellent staff Had an absolutely wonderful time last week at the Fairmont. Our room (the smallest suite) was just lovely and the amenities were all that we expected in a hotel of its type. And the architecture in the grand entrance was just beautiful.But what really made an impression on us was the staff. When we arrived at 3:30 our room was not yet ready -- as sometimes happens in a busy hotel. We had all our bags with us and must have looked pretty frazzled after 12 hours of travel. The desk clerk walked us over the bar and ordered us two drinks on the house while we waited. Maybe 30 minutes later our room was ready -- but we were no longer feeling so anxious to get to it as we felt our vacation had finally begun. For the next few days the Fairmont treated us like our stay in Seattle was as important to them as it was to us. Highly recommend the Seattle Fairmont and plan to stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Nothing beats the Fairmont Olympic So the question arises, does it live up to the hype of being the #1 hotel in Seattle?Answer is yes. All of the luxuries you expect from a hotel are at the Fairmont. Whether its free internet, terry cloth robes, slippers, flatscreen TVs on all of the treadmills and bikes or whatever, this place has it all. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are nicely decorated. Its quiet. What stands out even more than the amenities is the staff. Each staff member greets you and most remember you by name or say a simple welcome back when you reenter the hotel. The staff opened doors, elevators and the concierge desk was helpful even when they were bombarded by calls and people.I've been at some really nice hotels that try to pull all of the stops and the Fairmont Olympic truly does fit the bill as the nicest hotel in Seattle. ',GOOD,
'It's the tops! We stayed at the Fairmont Olympic before boarding a Holland America cruise to Alaska and it was a wonderful beginning to the trip. The hotel is beautiful and service was great from the check-in to check-out. Our room was hugh and the ammenities in the room and bath was wonderful (although the mini bar prices are very high). The decor was above average for even the best hotels, and the breakfast in the main dining room was simply the best meal I have ever had in a hotel. The service in the dining room was also impecable. I hope to return to Seattle and will definetly stay at the Olympic again. Even the location was great. Shuckers restaurant is actually located in the downstairs of the hotel (side entrance) and the food there was great - although I do not think the restaurant is actually run by the hotel. But for great fresh Seattle seafood - that restaurant can't be beat either. ',GOOD,
'Best in Seattle The Olympic is the nicest hotel in Seattle, if you are visiting Seattle and it fits your budget this is where to stay. Location is ideal for sightseeing downtown and the accomodations, restaurants, and service are absolutely first class. I've stayed at a few downtown Seattle luxury hotels over the years and this is clearly the best. Food is great at the restaurants and you are treated very nicely here. If every hotel was like this the world would be a better place. ',GOOD,
'Excellent! Just returned from our stay at the Fairmont Olympic in Seattle. Everything was superb, especially the service! Very friendly and accomodating staff. Beautiful hotel, large comfortable well-appointed rooms, good gym/exercise facilities. Downtown location convenient to all. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants, so cannot comment on dining. Drinks were a bit pricey (although not compared to NYC). Highly recommended - my wife and I travel extensively and are very discerning customers. ',GOOD,
'Never felt so Pampered This is a wonderful and classy hotel. The location is so central in downtown Seattle. The rooms are large and well appointed. The fitness center is wonderful and provides waterbottles. The machines have CD players and headphones for your pleasure or you can watch television while you exercise. The turn down service was exquisite. I have never stayed at a better hotel. ',GOOD,
'Wow!!! The service was wonderful!!! The Fairmont was just lovely. A young man by the name of Nicholas Jacobson parked my Mercedes as I pulled up to the hotel. Nick was very careful with my car, and he even took the time to vacuum out my car, and wax it while it was in the valet garage. The hotel was lovely. The room and bed was quite plush. I ordered a cheeseburger at 10:00 P.M. and it was delivered to my room at 10:08 P.M. by none other than that Nick J. who was working room service that night. He took the time to salt my fries for me, and he also applied a healthy amount of ketchup to my burger.As I departed the following day, I was delighted to see that smiling Nick pulling up my Benz. He advised me that I was a quart low on oil, and that my rear left tire was 1 pound low on air. He reset my trip odometer for me, and already adjusted my air conditioning to a perfect temperature!!!WHAT A HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!! ',GOOD,
'Excellent Service I stayed at the Fairmont Olympic for a small celebration. I live in Seattle so I just wanted some place swanky and fun. I'd been there before a couple of times when it was the Four Season's Olympic but this was my first visit since the switch.Service was great and incredibly sincere (which is rare). Nearly everyone I encountered was friendly, kind and upbeat. It didn't seem at all fakey, they just seemed to actually enjoy their jobs. The whole reason I booked with them (instead of some other local hotels) was the positive attitude of their assistant front desk manager (I think that was his title, sorry if I got it wrong) Steve, he was just really nice to me and made me feel truly welcome.The room was really big and comfortable with two tvs and French doors. I especially liked the seating area. I enjoyed having a couch, desk and armchair more than I thought I would. The bathroom was quite lovely with recently redone marble interior (had a hard time getting the tub to stay pluuged though, for a bath, the stopper kept popping out). Nice extras included bathrobes, umbrella, hairdryer, slippers, a loofah, emery board and cleaning cloth for glasses, complimentary shoeshine.The pool area and exercise facility were attractive and well appointed. Highlights include an amazing hottub and a sorta zen-type waterfall into the pool. I just wish it had been deeper than 4 feet.Negatives: The linens and bed could be improved. The sheets were nice but not outstanding and I guess that's what I was expecting. My bed at home is about as comfy (and my bed isn't that great).The Sheraton definitely beats them in the bed dept.Also, we ordered room service at 11pm and my order was confirmed, The order arrived at about midnight (after 20-30min. promise time). One of our meals was missing and instead of apologizing the waiter said that he wasn't aware that we had ordered two meals. Even though there were two desserts. He was fairly snotty and didn't even offer to rush it. My meal was the one that was forgotten and it finally arrived at 12:45am. It was cold and missing it's onion rings. (Cheeseburger) I ate it anyway and didn't say anything then because I had low blood sugar and I was starving! It wasn't good though and it sucked to not actually eat dinner at the same time as my boyfriend. Enjoyed the option of purchasing Playstation 2 games ($6.99 for two hours). However it would have been a lot more fun if two people could play against each other and not have to take turns. Also, they needed more recent games, Spiderman was the newest one they had and that came out years ago. The nice woman at the reception desk did take off the cost of half the room service order when I checked out. I guess that was good but it still made the night less than special. Also their beautiful Garden room is now only open for special events and not for dining. That's truly sad as it's a lovely place to go for tea. Beautiful vegetation and waterfalls. Very restful and pleasant. I really hope they reopen that room for the public. ',GOOD,
'The Most Fantastic Hotel in Seattle We stayed at the Fairmont in Seattle on New Year's Eve, and I've intended to write a review for months.....better late than never! This is truly an incredible place. The service is beyond belief. Everyone knocks themselves out to make your stay memorable. We did the multi course dinner on New Year's Eve. The food was great, and the music was even better! We danced our way into the New Year, and I don't recall when we've had so much fun. I have no complaints at all..........just praise. By the way, if you're heading to Seattle travel on over to The Fairmont Empress in Victoria which is equally delightful. We took the Victoria Princess which is a pleasant short boat trip to Victoria. Thanks to all Fairmont employees everywhere for the exquisite stays. Hoping to return to Seattle this summer, and I'll be back! Fairmonts are expensive but worth every penny you spend. I've never left a Fairmont *anywhere* disappointed. You check out refreshed and sorry to leave. ',GOOD,
'Worth every penny 鈥?a fantastic stay My fianc茅e and I were very happy with our stay at the Fairmont Olympic. In town for a friend鈥檚 wedding, everything was handled with the high level of service that I have come to expect from the Fairmont chain. Location is central, easy walking distance to most of the main Seattle attractions. The property itself is beautiful, a hotel with all of the old detail that takes you back in time. The lobby is phenomenal and has both a restaurant and a bar with ample seating. Once upstairs, we were amazed at the size of our room. Truly living in the lap of luxury for the weekend. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel The Fairmont is an incredible hotel in downtown Seattle. The service is attentive and caring - every detail was observed to perfection. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'Lovely hotel with great service! This is a really special place for anyone with an appreciation for history and architecture. That said, it's been fully modernized and has all the touches you'd expect from a top tier hotel, just with a lot of addedd charm. From the lobby to the rooms, it is incredibly well decorated. There is a nice bar off the lobby, and many dining and shopping choices within easy walking distance.This is one of those hotels where it's so nice you don't want to leave the room. ',GOOD,
'Really a cut above. Exemplary service and attention to detail. After our pre-Alaska cruiseship stays this past summer at the Banff Springs, Lake Louise  Vancouver Fairmont hotels, we were expecting service and accomodations to have diminished after it changed management from Four Seasons. In this case the property has actually been enhanced since Fairmont took it over. However, whatever they are doing / (have done), this is one Fairmont unlike any other we have visited. Kudos all around, (especially to the staff and improvements to the rooms and public areas). We'll be back as soon as we can find an excuse to visit that beautiful part of the world again. ',GOOD,
'if you can afford it, hard to beat Stayed there several times when was a 4Seasons, and once since became a Fairmont.Lovely property, almost a bit overdone (as 4seasons tend to be).Fantastic oyster restaurant on the property - Shuckers.Great location, walking downtown area.Great rooms, great service. Main drawback is that it's also one of the most expensive properties in town, and for the money, might want to look at unique Seattle properties like the EdgeWater. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Hotel with wonderful service Beauttiful hotel with old school charm. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in late November. We arrived late and the check-in process went very smoothly. We were upgraded to a large executive suite that was well appointed. The robes came in handy as well as the down comforter as the temperatures were a bit chilly compared to Florida. The hotel was decorated for the holidays and made us feel in the spirit for post Thanksgiving holiday shopping and made for a cozy environment. Room service was spotty. They screwed up the order on two occasions. One time they totally forgot to bring the order, but rushed an order to us which still was not what we ordered entirely, but they graciously did not charge us for it. I went to the spa, which was rather small, but quiet and relaxing. This hotel is in a super location, within walking distance to all the action and they offer a complimentary sedan for trips under 2 miles away. The staff are very helpful, address you by name and the service overall is very good. I would stay in this hotel again. ',GOOD,
'Classic hotel with first rate service. A beautiful, old world hotel (historic building) in a great location. We had roomy, well appointed suite with a fold out couch for our 8 year old and our bed behind draped French doors. The room was like an apartment (large). Service touches were exceptional (they even gave our daughter a card to call room service for free milk and cookies that were sent up on a plate with her name on it) and the staff was extremely pleasant and professional. An easy walk to shopping, dining, and the Pike St. Market Place. Indoor pool with large hot tub and adjacent work out equipment were very nice. All sorts of different complimentary newspapers to choose from. Great concierge staff. A superior vacation spot for my family. I look forward to another stay at The Fairmont Olympic Hotel ',GOOD,
'Worth Every Bit The service here from top to bottom is excellent. Everyone is professional and has a good attitude. Kudos to the person managing all these terrific people. The room was a corner room with wonderful water and city views. Thank you for letting me know that great hotels like this exist. I'll be looking for Fairmont hotels in all my travels. ',GOOD,
'Can't be beat Frequent traveller so I know good - no - great service when I see it. This hotel has it all. Best service of ANY hotel I've stayed in. Without exception, every person you come into contact at this hotel will impress.Used to stay at Sorrento - but like this location, lobby, restaurants, fitness center and rooms better.This hotel has it all. Close to everything; comfortable, spacious rooms; incredible fitness center w/ every amenity possible, impressive lobby and truly accommodating staff.Restaurants are great - gorgeous main dining room or the cozy Oyster bar @ Shuckers. Hotel pays close attention to every single little detail. It's the only place to stay in Seattle. ',GOOD,

'positive Stayed here over the Xmas new year period 08/09 with two adult children. very good choice for us. Centrally located with MTR across the street, local supermarket nearby and bus and tram stop close.rooms very clean and housekeeping very helpful at any hour. Front office and other staff happy to oblige. only down side was the breakfast buffet, never seemed to get it right each time but they tried. Would suggest breakfasting elsewhre many local cafes available or jump on MTR to Causeway Bay, beauty salon expensive , better off heading into Causeway Bay but for convenience sake we tried and couldn't fault the service. several eating options available and happy hour after 5. reasonable rates. ',POOR,
'Cheap  A good  cheap transportation via TVR to this Hotel but it is a long way from Central. Great rate but the bed was so hard we could not sleep in it for the first night and I was glad we only stayed two nights in it( I got extra towels in to sleep on to help soften the mattress) because there was no extra bedding we could use supplied in the room and we were quite cold on the first night. For the price we paid the Hotels facilities were very adequate though. ',POOR,
'Good hotel, good location We really liked the location of the Harbour Plaza - it is not in the middle of the tourist areas of HK and gives you a better chance to see the real HK. The MTR and the Tram stops are close to the hotel and they take you everywhere. North Point with its wonderful wet market is 5 min by Tram and Causeway Bay and Central are only 10-15 Min away.We had a room with a partial harbour view. The room was spacious and clean - housekeeping did a good job.The pool was one of the largest I have ever seen in a city hotel - not many guests were using it, so I had it mostly on my own.The supermarket opposite of the hotel is open until 11 pm - no need to pay for the expensive mini bar items.I would love to stay at this hotel again on our next trip to HK. ',GOOD,
'Absolutely fine We have just returned from 11 nights in Hong Kong - 8 of those staying at the Harbour Plaza North Point. After changing rooms because we initially had a smoking room we found the new room to perfectly suit our needs. Our two girls (aged 9 and 7) slept on the sofa bed in the living room whilst my husband and I had a separate bedroom - with its own TV. The room had a separate little kitchen although strangely no utensils as we were not long term tenants.There is a supermarket across the road so you don't need to eat in restaurants all the time if you don't want to. The pool was fantastic - it is not often you see a 25m pool in a hotel and the gym was well equipped. The hotel provides regular free shuttle buses to the local shopping malls and the MTR train station is about 100m from the hotel entrance. Yes, I agree with other reviews that it is a little way out but with the MTR being so efficient it doesn't really matter. HK Island is definitely better to stay on than Kowloon. The staff were friendly although they needed a better area displaying local tourist attractions as the concierges were a little limited in their English to fully answer our questions. Overall and good hotel providing value for money. ',GOOD,

Could not fault anything about the Harbour Plaza North Point.Room was spacious  clean, had a partial harbour view which was great even on the 10th floor. All staff were very friendly and went out of their way with service or help.Travelled everywhere on MTR , which is just across the road from the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Problem rooms? Harbour Plaza North Point is a perfectly good 3 star hotel. However, I'm downgrading it in my review because I was initially allocated a room which was obviously damp and musty. When I complained I was allocated another room - exactly the same but dry.I've no idea whether this is an isolated incident for this hotel, but it impacts on my ability to recommend this hotel, as had occupancy been higher I may have been stuck with an unacceptable room.The facilities and common areas were of the standard you would expect from a hotel in this class. ',POOR,
'Great value hotel I stayed at this hotel for 14 days while visting family in Hong Kong, and i thought the hotel was fantastic. My parents and i had a family suite which had partial views of the harbour, the room was a great size with a small kitchen, dinning table, TV, shower room, double bedroom and a single bed in the living room. Even although we had a single bed and a sofa bed in the living room there was still plently of space.The towels in the room got changed everyday and our maid was a great help, even although she couldn't speak any English she still managed to fix any problems(shower got blocked on first day) we had quickly.There is nothing much around the hotel as it seems to be more a residential area, however there is a great supermarket just across the road and also a McDonalds and Pizza Hut nearby for convenience. It is extremely easy to get around the city, taxis are VERY cheap and are readly available outside the hotel. The Quarry Bay MTR station is across the road from the hotel and again is a very quick, easy and cheap way to travel around the city (around 30p for 5 stops).Recommended sites: PoLin Monestry and Budda (get MTR to Tung Chung and then cable car to the village)Tram upto peak where there is great views over the harbour, go at night to see the building lights being switched on.Hong Kong disneyland, altough not as good or as big as the Orlando one it is still a great day out. Only around 拢2.50 to travel on MTR from hotel to the resort!!!Visit Happey Valley Racecourse. The racing season was finished when we visited but iv been told it is a great night out.Visit Macau and the fantastic Venetian Macau hotel.Visit Lan Kwai Fong, where there are many great restaurants and bars.I had a great time in Hong Kong and will definetely visit again and i will stay at this hotel again too. ',GOOD,
'Great value This is a very pleasant hotel with great harbour views from many rooms. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a suite room on the top floor, which was very nice!There's nothing much in the local vicinity of the hotel, but it is right near the Quarry Bay MTR so getting in and out is pretty convenient. ',GOOD,
'good well priced hotel IF you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel then I would recommend this hotel I stayed there for two nights the rooms are large the bed is a bit hard but otherwise the room is bright and modern . The hotel caterers for mainly tour groups so the lobby can be a bit congested at times . It has easy access to the underground system I paid 850 hk per night which I consider very reasonable for HK ',GOOD,
'It's ok, but       View of harbour from our room ',POOR,
'OK but not recommended Let's just say that it is clean hotel. Close to MTR (subway), supermarket Wellcome, Mc Donalds, that's all.Location wise, not very convenient, the closest mall would be Tai Koo by tram, and to go to Causeway Bay would be pretty far by HK standard.The reason I stayed here because all the other hotels were fully booked at the time within my price range. So would I recommend it, well only if you can't find other hotels in the last minute for the Hong Kong side hotels. I guess more hotels in Kowloon side. As what other contributor said, yes it is located beside a funeral house, unless you are superstitious then better don't stay here but luckily I'm not, and the hotel is quite full of guests by the way.

'Very Good I had a good deal in this hotel through Expedia. It was all worth it,great room space in HK standards, very clean, healpfull and generous staff. Simply, it's all what you can ask for.Like any other thing in life, it's not perfect. The only drawback i can find on this hotel is its location. It's quite far from city center and from where all the fun is.( which means gonna make you pay extra for transportaion within HK), although it is less than a minute walk to the MTR station. ',GOOD,
'Solid, but unspectacular I stayed here for a week on business in April 2008 and found the hotel to be a decent hotel in a pretty convenient location in HK. It's certainly not in the thick of Central or Kowloon, but a short subway ride from anywhere. We chose this because it was close to our meetings--otherwise you may want to look elsewhere. The rooms are pretty small, but clean and well-kept. However, the beds are as hard as nails...ouch. Also, there's no wireless internet. The gym is decent, but light on weights. The hotel has a nice breakfast buffet, but the food in the restaurant overall is quite average. ',POOR,
'Above average stay We stayed at the Harbour Plaza North Point for one night at the beginning of April 08.The check in staff weren't particularly friendly nor welcoming however the concierge was very helpful in recommending things to do, places to see and places to eat. The room we got was nice and clean, it had a big shower and all the toiletries and amenities you could expect from a 4 star hotel, including toothbrushes and toothpaste. Bed was hard, but I understand that's the norm in asia which we were able to confirm throughout our 2 week trip around chinaOur room had a small kitchenette and there was a bowl of fruit waiting for us upon arrival. It is true that there is nothing interesting close to the hotel, however the hotel is less than 100 mts away from an MTR station, and it'll take only about 10 minutes to get to Central by MTR. The tram also stops just in front of the hotel so transport links are very convenient. There is a Seven eleven and a number of smaller shops to the left of the hotel past the funeral house and right opposite to the hotel you'll find a small supermarket and a Cafe de Coral restaurant which serves nice chinese food and seems to be quite popular as you'll find it all over HK including Terminal 1 at the airport.Overall this hotel was nice. It was nothing particularly special but for the price you do get good quality accommodation and ok service. ',GOOD,
'Location poor I wouldn't stay at this hotel simply because of its location.It is just besides the famous Hong Kong Funeral parlor鈥? For all those who never been to Hong Kong, it's fine. For those who are in Hong Kong for a long time, we all know what that location means. No matter how good it is or how cheap it is. I wouldn't stay there.I believe you don't want to see all types of funeral during your trip. ',POOR,
'A Brief Stay at the Harbour Plaza       Local street market near hotel ',GOOD,
'Clean room and efficient service My first impression was that the lobby staff were highly efficient and professional. Btw this is Hong Kong so don't expect the same warmth and friendliness that you normally get in other Asian cities like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta or Bangkok. But I wouldn't rate them badly for this coldness as efficiency can be a very welcome trait for a harried traveler. Just manage your expectations to suit their local culture and you'll be fine.A warning though, there is no free breakfast offered. There is a breakfast buffett but this will cost you. I've never stayed in a hotel where there's no free breakfast service before so I felt I was being ripped off. They also took their time with my luggage. I was wanting to carry up my suitcase myself but they *insisted* on taking it. So fine. It was close to midnight and I was tired so I let them, not expecting it to be a problem. All I wanted to do was shower, change and sleep. But because they took my luggage, I ended up sitting in my room with the same clothes on as I was wearing on the flight for 20 minutes before they finally delivered my suitcase. I don't get the logic of this. If this happens to you, insist to carry your own luggage up! There's lifts to every floor so there's no problem at all logistically. At first I thought this was the way for them to squeeze a tip from the guest. So I had my money out when the knock came but the guy who brought it in turned tail out the door without even pausing. So its not the tip then? *scratches head*Apart from this minor annoyance, my stay was good in overall. The good: The room was clean and neat. Good sized bathroom. Comfortable beds. Cable television. A view of the harbour. Effficient and professional staff. In the room, there is an electric kettle to boil water with. The bad: No free wifi. No free breakfast. Strange insistence to take my bags when I checked in was a waste of my time. ',GOOD,
'decent hotel but far from anything I went to Hong Kong as part of a study abroad program. I would not have chosen this hotel if I was making the arrangements because of the location. I prefer a hotel in a more central location so that I can walk to restaurants, bars and shops. The hotel itself is clean and decent looking. The breakfast is good and has plenty of options. The rooms are clean, the beds are twin size and a little hard but plenty of pillows. There is internet access but you have to ask for the wire. The metro is a half a block away and is safe to use. The taxis are very reasonable to get around. We used the conference room there and it was a good size, clean and they had tea, coffee, and things to nosh on. I hope this helps ',POOR,
'Great value for a Hong Kong Island Hotel This was my second stay here and I find it good value for money in a conveneient location.The Harbour Plaza is 6 km from Central but is ideally located for public transport with the tram right outside the door and the MTR just a block away. They also have a free bus to Central every hour. But because it is away from the Central, the prices are much lower than an equivalent hotel located in Central.Staying on the Island is much quieter than in Kowloon and as half the attractions are on the Island I think it is the better place to stay.The breakfasts are great but expensive if not included in the tariff. In fact everything is expensive if not included. Be sure to look for an offer that includes breakfast. Avoid the minibar - even the local water is $US5 a bottle - most hotels provide complimentary local water.The rooms are small but well equipped with a view (glimpse) of the harbour. ',GOOD,
'Consistently good. We paid around AUD$130 per night for this hotel in a superior harbour view room, and it proved to be excellent value. Some people may be a little put off by its location, which is about 10-15mins away on the MTR from central Hong Kong. I wouldn鈥檛 worry too much about it 鈥?the MTR is one of the world鈥檚 best public transport systems 鈥?easy to use, cheap, reliable and efficient. Getting into town wasn鈥檛 too much of a hassle at all.The rooms are a little small, but not too bad by Hong Kong standards - especially for the price. The room was spotless, the bathroom was a good size, and quality fittings were used. There was enough storage space in the room for 2 people to completely unpack their luggage for 5 days. The staff members were consistently good 鈥?everyone we encountered (barring one ill-mannered waiter in the restaurant) was professional, friendly and courteous. Sometimes they were a little too business-like, but I didn鈥檛 mind that too much. You really got the impression that they were on top of everything at this well run, efficient establishment. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel restaurant (called Greens) and while the d茅cor of the restaurant was a little lackluster, the food was good, and offered pretty good value. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for great value accommodation in Hong Kong. ',GOOD,
'Rude booking staff. Hotel next to Hong Kong Funeral Home I called the hotel on 29th Oct to book a serviced apartment for my trip in Nov. The staff, Yvonne Lee promised to send me an email. I never receive it. The following day, I called the room reservation as I found out there was long stay promotion which suited me as I only stay for 3 weeks. I called IDD from Singapore. The reservation staff, Annie put me on hold for 3 times and each time for minutes. Finally, another staff, Cherry answered the phone. I told her I never receive any email information and about Annie. Cherry promised to email me information on long stay price. Guess what? Never email me!By the way, Harbour Plaza North Point is next to Hong Kong Funeral Home. Good for Halloween celebration!I finally booked with Kornhill Apartments which is near Taikooshing. The staff is very polite and helpful and booking process is easy.why pay more and suffer when you can pay less and enjoy? Don't go to Harbour Plaza and sleep with ghosts. ',POOR,
'Go somewhere else! I made my booking at this hotel directly from the hotel website. I had opted for a harbor view room but I was given a room that they refer to as hill facing. I called up, visited the reservation desk regarding this but to no avail. Finally, they changed my room some 10 hours after my arrival after I had expressed enough displeasure about all this. Below are a few things that I would like to share:* The rooms were tiny with barely any space to even walk.* The shower cabinet was so small that you would invariably bump yourself against the walls no matter how straight you stand while taking a shower.* I have never experienced so much noise inside a hotel room. Even with the television on inside the room, the sound of people walking in the aisle could be heard loud enough inside the room. Moreover, noise from adjacent floors was also fairly apparent.* Even though the hotel is close to MTR Quarry Bay Station, there no markets nearby that you can walk up to.* Requests for wake up calls are ignored.My suggestion would be to opt for some other hotel. This one is horribly expensive if you look at the pain points (even otherwise it is very expensive). ',POOR,
'Great Value Excellent value for money and a good general experience. If you want a good hotel at the right price then this is for you. If you want 5* luxury then go to the Peninsula. The breakfast was excellent and the rooms comfortable. Service was good and room service very quick. All our requirements were dealt with quickly including special diets and a late arrival and departure. No problems at all for us. Shop around for the best price we did and got a deal for a free breakfast. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Place I wanted a one-bedroom suite at a good price and great quality and I found it at Harbour Plaza Noth Point. It is a 3.5 to 4.0 star quality (closer to a 4 star). I sense that the staff was constantly trying to do things to make the hotel 4start+. The one-bedroom suite is very large for Hong Kong and comfortably sleeps 2 adults and 2 kids. The sofa in the living room is a fold-open bed for the 2 kids. They did NOT charge us extra for that. there is also a small dinner area with dinning table and a small kitchen with microwave and stove and fridge BUT no silverware NOR plates. The staff is CONSTANTLY cleaning and wiping the lobby coffee tables as soon as the guest leaves. The staff are extremely friendly. To maintain quality look to the hotel the manager discreetly and politely suggested to me to upgrade my sloppy attire in the lobby area (since I spent plenty of mornings in the lobby using my notebook). My one bedroom suite is very large and it has a spectacular view of the the ocean and Kowloon. The pool is well maintained, large, and pleasant. The hotel is NOT in the busy tourist Causeway Bay area but it is very close to the MTR (subway station) and trolley station. I eat at the Cafe De Corale fast food chain that is within walking distance from the hotel (almost across the street) every morning for breakfast. Excellent western and eastern breakfast for about $2.25US. I did a lot of web-based and travel agency research before I went to Hong Kong and this hotel's one-bedroom suite is best priced and I was definitely VERY pleasantly surprised. ',GOOD,
'Just the right spot Yesterday we returned from Hong Kong. Now we can't wait to go back there. It took until the final day when we realised just what a good position the hotel is in, after shopping in Admiralty area we tried to get onto the MTR, whilst the Chinese were trying to go home (Friday feeling!), they were climbing up our backs, so I had to yell that there was a child below who was getting squashed!!! Yes the HPNP, may be a little out of the way, but this means you will get a seat on the MTR. Also being away from Admiralty means that the shop prices are cheaper, Ad is full of Daks, Prada, Armarni etc...The hotel was fabulous, the staff (mostly) were warm and friendly, and very patient... well we did have Sam with us, eight years old and with a Chinese game for his DS... the guest relations were particularly kind. Greens the restaurant for breakfast most days and we used them for dinner, every other evening. The prices were not bad, and the food was delicious. We did not try the Hoi Yat Feen as we had taken a wrong turn out of the pool and the staff were quick to pounce... put us off a little.MTR opposite, over the crossing, as is Wellcome a mini-mart. It is amazing how clean Hong Kong is, even through the Typhoon, efficiency is number one. Stores have many staff to help you, and it is actually hard to spend your money. DisneyLand is terrific, and you can get a meal for three for about 拢8 English! DLand is very small, and before 11am is empty, then they arrive and the place is heaving. Buy your ponchos at the gate, three for about 拢6. Tshirts are less that a tenner, but be warned, the sizes are Asian, ie, a man who is normally a medium becomes XL, not good for the mind, and the Hard Rock Cafe is even tighter! On this aspect Florida is better if you are heavier as then you look sylph-like next to the Yanks, but an effalump next to the petite Chinese.The worst part of our holiday was that the old men walk around with their shirts up around their chest, showing off their tummies, no-one was seen to 'hockle' in thei streets, but go to the toilets and you hear it all come up, especially in the Ladies.No, seriously the worst part was coming home... we had travelled with Oasis HongKong and the flight over from Gatwick was fabulous. Returning to UK, there was no meal but a bag of crisps for my son... and we had paid extra! Then the flight was sent to Stansted because of fog, yet no other flights were... then we sat on the ground for three hours to find out we were not going to Gatwick after all, then... we had to wait another hour for bags to be unloaded, then another half an hour to find a coach to get us to Gatwick, then a two hour journey. The upshot was we got to Gatwick with a 7 1/2 hour delay... and no refreshments were offered either. This totally put the holiday into the black with memories. We were not amused and now waiting to find out what Oasis are going to do about it. PLUS... the dog has had to stay in the kennels another night, AND the house key was missing from the car after we left it at the airport and hubby has had to break in!Overall we would love to go back to Hong Kong, and we would definitely stay at Harbour Plaza North Point, no closer as there is the overcrowding risk! BUT we would travel with another operator.Hope you enjoy reading this review, but promise me you will visit the Peak (great Bubba Gump), Buddha on Lantau, worth the stressful stairs!, Outback restaurants, especially Nathan Rd, Hard Rock, Canton Rd (behind Nathan), visit the Jade market, and pay no more than a third of their required price, walk away, they will run after you!!! Go for the bargains, and visit Roger the tailor on Nathan Rd (Manhattan Tailor), for excellent service, even if you don't buy he will give you a free can of cold pop! The Peak is fantastic, we spent more than four hours up there. The trams are nowt to write about, and the Chinese don't like tattoos so there is more reason to have a seat on the MTR, they will avoid you. They love small blonde haired, blue eyed boys and my son still has the bruises on his cheeks to prove it, he is so embarrassed. Addition: you must visit Ocean Park, but take your Disney poncho, and queue up to see the pandas first, leave the rides till last, and go on the hot air balloon second. ',GOOD,
'Great Value - Highly Recommended A great 8 day stay.Booked our stay direct on the hotels website.Got a fantastic deal staying in a 'Harbour Club' junior suite. Plenty of space in the room including fridge, microwave and cooking facilities.Rooms were very clean and well looked after by the friendly staff.Our deal included Broadband internet access (but remember your lap-top !), Complimentary mini-bar, 1 x Buffet Bkfst per day, Complimentary happy hour in hotel bar plus extras.I am astonished by the previous negative comments on this hotel, I can only assume these are from people who stayed in the cheaper rooms? (you get what you pay for)Compared to european hotel deals, this was very competitive.The hotel is located by the nearby Quarry Bay MTR station, approx 10 minutes from the busy area's of Causeway Bay  WanChai. The hotel also provides complimentary shuttle buses to both area's.Also nearby are a handy Supermarket, Cafe Coral (traditional HK cuisine), McDonalds, Pizza-Hut and then there's the very Impressive CitiPlaza Shopping Centre at Taikoo is just 5 minutes away by taxi. ',GOOD,
'Bad experience This hotel reckon that it have a 4 star rating, but in my opinion a 3 star rating would be generous.From the tiny room size to the indifferent services from the staff, to the really horrible experience such as blocked toilet, Shower head that wont stay up (even after I notify the service dept they did not do anything).They also tried to charge me for item from mini bar that I don't even touch. Strewth!! what nerve this people have!! Beware, you will get charged for a full day internet even if you just plug in the line and not do any internet activity. They said they charge 140 HKD for 24 hrs use or 4hkd /minute, but you will get charged a full day rate anyway. I think you will be best to try other place and save yourself troubles I experienced.Shame on you Harbor Plaza North Point !! Here is an unhappy customer that do talk to other. ',POOR,
'Great location for exploring Hong Kong Island My sister and I were staying for 14 nights in a one-bedroom suite. We have stayed in 3-4 stars hotels in Hong Kong previously, but we were very pleased with HPNP because of the good airconditioning, shower with lots of running water, kitchenette with microwave and fridge, harbour view, good lighting in the rooms and the convient location of the hotel. The Quarry Bay MTR station, the tram station and the A12 Cityflyer to and from the airport are within short walking distance. Equipped with an Octopus card, we could easily get around Hong Kong with the buses, trams and MTR. We were pleased with the hotel staff, and the door attendants and housekeeping were all polite and helpful. Staying here gives you the opportunity to explore parts of Hong Kong Island east of Causeway Bay. In Hong Kong the least of your problems is to find places to eat, but we enjoyed our take-aways in the dining room, in peace and quiet, after a long day of shopping! You can buy breakfast, lunch and dinner in Cafe de Coral or water, bread and juice in Wellcome across from the hotel. We will definately stay here again for our next Hong Kong getaway! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic trip We stayed for four nights at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in June 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic.The one bedroom suite is fabulous and great for the money.Its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite which is great.The staff were always helpful, plus on the day we were leaving they let us have our room for half a day extra at no charge.We enjoyed our stay at and will go there again 100% for sure! ',GOOD,
'Gobsmacked After a 14 hour flight and a short taxi ride we ended at the Harbour Plaza. Unfortunately our travel agent didn't realise there is more than one Harbour Plaza hotel in Hong Kong. We were booked in at the North Point - which after seeing the grandeur of the Flag Ship Harbour Plaza was a bit of a disappointment. That said it was fine for what it wasWe could sleep 2 adults and 2 kids to a room - so that was good and saved a bit of money as rooms are so expensive in HK.The buffet was good but expensive.The Porters were helpful and public transport was fun to navigate.Shops, Shops and more shopsOne of the things we wanted was a pool. The outdoor pool was freezing which was a disappointment - for the children in particular. They only managed a few minutes. It would have been great if they were able to spend more time in the pool after a day walking round. ',POOR,
'Good value for the money Stayed here as part of a convention with the HK Trade Development Council. The price was good, and service was also good. The room was a little dirty, but acceptable. Laundry service was very good but a little expensive. Had a room toward the bay, but the view was mostly of the Police station. Get a room on the upper floors and the view would be great. If I had to, I would stay here again, but the Excelsior is hard to beat. ',GOOD,
'Get a good rate or go elsewhere The rooms are nice and this hotel is acceptable as long as you get a really good rate. I did not get my wake up call and my messages never arrived, an issue with food making my guest sick and the pool was closed and due to open the day after I left with no consideration to allow entry the day before. It is a bit of a way from 'the action' of LKF/Central and Wanchai but the MTR is great. The supermarket opposite is a god send and there are some eaterys for breakkie nearby. Only if you get a good rate - try anything but definately do not pay rack rate - much better hotels closer to Central. G ',POOR,
'good value / money; small rooms; good location to subway My son  I had a double room while attending the Rugby 7s (March 30-April 1). We pricelined the room at 50% of suggested 4 star rate, and considering how everything doubles or trebles in price during the 7s, felt we got value. Small room, hard beds. No problems with internet. (hkd 140 / day).Hotel is very convenient to Quarry Bay Subway Exit C (200m) and we ate a great omlette breakfast every morning at Cafe de Coral in the same street for HKD 18 pp. Diagonally across from the McDonalds is a service laundry which washed  folded our clothes for HKD 35 (or the cost of one shirt with the hotel laundry).A small but serviceable fitness club with 2 treadmills, one cross trainer, a bicycle and a rowing machine. A few lifting stations and a stretching area. Gym ball and dumbell rack. Outdoor pool was closed until April 5.You won't entertain clients here, but a good tourist hotel. ',POOR,
'Need a serious refreshment The hotel looks good but rooms seriously need to be refreshed.Don't ask the front desk about internet connection as they have no idea about it works (even if it is written everywhere to ask them for there wireless connection...)The buffet is quite the same every night and as the hotel is not central you don't have many choices to eat around. ',POOR,
'Would pass on this one next time.... Stayed here for 2 days in mid-February 2007. I Pricelined the hotel, and the room was US$95 a night. A decent price for HK, but on the other hand the room I had on the 10th floor was very average. Staff was friendly and efficient. I went to nearby Coral Cafe for breakfast...clean, local, but decent food at a very reasonable price. The Quarry Bay MTR station is a 3 minute walk from the hotel, so that's a plus. But overall I'd not return. ',POOR,
'Best value in Hong Kong We stayed for a week at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in January 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was very positive.The hotel's location is way out in the suburbs on Hong Kong Island. Its immediate surroundings is mainly offices buildings and there are very few shops nearby. However, its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite and a Cafe de Coral (cheap meals) next to that. The hotel is 7 MTR stops from Central, about 12 - 15 minutes' travelling time.The one bedroom suite is fabulous value for money. It has a living/dining room, kitchenette, bedroom and generous bathroom. Unusually for a hotel room, there is stacks of cupboard space. The furnishings are quite tasteful, with the exception of a ghastly carpet pattern. Please, HPNP, do yourselves a favour and upgrade this! The staff were always helpful. When we complained of a bad smell in our initial room, we were promptly moved to a new room that was very satisfactory. We booked our room for about US$138 per night. This has to be about the best value anywhere in Hong Kong.A tip: Ignore the hotel laundry service. Go down the side street on the way to the MTR, and there are two laundries down there. We used one of them and paid HK$23 for up to seven pounds of laundry. Down the same street you'll find the most bakeries that produce fantastic rolls and buns that make a great breakfast, for absolute peanuts.We enjoyed our stay at HPNP and will go there again, for sure! ',GOOD,
'Very nice, good for the price, right on the MTR Very nice hotel, comfortable, very good service from the staff.The neighborhood is mostly local, not a tourist area, but the super-efficient MTR (subway) is 3 minutes walk away and whisks you anywhere in minutes. HINT: MTR stations have multiple exits, if you use the wrong one you might have a longish walk to your desitination. For this hotel, use Quarry Bay and remember exit C.It's not quite on the water, so while there is a harbor view from some rooms, it's only about 15% of the view, the rest is blocked by tall buildings. So if you choose to pay for the Harbor View upgrade, which is not very much, keep that in mind.Internet access was reliable but a bit pricy, about $20 US/day maximum, about 50c/min if you used less.The area contains many shops and restarants, just explore and you'll do fine. I found two breakfast places that serve buns with various meats, etc in them and so breakfast was about $1 US and very good. Though not everyone speaks English, it's amazing that when you find yourself trying to communicate with someone who doesn't, somene else will seemeingly come along and helpfully translate. HK folks are very much like that.Bottom line - a very nice hotel at a much lower price than others because it's a 10-minute subway ride away. ',GOOD,

'Enjoyed our stay The room was nice with a partial view of the harbour, we had a kitchenette, but no cutlery/crockery/sauce pans etc, which confused us for a day or so, until we turned the cardboard sign around and discovered the english side and found out they are available by a call to house keeping.The staff could speak english Ok and were always helpful.The location is a bit out in the suburbs, (which we liked) as it was good not to be hassled by hawkers while out and about.We had breakfast several times at the hotel and it was nice.We did not use the hotels laundry facilities, but each morning weleft our laundry at the Hung fung laundry (about a block away) and picked it up each afternoon/evening (3 peoples clothes for $28HK)washed, dried and neatly folded, it made our holiday all the better.MTR (Subway) is 100m away, and Island place and Taikoo place shopping centres are close and have food courts, were we mainly ate. Wellcome Supermarket is over the road, Pizza hut, McDonalds are a block away. ',POOR,
'surprisingly good We stayed here for one night on the way back from Eur to Au. There was a huge trade show on in HKK and everything was booked out or v expensive. Ended up here and were happy with it.Near the MTR, real location, very kind early check in and late check out (we were exhausted and desperate for a shower), pleasant staff.Small room, and not that cheap. Pool not bad. A long way to Kowloon by MTR or taxi. ',GOOD,
'Very convinient Very good location, just opposite the MTR (metro station).We stayed (me and my wife) at the top floor (33rd) and the view was amazing (harbour view).The room was very clean and the service above average, but the size of the room was small. ',GOOD,
'Never again Prior to arrival at this hotel we emailed to confirm room we booked and paid for had two beds, one for my wife and I and one for our teenage daughter. Email from hotel confirmed this was the case. On arrival we were given a small room with one double bed! After speaking to reception staff we were told we could have a room suitable for two beds (1 double plus a roll up) but we would have to pay an extra $800 australian dollars. We were booked for 7 nights and had already paid approx $A1800. Protests were met with a shrug of the shoulder and a comment that hotel rooms in HK were very small.Being late on a Sunday night we agreed to accept placement of a roll up bed in the room which made moving around extremely difficult and uncomfortable. We attempted to change the situation the following day without any success. Saying that the 'harbour view' we were promised was a glimpse would be generous.. Housekeeping/Concierge/door staff were nice but even so we had to request a third towel daily together with other essentials like toilet paper!! I could go on about other shortcomings. ',POOR,
'Great Hotel We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was very clean and nicely furnished and would easily accomodate 2 adults and 3 children. There is an MTR station across the road with easy access to the rest of Hong Kong; the journey to Central takes about 10 minutes. There is a supermarket opposite,if you need to stock up the fridge in the room. We did not explore the vicinity surrounding the hotel so I have no idea what it has to offer. I would definately recommend this hotel as a good base to explore Hong Kong. ',GOOD,

'Great time at the Rembrandt I stayed on the Rembrandt for 5 nights on April 2007, and the experience was really wonderful. We had tremendous luck regarding the weather - sunny most of the time, and it didn't rain for the our whole stay. The hotel was extremely well situated, a few block from the Dam in one direction and from Anne Frank's house in the other. You can also walk to central station from there, though it would be like a 15/20 minute walk. It was a really nice place, quiet at night and a few steps from the crowds during the day, and our room faced the channel (ask for it !). Nice rooms (fair size), pretty clean and a very good breakfast, plus a really great staff. I will come back to Amsterdam (love that city!), and definetely will stay on the Rembrandt again. ',GOOD,
'Just Great! This hotel was a godsend to stay at, although it wasn't the easiest hotel to get to via the tram (we parked at one of the autoparkades by the Stadium). A taxi can get you to the front door, however.We shared a large room with another couple and the room was spectacularly large, the beds were wonderfully comfortable and we had a lovely view of the canals in front.The room ended up being quite affordable ($125 per night, per couple) but we booked through hotels.ca. This location is wonderfully central to much that you would want to do in Amsterdam and we cannot recommend this place more. The staff were very courteous and knowledgeable. Some of the floors, however, can be difficult to navigate for the elderly or the disabled since there are many levels and stairs throughout, so if this is a concern, please be careful about which room you get.The breakfast, however, is way too expensive but there are some decent bistros nearby (though even these can be tricky to find). ',GOOD,
'Brill stay ! Stayed here for four nights, fantastic stay, hotel was clean and the staff more than helpful. The room was adequate not over large but fine loads of hot water fantastic baths every night which is essential because the amount of walking during the day one needs a hot bath at night. The room was very clean and modern only thing missing a kettle but that's not unusual on the continent. This hotel is in a fantastic location just right as Amsterdam is a place for walking. Had a great time and would really recommend this hotel, pity the bar closes at 10.30 ! not to worry so many bars nearby. Amsterdam is certainly worth the trip a truly beautiful chilled out city. ',GOOD,
'Great location We stayed at Hotel Rembrandt Centrum last March. The location is great. Near Dam Square and not far from the Centraal Station.Our room was large, clean and with view to a canal.The people at reception were friendly and always ready to give infomations about the city. ',GOOD,
'Potentially lovely: beautiful location but inside rather grubby and disappointin Great location, huge room (3 double beds) everything else dire; cramped, mildew-ridden bathroom (but with a great shower - if you are 3 foot tall), generally quite grubby. Check-in took 40 minutes and we were then given keys to a room already occupied. V. embarrassing. The building and canalside location are stunning but our room was at the back, over looking an internal well, (as I think most are) we didn't benefit from this.We will definitely come back to this area, but not this hotel. Also, it was certainly not cheap and for that money I do expect at least cleanliness. ',POOR,

'Location, location and again location+value for money My second time in Amsterdam (first one was 15 years ago) and both times stayed at the Rembrandt Centrum, difference was all for better, this time I ordered single room, and got double room at the same price, asked for canal view and got it, in general room was very clean, cleaned every day , polite staff and answered the need of staying in Amsterdam at a centrally located hotel. two blocks from Dam square and yet quiet street.I payed about 130 $ per night and it deffinetlly justifies the price. ',GOOD,
'Great location We spent 2 nights at the Rembrandt and found it to be comfortable and clean and in a fantastic location. It was quietly situated but within easy reach of everything we needed. Our rate included breakfast and a boat trip and staff were friendly and helpful. The room wasn't huge but for a 3* hotel in a central location it was great. We would definitely stay again. ',GOOD,
'Be happy to go there again Well located hotel in heart of Amsterdam. Bit of a mix up when checking in which needed sorted out, got a double rather than a twin, otherwise no problems. Staying room only although did try breakfast one morning, its okay but you can find better breakfast outside once you know your way around. Quite busy, everytime we went past recepotion someone was either checking in or checking out. No problems keeping our bags on day of departure after we had checked out. ',GOOD,
'OK This place was okay. After reading many reviews I expected more -- mostly we were disappointed with the room, that although big, was on the lower ground floor, faced an ugly courtyard, and you could see into the windows from reception. I hear rooms with canal views are nicer.I suspiciously wonder if there is a thing as an expedia room -- I find whenever I book what appears to be a relatively nice hotel on a great deal from Expedia, I get a crap room (this happened once before at the 4 star Barbizon Palace in Amsterdam.Still the hotel was well located, between two lovely quiet canals, and walkable to anywhere you'd want to go. However, it smelled a bit of cleaning detergent and lacked character -- won't be staying again. ',POOR,
'a good location stayed at this hotel bank holiday weekend.the location is very good and local to all attractions.if you get room 423 make sure you change as this is in the roof and being tall i had no chance in the shower or entering the room door.we was changed after first night to a great room on the ground floor,the hotel staff were very helpful. have visited amsterdam many times but as i found this year it is like everything VERY EXPENSIVE!! ps the sweets on reception are a winner after visiting coffee shops :-) ',POOR,
'Nice stay but ...       another room ',POOR,
'great hotel for amsterdam away from the masses of louts This is a nice hotel on herengracht which means you are based on the nine streets. If you want a nice clean comfortable hotel away from the masses and louts around dam square this is one for you. The area is much more atmospheric than that area and cleaner and more peaceful with plenty of lovely restaurants and funky bars.It is on the edge of the jordaan which is the nicest part of the city.There are also lots of vintage clothes stores and independent boutigues and shoe shopsThe hotel is clean and has everything you need ( but no internet room/cafe if you want to pre check in on line) it is not glamourous or anything but the rooms are a good size for amsterdam where the hotel rooms as a rule are small. The bathroom was spotless as was the bedlinen and towels etc. We were given the canal view we asked for and we found the staff helpful and friendly. This is a non smoking hotel in line with EU Law so the smoking smell mentioned by another reviewer is not an issue any longer.They will also lend you an umbrella if it is raining which is nice. I would not bother with breakfast in the hotel as there are plenty of cafes nearby check out teh lovely Pancakes! pancake house which is on Berenstraad only a 5-10 minute walk away instead.You can book on their own website and this was a lower price as the prices I found with the usual internet providers so it is worth checking out their own website to see what price they are offeringAll in all I would really recommend this hotel for location and service. ',GOOD,
'Perfect for us In the heart of it in old Amsterdam. We walked everywhere as there was no travelling but it was also very quiet. We got a cheap deal for 99 Euros so we weren't in the best room. Out the back overlooking the coutryard. However the room was clean and basic. Staff were friendly. Nice old building with huge beam a foot thick.Breakfast was expensive and we found it better to eat at the little cafes (the only drawback is lots of places didn't open until 11am).No fridge so we couldn't eat our own basic meals but this wasn't a huge drama. Cheap wireless internet for us to connect to so we could continue running our business. We were very happy with our selection. ',GOOD,
'In general, normal Stops in July with my wife for 8 nights. A good hotel, deserves 3*. But everywhere the smell of cigarettes, is a big minus for non-smokers. However, from 1 - July banned smoking in the hotel. Staff is very friendly! They say in Italian, Spanish, German, English and Russian languages. I had a room with windows on the street at the Singel canal, but there are rooms with windows on Herenkraft. With the windows into the courtyard is better not to take, as well as very noisy. Food is very expensive, both for such a meagre choice. However, down the street Herenkraft, there is a wonderful buffet Buffet van Odette, where breakfast and we are.Mike Rokhmanyuk, Ukraine ',GOOD,
'Central and Spacious I took my young family to visit Amsterdam, a place I used to live pre-children. From past experience, I've known Amsterdam to be quite expensive especially true for hotels. Hotel Rembrandt Centrum is not different, although it does offer better value for money than the rest of the hotels in the same star bracket. The location is better too. Close enough to be part of the action but in a quiet enough locale to skip the noise and traffic. I booked a quadruple room and it was more than spacious enough to fit two adults and three young children. The bonus was the lovely view onto Singel. This is typically a three star hotel so don't expect too much in the way of room decor or standard. The staff were extremely friendly and an asset to the hotel. ',GOOD,
'decent Location I visited Amsterdam last week with my boyfriend, and we wanted some where safe and centerally located to stay and at a reasonable price! 鈧?78 for 2 nights is a great deal for a 3 star hotel, considering the price of some dodgy hostels! The hotel is about 15 min walk from central station take a taxi for 鈧?0! Dam Square, Madame Tusads, Red light district are all only less than a 5 min walk away. The hotel is safe  clean, rooms are decent sized with all mod cons, if you are just looking for some where clean, central and rather cheap this is the place! Staff are helpful and friendly! No air con in rooms is a disadvantage, we had to keep window wide open 24hrs, as room was so warm! Weird smell in some corridors! But i would recommend this place  would stay ere again! ',POOR,
'Lovely Hotel Three of us stayed at this hotel for two nights we arrived at 1pm and were checked in quickly and efficiently. Our room was on the first floor with three large windows overlooking the canal. It was a lovely large light room with two single beds and a double sofa bed. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We rang reception for tea and coffee and a tray was brought to our room within minutes. The breakfast was amazing, cereal, fresh fruit, yoghurt, toast, fresh coffee and all the usual cooked english breakfast items. It was as good as any 4star hotel.The staff were all polite and smiling and the public rooms were spick and span.You must visit a pancake house and hire a bike, quite an experience. ',GOOD,
'Perfect stay The hotel was pretty easy to find and a quick walk from the tram stop a couple of streets away. When we arrived the staff were very helpful, and spoke excellent English. We had booked a room for 3 with a canal view but were told that unfortunately they only had a ground floor triple room without the view. This turned out to be fine, we had a view of the courtyard (someone else described this as prison-like) but that depends on your point of view - the room was light enough and we didn't spend time looking out the window. The room was lovely, a good size for a triple with 3 single beds, average sized bathroom (with bath not just a shower), desk, table and chairs, hairdryer, etc. Our weekend stay was great and the hotel is in the perfect location for exploring all aspects of Amsterdam, you are literally within walking distance of everything, there are some nice little shops nearby, good selection of restaurants a couple of canals away and 5 mins from Dam square. ',GOOD,
'Lovely Place to stay We booked to stay here from Easter sunday for two nights through last minute.com as a top secret deal so we did'nt know which hotel we had booked till we had paid. We were two streets from Dam Square ideal location for Leidesplain or Red light district great for everything really we were very happy. True we did'nt have a great view out the window but the rooms were more than adequately spaced for two in a twin room, we paid a very low price and that is very hard to do in amsterdam for the location , at the end of very busy days exploring and eating out with all the shopping we has a convienent quite clean room. This was my fourth trip to amsterdam and my best hotel choice so far. ',GOOD,
'It was different       the bedroom ',POOR,
'A good choice We've just come back from a 2 night stay in the Rembrandt Centrum and it was a very pleasant stay we booked a triple room with two double beds and was given room 326 which faced the canal and was a very good size with a sofa bed as well as the two doubles, our radiator wasnt working and we were offered an alternative room or an electric heater, after seeing the alternative room we decided on the heater, as the room was in the attic of the hotel with very little head height and not acceptable if you happen to be taller than 5'8 (room 422), staff were friendly and helpful and as mentioned in other reviews the location is very good only minutes from the hussle and bussle but such a nice quiet street. We booked a non smoking room but it is obvious that guests flount the rules as there was a smell of smoke in our room and some burns to the carpet. The website we booked through advertised tea and coffee making facilities, they are available but at a cost of 5 euros a day.I would have no hesitation of recommending this hotel and would stay here again. ',GOOD,
'just the job! I stayed at the Rembrandt Centrum for 4 nights and it suited my needs perfectly. The room was absolutely spotless and everything was in working order. The staff were very efficient, helpful and polite. The hotel is in the perfect location for sightseeing (about 3 mins walk from Dam square) and over looks the Herengracht (when you open the curtains in the morning it is a most beautiful sight!)If you want 5* luxury then this hotel is not for you (but then you wouldn't be looking at this review would you?) if what you want is a well-run good, clean, honest hotel in stunning surroundings then press the book now button, trust me you'll not do better than this! ',GOOD,
'Great Location I stayed with my daughter at this hotel for a short city break in Feb 08. It is a great location about a 3 minute walk from Dam Square. We felt very safe even walking back at night, The hotel was clean and friendly and our room was fine not at all small as others have said. The breakfast was excellent and you could even have cooked if you wanted. There was a big selection of breads,cheese, cereals, juice, and fresh fruit and yoghurts. We would definately recommend it and would stay again.Eat at the argentinian restaurant as you walk to Dam Square best steak I've ever had and really friendly service. ',GOOD,
'Great basic hotel in nice location I think this is a good 3* hotel. The welcome was extremely efficient and almost friendly (maybe it bordered on being almost robotic) but nothing to complain about really.The room was basic but very clean. The bathroom had a good shower over the bath. The bed was only a double and a little soft but the pillows were fine. We had a canal view room which was nice when you looked out but was a little noisy one night from drunks outside. There are rooms on an inner courtyard which, with hindsight, I would choose in preference.The buffet breakfast had good choices and I was surprised at the amount of choice.My biggest gripe was the lack of a hairdryer. Apparently the hotel owns 7 but they were all lent out to other guests. I was not amused on a morning with sub zero temperatures outside. To be fair, they found one for me after breakfast and were very apologetic.The hotel is in a nice area of the city and only 5 minutes walk from Dam Square and about 10 minutes from the Central station.Over all I was very satisfied with my stay. ',GOOD,
'A Great Value and Almost Five Stars This was a great find. I researched and researched to find the best deal. I succeeded with the help of this hotel and a European internet booking company. You have to plan when you are going, since I do understand that the rates are typically much higher. I certainly cannot complain about the hotel's holiday rate.The location is superb. It is a block from one of my favorite hotels in Amsterdam and a fraction of the price. There are nice loft-like hotels that can look out onto the canal. Based on the view that our room had, we just wanted to stay and relax in our hotel after a long flight.I will say that there are definitely ways to save in getting to the hotel. First, you can take the train from Schiphol to Central Station. From there, you can take the 1,2, or 5 tram, and you will be about 3 blocks from the hotel. I was very impressed with the local transportation. Be aware that for early morning flights, you may have to walk to the Central Station. The tram does not go out before 6 am. If you do go out, go in groups of 2 or more. It is not the safest to be out in the early morning hours. The police patrol the area, but that may not always be enough. Also, it is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel to the train station.Seeing as there was so much savings and excellent accomodations, why would it not be five stars? There were two things that caused my husband and I to give it 4 stars. There are no alarm clocks and hair dryers in the rooms. Honestly, that seems fairly minimal until you take into effect - jet lag and a morning flight to our final destination. Other suggestions for improvements might be: air conditioning during the summer, affordable breakfast, more info about internet capabilities (TMobile Hot Spot) and wake up calls, and finally, better ways to keep out the colder draft. All in all, I am very impressed. The service is very good. Hopefully, next time I can give it the powerful 5 stars. Until then, I would highly recommend it. It is not luxury, but it is definitely worthwhile.Have fun in Amsterdam! The canal, inexpensive eateries, wonderful archetecture, and museums make it a place to remember. You'll be happy to visit Rembrandt Centrum. ',GOOD,
'Great Little Hotel The Rembrandt is a great little hotel situated only 5 mins away from Dam Sq. The rooms on the front have a nice canal view and overall the hotel is in very good condition. We stayed for 5 nights with a canal view room. The hotel was within walking distance of all the major attractions, with Anne Frank鈥檚 house only a couple of minutes walk away. The room was spacious and modern and was also very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anybody that wants to explore Amsterdam by foot. ',GOOD,
'If you don't like cigarette smoke, stay away! Location is great. Room and bathroom extremely clean. Breakfast was so-so. Reasonably priced. Friendly and helpful employees. Our big complaint was the smoking. There is a sitting room next to the front entrance, and the front desk is located here as well. People (including the chain-smoking desk clerks) regularly smoked in this room. All smoke wafted straight up the stairs to the guest rooms. Our room constantly smelled (day and night). It really drove us crazy. If you are a smoker, this is a great hotel. If you don't like smoke, stay away! ',POOR,
'Great loation but overpriced for quality Overall, our experience at this hotel was positive. The reception staff was friendly and helpful -- they let us store our bags a few hours before checkin because the room wasn't ready.We reserved a triple room which was very large. The room was very clean although barely decorated and on the dated side. The best feature of the hotel was the location right off of Dam Square. Everything was in walking distance which was perfect. My biggest disappointment for the stay was getting a room without a view as this was one of the main reasons I picked this hotel over others.The bathroom was a bit problematic as the ceiling in the shower was very low and quite moldy. My husband and brother had a hard time washing their hair without bumping the moldy ceiling - yuck! also, the bathroom was extremely small so anything on the sink vanity was completely soaked because the shower curtain didn't really do the trick (the vanity light less than 6 inches from the shower also made me a bit nervous as it got pretty wet.) Our showerhead was also broken and was held up by a paperclip.Overall, the location of the hotel was good but I think I could have found a much better value elsewhere -- either better quality for the money or the same quality for less money. I do not think I'll return to this hotel. ',POOR,
'excellent location We went to Amsterdam for my brother-in-laws 40th birthday so there 20 of us staying in the hotel. The rooms were of different shapes and sizes. Our triple room was pretty big. It was clean and comfortable. The location was good. Not right in the centre but it was close enough to walk to the attractions,restaurants, and bars. Mind you after having a few drinks all the canals look the same to me. We did get lost several times! ',GOOD,
'Good central location, Very clean, Quiet area.       Rembrandt Centrum Hotel ',POOR,
'Good location Having booked with Last Minute.com we were a little apprehensive as to what to expect. We flew with KLM - really impressed with the overall service - on the ground and in the air.The hotel is basic but very clean and overlooks a canal. Decided not to go for the breakfast in the hotel but had room service a few times and that was fine. We used the train from the airport to the hotel - both times - the train was on the platform and straight through - it takes approx. 20 minutes - train fare 16 euros return for two people - a bargain! From the station, we took a taxi - a little expensive for such a short journey - 1.9kms - charged 12 euros going to hotel and 10 euros back to the station.The location of the hotel was good if you don't mind walking - only minutes away from the main Dam square, Anne Franks House, Museums and Boat Trips. Eating out is about the same price as in the UK - don't expect a cheap meal out and you won't be disappointed afterall it is a city. The only thing I would say is that if you like a cup of tea or coffee, there are no facilities in the room. You can buy them at the bar or order in your room up until 10.30pm. Overall, a good city break for a couple of days. ',POOR,
'Great location, lovely clean hotel - recommended to everyone! Just returned from 2 nights in the Rembrandt Centrum and absolutely loved it! Took a chance on lastminute.com by booking a Top Secret Hotel and ended up in this 3 star delight, right on the Herrengracht Canal and about a 10 minute stroll away from Dam Square! Fab!Hotel is a typical 3 star really - very clean, very helpful staff and porters, nice breakfast buffet and you can book excursions at reception too.Rooms are basic, very clean with good showers and comfy beds...Location is perfect! Away from any noisy roads set right on the front of the canal and close to all the major attractions!Would recommend to all!! ',GOOD,
'Reeky, small, noisy, stiflingly hot... urgh. We arrived here on 23rd of August, reading reviews we hoped to find a compact small room close to the centre of town.What we got was excellent in terms of location but failed misrably on all other civilized means of measure.We booked a double room and were given a twin, I thought since we had arrived at around 2pm this could be remedied however the ineptitude of the hotel's spaced out staff began to prevail, we heard in some stoned out tones that it was our fault for booking it wrong (we later checked, no it was the hotel in error, shock) and we would have to wait until the next day... okay, not so bad.Since it was toasty out, and no air-con in the rooms (yep, a misnomer in the hotel details advertise(d)) we opened the window to what seemed like the construction of a world class sporting arena, this swapped over into screaming and sustained argument between dodgier aspects of the community at around 10.30pm till late.We thought the next day would be better, shock horror it got worse. The only double room available was next to reception, meaning not only did we have the construction crews and skanky aspects to listen to we were also now on the recieivng end of drunken weekenders remote vitriol to one another. The double bed is pushed aside a wall meaning some late night fumbling (heh heh) - only thing is the only fumble is a kick when the lavvy's needed! The third day we fumbled our way out of the place, I took a lot of convincing not to leave some good acts of sabotage in the room by my better half, and we checked into the Grand Hotel (Grand Sofitel). Not cheap by any means but sooooo comfortable, since the room they were going to give us was occupied so a free upgrade to a suite and some free booze certainly cheered us up.The only thing going for the Rembrandt is the TV channel choice is good (helps drown out the screaming - I wondered at one point if it was the other inmates) but the screen makes matchboxes look huge.And it reeked. ',POOR,
'Very small room This hotel was a dissapointment. Our double room was on the 1st floor just down the corridor from the front desk. The room was very small and also had a tiny bathroom. We believe that it was a converted single room or perhaps even staff accomodation!. Front desk was not very helpful either. They seemed unhappy - no smiles, decidedly cold. Strange as the rest of the city offered great friendly service wether it was in retail stores, markets or pubs and cafes. I did overhear other guests talking about spacious rooms on upper levels - may be we were just unlucky with our room. I suggest you ask for an alternative if offered a room on the first floor. breakfast in the basement is OK - nothing special.A tip for a lovely lunch on the go. Make sure you visit two traditional food outlets on Zeedijk. Ambachtelijke Slageri Vet - number 99, a great little deli with the most excellent cold cuts and hot meat sandwiches. The other is for lovers of seafood - Vischhandel 1938 - number 129. Visit here for delicious fried battered mussels and shrimp and several varieties of smoked fish which they make into sandwiches and rolls for you. No fries though. ',POOR,
'Comfortable Picked this up as a lastminute.com mystery room. Having checked out where this was on the web we were quite sure about what we were getting.Comfortable, well-specified but no breakfast. Certainly no problems or issues. Unfortunately this is retrospective review as we visited six months ago but we were quite happy with our stay and very pleased with the level of cleanliness and noise which are our main criteria.

'Decent Hotel Spent 2 nights at the hotel 20th July 2007 in a double room with breakfast.The room was 111 and was adequate for our needs, although the room could be considered small as the double bed was against the wall at one side and the bathroom was a bit tight - but how long do you spend in your room?However the room and bathroom were very clean and towels changed each day. Good TV , but no tea and coffee making facilities but not a real problem as there are plenty of bars and coffee shops nearby.Breakfast was very good with a large selection of hot and cold foods, in a lovely sunny room overlooking the canal, with excellent service from the staff.The hotel reception staff were also very good and very helpful booking trips, and providing directions.The hotel is in a very good location, near to Dam Square, Anne Franks House, Canal Boat Trips, Red Light District and the main shops.There may be cheaper hotels but this hotel has LOCATION LOCATION. ',GOOD,
'OK hotel but not perfect The hotel was a nice basic quality hotel. the location was lovely once you found it (not right in the middle of everything, but a short walk away). When i booked i had booked a twin room but added a note to the booking to ask if i could have a double, this was noted and we were given a double room. The bathroom was a nice size and the room was non smoking, also as i had requested. We hadn;t booked breakfast with our room so i can;t comment on the food. however the bar was excellent, even though it didn;t open very late. We stayed in room 111 and the only downside was that there's a hot pipe that runs through the room which always seemed to be on. although the entral heating was switched off. it felt like it was on full 24/7 and this was hard work, expecially when the july nights were warm. on the first morning i got a shower which was gorgeous and powerful, but the shower fell off the wall. however, as soon as i notified reception this was fixed. all in all a good hotel and i would definitely stay again, providing it wasnt in room 111!!

'service with a smile no problems here. staff very helpfull and would offer and advice you needed..rooms very clean and tidy tea and coffee anytime in bar was agodsend. drinks costing good and hotel was close to some very good shopping areas and to walk the canals from the hotel was a pleasure thumbs up to all the staff there would loved to have spent more time there but had to move on.

'A real diamond if you get a canal view I've stayed in amsterdam many times and this hotel is not too bad at all. The rooms are quite good by dutch standards and if you are wanting a twin please ask for room 9 overlooking the canal. Breakfast a little pricey but quite nice for european standards, no full english though. Overall very good location, hotel and a great little place to stay. ',GOOD,
'Disgraceful Whlst this souds awfully shallow and elitist, I am used to 5-star hotels only. The reason for my staying in this place was that it was booked by others for a stag weekend, hence, I HAD to stay there to stick with the party. I would suggest that no-one stays here ever, as it is dreadful in the extreme. Dire does not justify the extremely poor standards of the hotel - rooms are grotty and have a musty stench. I have a car with more interior space than the bathroom (the car is 2-seater - that's how small the bathroom is) and the staff were as helpful as a chocolate fireguard. Taxi drivers do not seem to know the name or location of the hotel - some ambiguity there. The hotel wasnt even particularly cheap either.The only reasonably positive aspect of the hotel is its location. ',POOR,
'Thin Walls great location the location was great, it was quite and very autnentic but still near to the dam squre.the personal was very freindly and efficient. I did not like the noise from the other rooms (and not the one you are thinking of :))it seems the walls are very thin so every door closer was heard. ',POOR,
'1st Trip to Amsterdam I booked a trip to Amsterdam in January 2007 for myself and 5 friends for 3 nights. I spent many hours looking around the web for a good hotel, finally decided on the Rembrandt Residence for a number of reasons, Location is very good, typical picturesque cannel side location, quite side road, but very near all the sights, dam square 2 min walk away. A few near death experiences with cyclists outside the hotel, but you have to get used to the idea that cyclists rule the roads in Amsterdam!Price was good for Amsterdam but shop around as prices differ hugely for this hotel. I would say this hotel had an excellent location and is one of the hotels biggest assets.We were offered 3 twin rooms all on the ground floor, one next to reception which was a bit noisy in the mornings but nothing too bad. Over eager cleaning staff with Hoovers at 7.30am ! Rooms were very clean and of an average size, no in-room safe was a let down but otherwise each room was equipped with most things needed. (no tea or coffee in room, but only 1.5 euro in the bar). Our Shower curtain leaked like a sieve so we had daily moping up to do on the bathroom floor. Lots of hot water when needed.Smoking is allowed in the reception/bar area and although it did not bother me, some guests found this off putting as it got quite smokey at times and was the first thing to hit you when entering the hotel.Breakfast was a mix of American and traditional Amsterdam fair, as much as you can eat, coffee/tea was always too cold for my taste. Toaster blew up on our 1st day and never came back.. Breakfast room gets quite busy late in the mornings (9.30-10.00am) so get in early.Staff were all very friendly and helpful, although they could not direct me to an internet cafe (Amsterdam has very few Internet cafe's, business opportunity maybe ?) In summary, a very good hotel considering there are so many bad hotels in Amsterdam in this price range. Would defiantly book again in the future and this hotel has a lot to offer for the money. ',GOOD,
'Good Three Star Hotel I stayed at the Rembrandt Centrum from June 3-6, 2007. My room was big by Amsterdam standards and clean. For 鈧?9/night, inclusive of taxes, this hotel was a good value. My only complaint is the hotel does not offer in-room safes or mini-bars.The location is good and the area near the hotel is quiet. At 鈧?9 per night, I would stay here again. ',POOR,
'Top place to stay Booked as unnamed hotel through Last Minute so a bit nervous but an excellent choice. Quiet hotel yet very close to Dam Square and all the activity. Very near Anne Franks house. Had lovely clean airy room overlooking courtyard. Staff very helpful and toiletries replenished daily. Only disappointment was that there was no hairdryer in room. Breakfast not fantastic so did not bother after first night as we had not pre paid for it and there were plenty of places to eat nearby. Would recommend Spuistrasse for restaurants. Excellent Irish bar round corner of hotel selling a reasonably priced pint. Would definitely stay here again. Two words of warning - beware of the taxis outside central station. We were charged 20 euros for the short journey to the hotel. On the way home the hotel arranged a taxi and it only cost us 5 euros. Secondly there will be a daily room tax of 3.65 euros to pay as you leave. As we had pre paid for our room we were not prepared to be given this bill as we left. This is standard in all hotels and should be pointed out to you at booking. ',GOOD,
'Very bad service The hotel was chosen primary for the location, and the location was indeed central. But that's about it. The single room is tiny, windows to the courtyard, practically no sound insulation, so all the sounds of cleaning ladies are loud and clear.The hotel insists on sharp 12 pm check out, but the check out process is terrible, to say the least - the computers freeze, there is obviously a huge bottleneck at the reception and a substantial waiting time. We were waiting for the luggage to be brought from storage for ages - only to realize that the staff in fact speaks neither Dutch, English or German to understand the intstructions of the reception to bring the rest of the bags.Even having paid in advance through the agency, the hotel promptly double charged us on the check-out with subsequent waste of our time to sort it out with the credit card company, the travel agency and the hotel. The hotel was not helpful at all.We would not stay there again. ',POOR,
'Still Waiting for a Refund (Please note...I have never stayed here but I had to enter a date to be able to post this warning)I made a reservation here; cancelled it 2 days later (months before my trip to Amsterdam). Upon returning home, I discovered they have charged my credit card for the room I did not occupy. They have not responded to my email or my snail mail and I am dealing with the CC company for a complete refund. The booking agency has a record that the reservation was cancelled (and I have my personal copy) and a record that they notified the hotel. Hotel email address seems to be 'closed down.'Also, there is a descrepancy about the name of the hotel. I was charged for a room at the Rembrandt RESIDENCE (where I have never made a reservation) and my reservation and cancellation is for the Rembrandt CENTRUM. The hotel's online presence is dual; each has the same street address, phone and fax number. The CCcharge was to the R Residence; the reservation/cancellation for the R Centrum and the email addy the booking agency gave me to contact them was for the R Residence. Go figure! ',POOR,
'Not recommended - there are better for less 拢 It's extremely overpriced for what you get even taking the great location into account. My boyfriend and I were put into a dingy cupboard with the tiny bathroom ceiling in the process of collapsing and no shower rail. We had arrived late, exhausted and couldn't face the hassle of changing, but asked for a change the next day. The staff were not exactly apologetic, but the new room, while basic, was a decent size and had a fabulous view down the canal. I have stayed in various hotels in Amsterdam and this one was the most disappointing. Try the one next door as a tourist office recommended it and it looks great [--] (Hotel Estherea), or see about a deal with the Radisson as we thought that was really good - room 326 has a fab beamed ceiling.

'Highly recommended We have just returned from a few days in Amsterdam. We stayed at The Rembrandt Residence Hotel and we were delighted with our choice. It was in a perfect location and near to lots of places you would want to visit during a stay in this city. The room, although small, faced the canal and was very quietly located and was cleaned thoroughly with new pillow cases and towels daily.The staff were very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was very good and there was a choice of both hot and cold food. Our only tiny niggle we could possibly come up with is that tea/coffee facilities in the room would have been the icing on the cake. Otherwise perfect...................A brilliant place to stay and we highly recommend it. ',GOOD,
'great location comfy hotel Stayed here for three nights in June. Great location just a short walk from anywhere really. The staff at the desk were very friendly and provided us with a map and tips for all the local sights. our first room didn't have a shower only a bath as it was on the top floor with low ceilings. We asked to be moved and were dealt with efficiently but had to sacrifice the view for a room with a shower. The room was basic and very dated furniture but clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was nice. There was no real bar in the hotel. If you're looking for a good location and no real luxury then this is the place for you. ',POOR,
'Top secret on last minute!!!!!! Booked this hotel as one of lastminute.coms Top secret hotel package. Dont fall for this one its just a con! There is no benefit in booking this way and last minute dont give a stuff once you have booked their customer service is TERRIBLE!The hotel itself was average the staff were very nice and helpful, although their idea of a room with a view is looking into a dingy courtyard.The pay television didnt work and contacting reception required some figuring out as the telephone had the wrong number listed.The room was on the top floor and still had Anne Franks furniture in it.Tiny bath with only a shower attachment in a room with a coombed ceiling made having a shower a challenge.No Hair dryer and no power anywhere near a mirror.Too expensive for whats on offer.N.B if you have a point to raise with Lastminute there is a website with their contact details as they dont give you them.Just google it. ',POOR,
'Great location, comfy bed Took us a while to find the hotel as Herengracht is rather long and it was a dark rainy night. Tip, for others who can get themselves lost inside a small paper bag, it's located at the Dam sq part of the centre - take one of the horizontals from here past Singel and you should be fine.We booked through last minute and the location was the real reason for the choosing the place. Whilst we didn't have a canal view, we did have a window out into a court yard. Since our room was at ground floor level this made us feel quite secure.The bedroom was a good size, incorporating a kingsize bed, desk, wardrobe and a couple of chairs with ensuite bath/shower room. Slept really well, didn't get any noise from inside the hotel, and even the canal seemed pretty quiet to be honest. the bed was just soooo comfy that I would stay there again anytime!It was nice and warm which gave us the chance to dry out our wet clothes and shoes.The reception staff were always friendly and attentive and happy to stow your luggage until your flight home.Didn't have breakfast at the hotel (extra 12.5 euros) but can say it did smell good! We went out to eat ours at one of the many local cafes in the area. ',GOOD,
'Great Place Friendly Staff Had a great four days at the hotel in early January. First night was stuck in a small but adequate room. I went to the desk and asked if I could get a canal view room. The front desk lady said to check in the morning. Morning came and I went down to the front desk where the lady the night before had left a message with the desk people who knew exactly what I wanted and told me to pack my stuff and a canal view room would be ready for me in the afternoon. Returned form a day of sightseeing and was moved into a large beautiful double room on Singal canal. I was very happy, needless to say, with the efficiency of the front desk and the beauty of my view. Throughout my stay the hotel and the staff continued to impress me. ',GOOD,
'Great Location A pretty standard hotel with the usual small rooms associated with Amsterdam hotels.However the hotel is very clean and well located and a good option for this price bracket. ',GOOD,
'Great Location           ',GOOD,
'Great Great Great Hotel We stayed here after christmas for a few days to relax and enjoy Amsterdam. It was a easy walk from Centraal Station and right on the canal which was easy on the eyes even though it was December. The staff was extremely helpful and gave us a map where everything was. The room was nice and very comfortable. Ideal location nothing is more than a 10-15 minute walk and they are very accomadating. ',GOOD,
'Very noisy This hotel was a little noisy with the passing people on the canal but not to the point of keeping us awake because people maybe loud but they move past fairly quickly.The problem was the hotel and it's uncaring staff , with delivery/ collection times at 6.30am -7.15am directly under our window.I know deliveries have to take place, but when they are laughing shouting and having no concern for their residents I find this appalling. We asked for a canal facing room and I had read a few reviews that mentioned passing noise, we can live with that. But this was just total disregard for their paying guests.If you are considering this hotel either ask for a room on the fourth floor or away from the loading bay. Have no other complaints, it was clean ,breakfast ok, apart from having to queue like cattle going to milking to get a seat in the breakfast room (that was because we were late, because so tired from delivery disturbances). If you have booked this hotel contact them by telephone and request room away from loading bay.Ruth Clough Manchester ',POOR,
'Perfect location Returned today from Amsterdam. The hotel is perfect for central Amsterdam just 5 minutes from Dam Square. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The room we had was enormous and very clean. We were in a group of 8 (4 rooms) and each one was very clean and spacious. If you haven't been to Amsterdam before, its worth ringing the hotel before travelling and asking them to organise a taxi from the airport. We wasted a good half hour trying to find one when we landed. The only downer is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, so we would say take a travel kettle and a couple of cups with you if you like a cuppa! We would certainly go back to this hotel and recomend it for location cleanliness and the friendly staff. ',GOOD,
'Rembrandt Residence - Enjoyed staying at this hotel Just returned 24 September and really liked Rembrandt Residence. We were given a huge triple room overlooking Singel canal even though we had only booked double. Staff on reception were lovely with a smile and a hello whenever we went in and out, unlike some hotels where they pointly ignore you. We bought our museum tickets from reception and the girls chatted and gave us advice on dining areas etc. Breakfast was much the same as any continental hotel we have stayed at and there was more than enough of it, cereal. eggs, cold meats etc. The location was fantastic 10/15 mins walk from Centraal Station and 15/20 mins from the Museum quarter with its fantastic range of restaurants. We were on second floor and we could hear people outside late at night /early morning but that is Amsterdam not the hotel and it did not keep us from sleeping. We were lucky with the room but even without that this is a good 3* hotel in a super location and we would definately stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Never again!!!! I stayed in this Hotel with my partner for 4 nights and it was awful.We booked a canal-view.What a joke.The room was a broom cupboard.The double bed was pushed against the wall otherwise we couldn't get into the room.I lost the flip the cointo see who sleeps against the wall and had to climb into my side of the bed via the bottom.the windows only opened app 5 cm as the curtain rail was in the way.The bathroom was very smelly,the whole room had a dirty yellow colour and extremely drab.I wouldn't have minded,if we'd booked a cheap hotel,but 397 GBP for 4 nights is not cheap.The reception staff did offer us another room and we moved.It was much bigger,but no canal view ,infact we had a view into other peoples rooms and the reception from which the noise of loud talking,laughing staff was hugely annoying from 7 am til 12 midnight.The excuse we got from the staff to the reason why we couldn't have a room in the new tract with canal view was that we wanted a non-smoking room.I was completely gobsmacked ,that we couldn't have a nice room just because we were non smokers. ',POOR,
'Great Service! We really liked this hotel! The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was well located, about a 10 minute walk from Centraal Station. Good for families or backpackers... The breakfast was very tasty! The hotel desk sells tickets to many local attractions, I recommend taking advantage of this feature as you will bypass lines at the museums, etc.One bad thing was that we had a canal view room (nice) but it was pretty loud at night. It's Amsterdam, people are up late. If you want quiet in the Summer months opt for a different view. (In the Summer the windows will be open for fresh air- no AC - very typical European accomodations.)I have stayed in some dumps in Amsterdam, this place is very nice! ',GOOD,
'great location my husband and i stayed for 3 nights at the begining of june and we were very impressed with the location within comfortable walking distance of dam square. the hotel itself was very clean although the room was a little compact but adequate for our needs. the hotel staff were very helpful all in all would definately stay there again and amsterdam was a lovely place that i would reccomend anyone to viist. ',GOOD,
'not the best in amsterdam Fairly good location - reasonable distance from the many tourist attractions in Amsterdam and in a reasonably quiet location - not too much noise from outside. Very small room although it was very clean. Breakfast was extremely average - bread rolls, cheese, cold meat, scrambled eggs, etc. Quite expensive for what is offered. Staff helpful  friendly. We arranged to fly to Amsterdam on Queen's Day (something to do with Royalty, not to be confused with the excellent Gay Pride celebrations!) so the Rembrandt Residence was all we could get as so many hotel rooms were already booked. We have stayed in other hotels in Amsterdam that offer far better value for money and are in nicer locations. We won't hurry back to Rembrandt. ',POOR,
'Good Location. Small Room I was here on business, so was not too bothered about the room. But the room I was given was small  basic, but clean. Could do with modernising. However, the location of this hotel is great, the staff were helpful  it was nice to walk up a quiet street after work.Don't just sit in your room, get out  meet the Dutch! ',POOR,
'Not Bad Great Location, within 5-10 mins of Dam Square, good shopping and the red light district.Staff on reception were friendly and allowed us to swap our two single beds for the double room we had requested.The room however was very small, barely enough room for our two suitcases. We may have been able to overlook this if we had a better view, but sadly the courtyard in all it's concrete glory, was all we could see....Breakfast was nice and simple, breads, cereal, juice, fruit and two choices of egg.Whilst we had a pleasant stay we won't be rushing back for the $300AUS per night we shelled out for this hotel... ',POOR,
'Nice hotel, good location We stayed at the Rembrandt Residence Hotel in April 2006. We found the hotelto be in a good location and our room was quite large. Bathrooom was also verybig. We had a view of the canal which was wonderful although we could not figure out how to lock the windows. We were on the 2nd floor so it was nota problem. The staff was very pleasant and we enjoyed our stay. We wouldstay here again. We thought the breakfast was a little less than we expected. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel We stayed here for four nights and found the hotel to be very good value with an excellent location. Although we booked through Expedia, I did email the hotel directly to request a canal view room. We were given a large, very clean, quiet three-bedded room (number 320) which had a lovely view over the Singel canal. Sure, the room is basic, the towels could do with a higher thread count, but for the money and the location, we would definitely return. We found the staff to be helpful enough. ',GOOD,
'Bad experience We booked our room at this hotel way in advance. On arrival, we were given the smallest, pokiest room I have ever seen. The room was situated right at the back of the hotel. I went to the front desk to complain and was treated in a very high handed, very unprofessional way. To their credit, the next day they moved us to a bigger room, with a canal view. But the initial treatment by the manager (she insisted that she was in charge) - after a long flight, marred my opinion of Amsterdam. The rest of the stay was o.k. but I will never recommend this hotel nor go back for a repeat visit. ',POOR,
'Good Location Stayed in a triple room for last weekend in March. The hotel is in a great location just from Dam Square. The rooms were large, clean and came with a nice view. The reception staff were very helpful, and assisted with any questions we had. The breakfast was not a great standard, however the location and quality of the rooms would make me stay again. ',GOOD,
'Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break 10-12th March 2006. It is an excellent location- we could not have had a better! Right in the heart of the city but on a quiet street overlooking one of the canals.Walking distance to Dam Square, Ann Frank's house and canal boat trips. The rooms are small but clean and comfortable and the staff are very helpful and friendly.Breakfast is continental but certainly adequate.It is also walking distance from Central Station, so beware the taxis who will charge a fortune and take you around half the city to get there. Equip yourself with a map before you go and take a suitcase on wheels.I would definitely stay at this hotel again ',GOOD,
'Loved the Rembrandt We stayed in the Rembrandt Residence Hotel in Amsterdam for 4 nights, and we loved the hotel. The room was very clean and tidy and was cleaned every day. The bathroom was a little small, but very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The small lounge area in the foyer was comfortable and pleasant to have a drink in. The hotel bar hours were peculier to day the least, it opens at 5.00pm and last drinks are at 10.40pm, but once you get to know the times it works very well. The breakfast was excellent, plenty of food and really nice, cheese, meats, eggs, etc. Great coffee!! I have no problem recommending the Rembrandt to anyone. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel I have just returned from a girlie weekend away to Amsterdam. We stayed at the Hotel Rembrandt Residence. The hotel is in a great location. Really easy to get around and near all the tourist locations you would want to visit. Only 15 minutes walk from the central train station and situated on a lovely,quite canal.We got bed and breakfast, which included all the usual things; cereals, eggs, cheese, meat, fruit, yohgurt, breads, tea, coffee, juices etc. It set you up for a busy day walking. Staff are very friendly and helpful. My one and only complaint was that there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room. I reaaly miss my bed time coffee so this did bother me a bit. A hairdryer would also have been useful. I thought these 2 items would have been in a 3 star hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anybody and would use it again if I went back to Amsterdam ',GOOD,
'excellent location and value My wife and three kids recently stayed at this hotel and loved it. The rooms were clean, the building is very historic, and we had a fifth floor room overlooking the Singhel Canal. The breakfast was plentiful. Most importantly, the location was fantastic-just a dew minutes walk from the Dam Square and anne Frank house. It is located right on the Herengracht-one of the nicest canals in the city. I denifinitely recommend this place. ',GOOD,
'Rembrandt Residence Stayed at the Rembrandt Residence Hotel for 3 nights (Feb9-12) on a guys weekend. The room was clean although not modern(typically European). There was no water upon our arrival until after 5:00pm. Once the water was turned on there was no hot water until several hours later. The front desk claimed this was normal for Amsterdam. The shower was less than ideal. Breakfast was decent, especially considering it was free.The area was very nice(although very low key) and the staff was friendly. This was my second time in Amsterdam and considering the cold weather I would have preferred a location a little closer to Central Station. The location was far from bad, however.Contrary to many other reviews, I found Amsterdam very affordable. I may just be used to major US cities as a comparison. Food, drink and various other libations were readily available at very reasonable prices. I would certainly recommend this hotel for couples or families but would likely stay closer to Central Station for another guys weekend. ',GOOD,
'Excellent We asked for a double room but were given a family room as it had a canal view and the room was huge!Very clean rooms and bathrooms.Staff very friendly and helpful.Located in the Jordaan region near Anne Frank House. In a perfect location as it is not too close to the red light district and central station for it to be tacky but it is not too far from them. Is near dam square and overlooks a canal.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and book with ---- as it was much cheaper. ',GOOD,
'good, cheap hotel we stayed at the rembrandt for 3 nights, in february. The hotel was very clean with standard facilities. The rooms were very nice and we had a perfect room overlooking the canal. The staff were very accomodating, on arrival to the hotel we were put in a smoking room (a majority of the rooms seemed to be), we requested we be moved into a non smoking room and were able to the following day. Breakfast was continental and there was plenty of it. There is plenty to do during your stay in amsterdam, but it is quite expensive, particulary for beer!! ',GOOD,
'excellent location , great hotel Our trip to Rembrandt Residence can only be described as fantastic. The location was excellent and very well situated overlooking a canal and very close to everything of interest, restaurants,etc. Our room ( # 307 on the third floor) had a large window overlooking the canal, which i highly recommend and should be requested in advance as we did .There was some road work going on in the front of the hotel but little noise and since we were out of the room all day was of no consequence, and I think by now this would have finished. The room was more than adequate, clean and modern, though not huge ,on the average scale of general hotel rooms in amsterdam I feel this was more than acceptable . Breakfast was basic but well organised and plentiful. All the staff we met were very friendly, helpful and spoke great english ! We would definatly return to the Rembrandt Residence and would recommend it highly. Go and Enjoy Amsterdam ',GOOD,
'Great location We stayed at the Rembrandt Residence  would not hesitate to stay here again. The location was perfect. The hotel staff were very polite  welcoming. They did everything they could to make our stay comfortable. Our room was excellent - very clean  had a lovely view of the canal.My parents had stayed here a few years ago  also couldn't fault it.Breakfast was buffet style and there was plenty of it. Rolls, cereal, cheese, eggs, juice etc.My only critisism was the cigarette smoke smell in our bathroom (??) and also in the bar area. But that's something about Amsterdam you won't change! ',GOOD,
'Great Location, Tiny Room and Small Beds I have just returned from the Rembrandt Hotel. Had a four night stay in the city - great trip. You cannot fault the hotels location which is 3 blocks from Dam Square and about the same from Anne Franks House. The breakfast is fine for the price - we certainly didn;t go hungry and all the staff were very friendly and helpful when asked for directions and extra pillows for our room.Now the downsides. Our room was tiny, it would appear to be a single room which we were unlucky enough to be allocated. The bed was certainly not a double, try and single and a half. This meant I spent 3 of our four nights sleeping on the floor!The shower was broken which meant one had to hand hold it while getting washed - not ideal.Finally there was no heating in our room on 2 of our four nights despite the freezing temperatures.Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel because of the room size - I wasn't expecting luxury but not a room as small as it was!!! ',POOR,
'We liked it We just got back from 5 nights here. For the price this was really more than we expected. We booked 3 rooms for our family and there was a range in sizes, but all the rooms were clean and comfortable with ample storage, TV, radio and everyone on staff were very nice and helpful. The location is excellent right on the canal and close to the Jordaan, Anne Frank House, Dam Square and we walked everywhere. Lots of restaurants nearby, too. We asked for a high floor and view and for 2 of the 3 rooms we got what we asked for. Considering they were fully booked, this was great. The other room was the largest, very spacious, so we were not disappointed in that either. All in all, it is not the Pulitzer, but we really did enjoy our stay. We would recommend. ',GOOD,
'Nice well Located Well located. Staff good  helpful. Room clean. Breakfast basic. Ideal for a low cost city break. ',POOR,
'Hit AND Miss I agree with the other recent reviews. We stayed here for three nites last week. Couldn't ask for a better location - or view. We requested a canal view room, which we somehow got - but this side of the building didn't have internet (huh?) so we had to go downstairs to send anything out. Windows in room: awesome view. Pretty quiet locale. Rest of room REALLY needs updating as everyone else says! Carpets are kinda gross - feel damp all the time. Bathroom was tiny (good luck showering if you have a guy w/ you who's 6' tall!). Temp control was very tricky too...Staff was less than accommodating for an 'official three star' hotel...its like they'd never made restaurant reservations before (a three star should have a concierge desk). Room was very big for Europe and they could charge double if they'd just update the linens and furniture! Room was also dark..but who spends a lot of time in the room? Decent breakfast included in price. Walk everywhere from this hotel (and feel safe)! ',POOR,
'Overpriced and overrated Great location, beautiful reception area however the rooms definately need updating, bathrooms are tiny and you can hear every footstep from people walking up the corridors. Would not return to this hotel - overpriced. ',POOR,
'Great Location The location of the Rembrandt Residence can't be faulted. It's only a short stroll from Dam Square, and a 5-10 minute walk from Leidseplein.Both the room and bathroom were fairly large and the decor was reasonably ok. The buffet breakfast had a pretty good selection. There was work going on in the street outside but this didn't cause any nuisance while we were there.On the negative side, the service was a bit nonchalent. And the lack of air-conditioning was a problem - especially as we were on the top floor. As soon as we left the lift the heat struck us like a blast from an oven.Still, I would recommend this hotel for a short stay. ',POOR,
'Good Place If You're not Going to Spend Much Time in Your Room Stayed at this hotel for four nights in August. The hotel has a very good location. One can easily walk to Dam Square, the Anne Frank Huis and Centraal Station. Trams are 3 minutes away. The public areas and rooms are clean. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The rooms are relatively spartan. The room I had was a single. It was 10'x12'. There were no drawers. There was no desk. There was a single arm chair. The bathroom sink had only a small counter. The food available at breakfast consisted of unappealing eggs, dry cereal, juice, coffee and breads. The bottom line is that the hotel does not have much in terms of amenities. If I go back to Amsterdam, I would probably look to stay someplace else. ',POOR,
'Good Place to Stay My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in late August. Unfortunatley our arrival coincided with the last three days of a week long garbage strike and a Tall Ships festival. We took train trips out of town to The Hague, Delft and Haarlem until they had cleaned the town. The hotel is in a good location for sight seeing and taking the tram. The room was clean, but as we had an inner courtyard room we heard conversations through the windows at night. There was no air conditioning, no hair dryer, no iron. There is a rack in the bathroom to hang up wash. There are also lots of places in the room for your belongings. Breakfast was good, but not excellent. The staff was very helpful. O'Reilly's restaurant serves good meals as does The Luxemborg. Most of the other restaurants in the area were very pricey. There is a large grocery store by the tram stop. Anne Frank's house is just a few blocks away. ',GOOD,
'Rembrandt Residence is a great location Myself and two girlfriends stayed three nights at the Rembrandt. We though it was great. Plenty of room for the 3 of us. There were two twin beds and a sofa sleeper which were all comfortable, not complaints. The staff is VERY courteous and VERY helpful.Make sure your room window doesn't open into the interior courtyard/air shaft. Very noisy, could hear the kitchen. But, at the same time we could hear the church bells ringing earlier in the evening.Great location for walking distance to pretty much everything. One recommendation I have is to use the canal tour bus as an actual way to get around. Instead of using public transport such as bus/tram we used the canal tour bus. Great way to see the city from the water!Another tip, to make it easier to find your way around the city...go by canal names. Once you know where you are based on the canals its alot easier to navigate the city. ;-) ',GOOD,
'Can't recommend On the positives: position is good for exploring the city. Rooms are of resonable size. Lots of negatives: very shubby, smell of smoking throughout. Buffet breakfast is not much at all. Lifts do not stop on the same level for many rooms and all the luggage has to be dragged on the extra steps. Usual car access to the hotel was impossible due to the canal repair works, hotel did not care to contact customers in advance to suggest access from the rare, nor there were any signs on arrival. No air conditioning. Staff was just neutral. Overall: it is no more than 2 star hotel. Negative, would not stay again. ',POOR,
'Basically... Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Rembrandt. Had a 2nd floor room at the rear of the hotel. The room was a slightly bigger than the king bed provided (my side was against a wall) and was as basic as it gets. I'd never stayed in a hotel without a safe or hairdryer in the room 'as standard'. You could get these items from the lobby with a deposit though. The room was kept clean and tidy, so no complaint there. There is continuing work being done in front of the hotel on the Herengracht and you have to make your way over wooden temporary boardwalks which isn't the best first impression.Now comes the free breakfast... Yawn, how boring! The choice was always the same and if you fancy sandwich baps for breakfast this place is for you. A trio of cereals, some rasberry yogurt and some bland looking scambled egg. Urggh.Praise goes to the cleaning staff who were the most polite of people.The location was good with most things walking distance.If we return to Amsterdam we will be looking to stay in an alternative hotel. I'm sure we could get better for the same money. A low three stars for me. ',POOR,
'A perfectly good choice Just returned from spending three nights at this hotel.Had a twin room on the first floor with a view to the canal. I paid a few extra euro for this prior to going, but you might be able to a deal on the phone. The room was clean and roomy enough, but the bathroom was a bit on the small side. No air conditioning and the weather was very hot, but had no trouble getting to sleep as most of the days were spent walking and sightseeing.Breakfast was perfectly adequate, with the usual variety of rolls, cold meats, cheese, eggs, cereal, fruit, juice and tea and coffee.There is a full concierge sevice at which you can book trips etc. There is a bit of work going on outside, but when I was there it was a distance away from the hotel. However, there is an amount of sand from the work outside the hotel and the footpath is of a temporary nature. Have to say this did not detract from our enjoyment.The hotel is in a very quiet area with a few cafes nearby if you fancy a late drink. It is only a five minute walk from Dam Square, and not that far from the Flower Market and Anne Frank house.I would recommend the Rembrandt Residence to anyone looking for a reasonably priced (for Amsterdam) hotel.Finally, there is an excellent restaurant about five minutes to the left down the Herengracht. It is called 'De Admiraal' where you can enjoy a good meal away from the crowds. ',GOOD,
'Excellent hotel We have just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam, having stayed two nights at the Rembrandt Residence. In our opinion (two adults and two children) it is an excellent hotel for the rating. The reception staff were extremely helpful, giving lots of information to first time visitors. The rooms were very clean (we booked two twins) and the bar area is very pleasant. The buffet breakfast was also excellent. It is very central, not far from Dam Square (We travelled by train from the airport and then two stops on the tram). Our rooms were very quiet (4th floor). I would highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Lovely Rembrandt My friend and I stayed 6 nights at the Rembrandt in March of 2005.We had a large, clean room facing the canal on the second floor - it was a beautiful view of the city. Staff was very nice - everyone spoke English.Breakfast was included and was pretty good, eggs, lunch meats, fruit, cereal and really good coffee w/ a variety of rolls/bread. We had a blast in Amsterdam, partly due to the great hotel - 3 stars, but a very high 3 stars. The hotel is right in the center of the city - perfect location. I love Amsterdam! ',GOOD,
'Terrific Hotel, great location We loved this small hotel and its terrific location. The room was small but clean and modern with a more than adequate bathroom. The staff was very friendly, helpful and obliging. We liked being near many attractions and wonderful restaurants. The two recommended by the staff were really good. It was very quiet and the buffet breakfast was certainly a good start to the day. To top it all off, the price was right!!! ',GOOD,
'Great hotel, very warm service! Just came back from a great weekend from Amsterdam.Last year I was also in Amsterdam, as I didn't know about the TripAdvisor website, I was very very dissapointed when chose the Y Boulevard hotel.This time I chose the hotel by the TripAdvisor website, and came out really pleased with the outcome.The hotel is very lovely, with canal view rooms, and the staff is very warm and ready to help in any issues.We came on wednesday (my girlfriend and I), and got twin beds room rather than a single double bed, on the first floor. The room also was inner one, without any view to the outside.When we told the receptionist that we would like a double bed room, she offered to move us immediately to other room (which was quite small), or to wait for another day and get a better room on one of the upper floors.We decided to wait and got the new room the day after, and it was a lovely room on the 4th floor (room #403), with a magnificent canal view.The hotel in general is very clean, and breakfast is quite good (although very basic one).The hotel location is absolutely great (5 minutes walk from the Dam square).I certainly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Amsterdam in a moderate budget (100-150 EURO).I'll visit this hotel again, for sure. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Hotel! I loved this hotel. Upon arrival we were given room #24. This room had a wonderful canal view, and was very spacious. Hotel staff was very helpful. Also room was very clean and nice. Even made a phone call home (using hotel's long distance) and the charge for the phone call was very reasonable. Great location, a wonderful hotel for the money. Will make sure to visit agian! ',GOOD,
'great location shame about canal repair work Just returned from 3 nights in lovely Amsterdam.Hotel was in a very nice location easy for walking to most of the squares yet not in a busy area.Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful which was good as we had to ask to be moved twice!First time was due to us being put in a smoking room which was unacceptable ,we were then moved to a nice room overlooking the canal which was great.The problem was that at just past 7.00am the next morning workmen started up with pneumatic concrete breakers just under our window ,what a racket!I informed staff and they said this work will be going on for a few months more ,anyway I asked to be moved again and was given a room on the 4th floor at the rear of the hotel which was fine.generally speaking the hotel is ok getting a little shabby and breakfast is not very inspiring(no variation at all)but as i said before staff and location are excellent. ',POOR,
'Great Location, Reasonable Price Stayed at the Rembrandt residence for 4 nights in March 2005. Having carefully weighed up all of the hotel options in Amsterdam via Trip Advisor I chose this property, namely because it seemed excellent value for somewhere so centrally located and because I needed a wi-fi Internet connection whilst in Amsterdam (which is specifically advertised on the hotel's own website).Having reserved a room by phone (and having been told that I would be allocated a wi-fi equipped room) we checked-in only to find that no wi-fi Internet access was available at all. The first receptionist said it may work, it may not. The next day a young lady on reception said Oh, here's a password, although I don't know much about it and it's only a trial anyway. And it normally doesn't work, while on the 3rd day yet another employee told us it hadn't been working for over a week (which meant that when I booked, staff most likely knew it didn't work but still reserved me a room on the basis that I wanted the Internet).In the end I made a trip each day to the Swiss'otel just off Dam Square and used their wi-fi service (which is reliable and reasonably fast).The hotel itself has nicely refurbished public areas and a ground floor breakfast room which is light and airy. However, once you open the door to head towards guest rooms, the hotel shows its true age, with fixtures and fittings that have not likely been updated since the late 80s. In some areas, there's also a stale smell that pervades the air, almost as if someone has been smoking (though we were on a non-smoking floor).Our room, which overlooked a small courtyard was clean and tidy, though on the small side. The bathroom was recently re-tiled though and equipped with a decent power shower (and plenty of hot water). Although not plush, we weren't disappointed given that accommodation prices in Amsterdam are on the high side.One thing of concern though was the state of the wiring in our room. On the first night my girlfriend plugged in her hair-dryer only to find that it immediately short circuited. We took it to be just bad luck as the TV (plugged into another wall socket) worked just fine. However, when checking-out I always have a quick look under the bed just to make sure no valuables/clothing have been left behind. Naturally I was somewhat amazed to see a wiring loom under the bed, with exposed wires and a lead that seemingly connected to electrical sockets behind the headboard. Fire or shock hazard? Well, I'm no electrician, but I've stayed in hotels good and bad and that's a new one on me.Other than that, breakfast provided us with an adequate selection to choose from, although traces of shell in the scrambled egg and poor washing of plates/cutlery confirmed that improvements are needed in some areas.All, in all, bearing in mind the price and location it was still a good deal, though with the problems/niggles that we experienced, on balance, I would be unlikely to choose the Rembrandt residence again. And that's a shame because for all of the faults described above, our room there was clean and tidy. ',POOR,
'Not that bad for a three star In staying at this hotel it has to be remembered that it is a three star hotel. With that in mind having stayed there in February 2005 i can say that the staff were very friendly and the rooms clean and appropriate for the level of the hotel. It is close enough to Dam Square and walking distance from the station depending on age. The breakfast was adequate for a three star hotel and there was enough food. I would stay again if i could not find a good deal on a 4 or 5 star hotel. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Stay in Amsterdam We had a very very nice stay in the Rembrandt Residence Hotel. We were given a very nice and clean room. The staff was very friendly, both at the reception and at breakfast. Everybody was very helpfull.We really recommend this hotel!Please see our photos. ',GOOD,
'i love this place! its great here! turn left for 5 mins and you're in leidesplein. turn right for 2 mins and its dam square! ann frank house just minutes away on foot, excellent choice of coffeeshops surrounding the area! the service is great, rooms are great. breakfast basic but plentyful! i highly recommend this hotel and will always come back here. ',GOOD,
'lovely, quiet, perfect       entrance to hotel ',GOOD,
'Ok Having been before I was disappointed, as was my girlfriend, with the size of the room. No cat with us and probably a good job as we would not have been able to swing it! Bed pushed against wall and whilst I would not consider myself a waif or supermodel size two people could not walk past each other at any point in the room.Breakfast has not changed, basic stuff and only the one warm item (scrambled egg), not particularly good choice apart from the fruit juices. Coffee however was top drawer!Position is good as long as you do not mind a stroll into Dam Square or along the Herengracht for a tramStaff as good as ever and speak better English than most.If you want a cheap bit of food nip to the Albert Heijn food hall behind the royal palace, excellent fresh food selection and cheap as well. ',POOR,
'Hey Now! We consider ourselves very lucky to have chosen this hotel. We were given one of the nicest rooms in the hotel with a canal view. Very spacious, tons of closet and storage space and high ceilings. I believe there are only a few of these rooms, so make sure you request a canal view. The staff were very nice and helpful in directing us on things to do and see. We stayed for an entire week and the only complaint we had s the breakfast. It is not up to American standards. If breakfast is not your biggest concern, than I highly recommend the Rembrandt Residence. ',GOOD,
'A Masterpiece We stayed at the Rembrandt for 2 nights on the 27th and 28th December. We booked over the internet so were not sure if everything would be ok when we arrived. Our fears were put safely to rest when we arrived and we given a spectacular room facing a canal. To cater for our party of four (2 adults and 2 children) they provided us with 2 double beds and a fold out queen size beds, which was perfect. We had 3 huge windows where we could sit and watch the bikes past and the reflections of the twinkling lights in the canals. In terms of location, we walked to everything, very close to Dam Square and to the Anne Frank Museum. The breakfast was ample and typical of the European style. Service was efficient and professional. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! ',GOOD,
'Great experience at Rembrandt Residence We stayed here for 4 nights in December and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is centrally located and overlooks canals in back and front. It consists of a series of canal houses, so it has character. Our room was spacious, clean and quiet, with a large bathroom (even by American standards). The staff was very friendly and helpful. We will stay here again. ',GOOD,
'great room, location, view, but really lousy breakfast We stayed in the Rembrandt Residence from Boxing Day 2004 for 3 days. We had asked for a canal view and we got it, looking out over Singel Canal. The room amenities were basic, they were cleaned everyday and it was a great base to investigate the city. There is loads to see and do within walking distance. It's about a 15 minute stroll to Centraal Station along the canals. Our only complaint was the standard of the breakfast - very poor choice and very little of what there was. Not worth paying any extra for! Cold scrambled eggs, 2 or 3 cereals, a few semi-fresh rolls and about half a jug of orange juice, not to mention the coffee. And there was absolutely no point in arriving after 9am as the room filled up very quickly and there was a really long queue! Not whatwe wanted to do first thing in the morning, and frankly the food wasn't worth the wait. So we ate out the last 2 days we stayed there and it was much better. ',POOR,
'Great base We've just spent three nights at the Rembrandt Residence and couldn't fault it. Although we were up in the attic the room was large, clean and comfortable. It's a really great base for seeing everything - most places are within easy walking distance. Breakfast was plentiful and, even when we were very late, there was fresh coffee, bread, etc. Staff were very helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Only downside was that we didn't have a canal view but then we weren't spending much time looking out of the window! ',GOOD,
'Going Dutch!! This is a charming, 3 star, canal-side hotel in central Amsterdam, a few minutes walk from Dam Square and therefore, most of Amsterdam's tourist attractions. First impressions of the hotel are favourable. The foyer/reception area is very pleasant and the staff are both friendly and helpful. There are approximately 75 rooms, spread over 4 floors - the upper floors being accessible by elevators. Our double room on the 4th floor was reasonably spacious with double bed, bedside tables, wardrobe, dressing table, occassional table and satellite television, with the option for pay-as-you-go private channels, should the regular fare not be to your taste!! The bathroom was small, comprising of wc, washbasin and bath with overhead shower. There was a plentiful supply of piping hot water all day long. Towels, toiletries and bed linen were refreshed daily. Being on the top floor of a traditional canal side building, there were two wooden beams which intruded somewhat into the room space. I presume that this would be the same in all of the rooms on the top floor, but this is a part of the character of the building. Canal-side rooms have french windows which open out and overlook the charming Herengracht Canal, so, if you have the option, I recommend you request a room with a canal view. The room charge included breakfast, which was served in the pleasant breakfast room at canal level. It was a typical continental buffet-style breakfast, comprising of the usual, cereal, yogurts, ham and cheese, scrambled/boiled eggs, fresh fruit, a variety of breads and fruit juices and coffee/tea. More than enough for the average person! If you are intending to visit Amsterdam, I recommend you sample this hotel which is good value for money. ',GOOD,
'Charming Location My first Time in Amsterdam  it wont be the last. I found the hotel to be in a great location next to all the sights yet keeping its charm. The staff where very helpful  although the rooms (we stayed in rm 109) where a little small the canal view made up for this. My husband  I are planning to visit again soon with friends I have no problem reccomending they book here which says it all really. Thanks to all at this hotel for a wonderful break. Cant wait to see again soon ',GOOD,
'Great location, great value Stayed in the Rembrandt Residence on business in October 2004. The hotel is in an excellent location, being no more than 5 minutes walk from Dam Square. What adds to the attraction is its location on a quiet street, so there is little chance of a traffic filled nights sleep. The rooms are of excellent quality for a three star hotel, and the staff are very helpful. What's more unlike many similar hotels the quality of the foyer area follows through to the bedrooms. Too often you are let down once the lift doors open on your room floor. Unlike other reviews I found the breakfast a little disappointing, but overall for the price paid, service offered and the quality of the room I had I was well impressed. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. ',GOOD,
'Lovely view over the canal - would stay there again! I have stayed at this hotel on two occasions now, and cannot praise the quality of the rooms enough. On both occasions I have stayed in rooms overlooking the canal, and although so close to dam square, the location is peaceful and picturesque. The quality of the breakfast is a bit bland, but a small price to pay for good quality at slightly cheaper prices. I look forward to my next visit. ',GOOD,
'Lovely Excellent value for a 3 star hotel. Spacious, clean room, comfortable beds. Staff were really helpful and friendly. Nice big breakfast room with plenty of choice. Would definitely return. ',GOOD,
'Lovely Stay Have just come back from a 4 night stay at this hotel. The hotel is easy to find and is in a very good location. It is right by a canal and not too long a walk from the station. It's in a nice quiet area but within walking distance of all the attractions.We were very impressed with the room. It was a very nice size - quite a large room - larger than some places we've stayed in. It was very clean and well kept. Breakfast was very nice. Something for everyone. Staff were very friendly and helpful. No restaurant but they do a very nice room service with plenty of choice. I looked at the outside of some of the other 3 star hotels in Amsterdam as we were walking past to compare and I have to say this hotel looked like it was one of the best ones. I would happily go back and stay in this hotel. ',GOOD,
'great place just back from a great break in the dam there were 10 in our group and we were all impressed by the standard of the hotel. the rooms were a great size and very comfy beds! the breakfast was lovely with plenty of variety yum! good location close to all major places of interest great time had by all!!! ',GOOD,
'small room big billl We recently spent two nights at The Rembrandt Hotel having not been to Amsterdam for a few Years.The location of the hotel is excellent just far away from the Damrak and red light district ...and the area has a gentle quiet air with a number of bars and restaurants within an easy stroll.Upon entering the hotel the staff were curtious and polite and we were given a room on the third floorwhich i can only describe as smaller than my garden shed .The roo was clean and neat but I spoke to the reception who were unable to offer me a larger room until the following night.They were very nice but I was under the impression this complaint occurs on a regular occasion ..Even a discount on what i considered a hefty rack rate for a hotel of this quality was not offered and the following day we were given a bigger room with a great view (Room 401 403 405 ) and descending floors will all be bigger rooms so try and specify a room when booking..Breakfast was standard and in buffet style.Overall it was a pleasant stay but the rooms are a let down so if its a special occasion pay a bit more for a room...  ',GOOD,
'Above Average Stayed here in February, 2004. The location is convenient to everything. Most everything is walking distance, but it you do not wish to walk, Dam Square, and its trams to everywhere, are very close. The canal side location is nice. It is quiet, and the staff was pleasent. It is not 5 star, or even 4 star. The rooms are small, sparse and old, but Amsterdam is so great we did not really care. Be careful. The canals look pretty much the same so it is easy to get lost, even when sobor. ',GOOD,
'Two days' stay in this hotel Breakfast more than average (poor choice, eggs without bacon, no variety (each morning exactly the same things) staff rather unfriendly), plastic egg holders (never seen these before).At departure, nobody asked whether we had appreciated our stay, which should be a standard question and nothing more than polite.The cleaning of the (very small) rooms started early in the morning with the noise of dust cleaners and the smashing of doors, which made it impossible to sleep until 8.30 hours.The hotel was in general ok, but did not leave an overwhelming impression, more the opposite, without wanting to be too negative.The rooms were very little and not luxuoury. Very small bath room, no hairy dryer; no radio nor clock in the room.It is clear that this hotel is visited by tourists who stay once in their life in Amsterdam. I would be surprised if many people choose for a regular stay at this place. ',POOR,
'Canal location incredible I stayed in the Rembrant Residence in February, 2004 for several days. This is a charming hotel, with lovely staff for the most part. The waiter in the small bar in the lobby was most polite and attentive. The location on the canal is breath-taking. We throughly enjoyed the breakfast, which was plentiful and tasty. My only complaint was that I asked how to utilize the phone to call long distance using my calling card. The clerk at the hotel, whom I asked gave me the wrong information, resulting in my being charged more than 40 Euro's in long distance charges to be paid to the hotel, in addition to being charged on my calling card. The instructions written in the room regarding long distance calling was totally vague. When I questioned my bill, it was the only time I saw staff members become extremely hostile and uncooperative. Of course, this left such a bad feeling that I refused to stay at the hotel on my return trip later this Spring. ',POOR,
'Excellent hotel We stayed for 2 nights in late Feb 2004. Staff were most helpful. Provided a no smoking room, gave us a view of the canal, even arranged the loan of a modem adaptor so that we could connect our laptop to the internet in the conference room downstairs. Room was clean and, although not large, was adequate in size. Breakfast was continental and plentiful. Dam square is less than a 10 min walk. Several good restaurants in the immediate area. Overall a very comfortable and pleasant stay. Recommended. ',GOOD,

'Too Noisy Impossible to sleep There were parties going all night. Not just until 12 or 1 AM but all night. They were in the rooms and in the hallway. We did not sleep at all. Management did nothing to stop it. This hotel is obviously for young people in groups. The room was interesting and VERY CLEAN. The retro look was nice. But I would never go back. I need to sleep. By the way,the bed was very comfortable and would have been great if sleeping was possible. ',POOR,
'Nice location in Belltown       view from Sound View Suite ',GOOD,
'This is not a nice hotel This is highly overrated on the internet. The pictures you see aren't what you get in your room. I booked this hotel months in advance asking for a quiet room for pre cruise and post cruise stay. We arrived at the hotel which is in an okay neighborhood with close proximity to the cruise ships. The hotel entry is a small door at the side of the restaurant. It is difficult to find. You have to walk up two flights of stairs with your luggage in tow both on your way in and out of the hotel lobby. The hotel staff is not courteous. They never once asked us if we needed anything. The staff at the front desk can hear you hauling your luggage into and out of the lobby . They are oblivious. The room was dirty and depressing and not quiet. We were on the waterfront side. Huge ventilator fans were everywhere. There were water stains on the furniture. The hotel had a very seedy motel feel. For $300 a night we got taken.We cancelled our reservations and stayed at the Marriott waterfront at the end of the cruise which I would recommend. We got concierge class and a very quiet room with a beautiful view in a better area of town for a few dollars more! ',POOR,
'Comfortable and Convenient This place has a Bed and Breakfast vibe with hotel conveniences. It is centrally located and at the edge of the Free Zone for downtown buses, but within walking distance to the Pike Place Market and other attractions. I booked a Belltown Suite at a lower rate with the forewarning from this website that it could get noisy on weekends - Friday night was no problem.The concierges were helpful. The room service from the restaurant was awesome. The only issue was that all of the towels were not always replaced daily. ',GOOD,
'Doesn't live up to its hype We visited Seattle on a working vacation trip. We initially had difficulty finding a room as it is the height of the cruise season. We were happy to find something available at The Inn at El Gaucho and based on what we saw on their website, we were looking forward to our stay there. We were, however, very disappointed as other than the fact that the rooms were nicely furnished, everything else about our stay did not live up to the hype given on the website. We stayed at El Gaucho for three nights and so probably were able to get a good feel for the service there. The website advertises that there will be a staff person to help carry luggage up to their second floor lobby. The problem with that is that there is no way to let them know that you have arrived so that they can send someone down to help. Most people don't want to leave their luggage unattended downstairs to inform the desk of their arrival as the first floor entry is not secure. The continental breakfast was sparse. One morning they were especially low. Even though we were one of the first to come to breakfast, upon finding that they were out of some items, we asked at the front desk if they could replenish. We were told that they were all out of a particular item. No offer was made to get some more or offer to get something else. No one kept watch on the breakfast area to keep things refilled on a regular basis even though it is right next to the front desk. The only thing done to our room by housekeeping was to make our bed (even though we pretty much made it first). The shower rug, which we hung over the door to dry, was taken down, rolled up and placed on the floor while still wet. Bathroom supplies were not replenished regularly to the point that we had to get some ourselves off of the maid's cart. No one ever checked with us to see how we were enjoying our stay nor have we heard back from them since as we have from other hotels that we stayed at on this particular trip. ',POOR,
'Cool Vibe       Nice big room; very clean. Awesome bed. ',GOOD,
'Politely Overrated If you are looking for a completely different overnight experience this is your place. My wife and I enjoy coming to Seattle for the occasional overnight night stay. We have been to the resturant El Gaucho several times and have always enjoyed it. This time we decided to book a reservation with the hotel as well. The staff was very accomodating and nice, however the facility was a different story.To be completely honest the room reminded me of cheaply remodeled college dorm. It's obvious that this inn used to be a low rent apartment building. There are large gaps under each door where light comes in. The AC units are small and inadequate. The street noise is intolerable. (We were awakened by two homeless men fighting.) The beds are motel hand me downs on wheels with nice sheets. Be prepared to pay too much and be awakened through out the night, by external and internal noise. Also the neighborhood is completely filled with transients asking for money.Pay the extra $100 and stay at the W. ',POOR,

'Great place to stay in Seattle       Atrium bathroom ',GOOD,
'Not a lot of service, but a really nice room We stayed at the Inn at El Gaucho for 4 nights recently. The location is great for restaurants, Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, the Olympic Sculpture Park, and other attractions. We didn't have a car and were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go.We actually stayed in 2 different rooms because we came for 3 nights then went away for a side trip and came back for 1 night. One was on the interior and thus was a little dark (it overlooked a small courtyard) but very quiet. The other was on a corner overlooking 1st  Wall and there was tons of natural light, which was nice, but there was a lot of street noise. I live in New York and am used to street noise but I couldn't have slept with the windows open. The best thing about both rooms was the beds. I honestly think those were the 2 most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. We didn't ever want to get out! There was also a nice little office space in each room where you can set up a laptop. Internet access is free with a username and password provided by the desk.The bathrooms were quite small and left a lot to be desired. We requested a tub and had one in each room. This is not a tub for a luxurious long soak, but it's clean and you can take a bath. There is no counter-space--a pedestal sink. While overall the bathroom was clean the floor was very dingy and dirty in both rooms. White tiles seem to have been a bad choice. If you need much in terms of service (concierge, valet, bellman), you won't get it at the Inn at El Gaucho. The front desk staff, while pleasant, seemed a little clueless, with the exception of one gentleman who worked evenings during our stay. He was friendly and really helpful and knew his job. On the other hand, you aren't paying for this. With rates of about $175-185 this was the best value for a good hotel that I could find in Belltown/Downtown, and the room is more than adequate. That bed alone is worth the price. We both agreed we would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Loved It!!!! Thank you Trip Advisor for leading us to the Inn at El Gaucho! My husband was in Seattle on business and since I was tagging along on this trip, we wanted to stay somewhere more interesting than a typical chain hotel and we were certainly not disappointed. Our room was fabulous! The bed was super comfortable, we loved having a sitting area and my husband appreciated the work space complete with free wireless. I am not a big beef eater, so we skipped the restaurant, although it smelled wonderful and it the atmosphere seemed very inviting. We did however take advantage of the very hip movie theater/bar in the basement of the hotel. The bartenders were very friendly and we loved that they would run cocktail refills to us during the show! The other great thing about this hotel, was the location. If we had been staying further in the downtown area, we would have missed out on all of the great restaurants and shops on 1st Ave. Many of the main tourist attractions are within easy walking distance, like Pike St Market, the downtown shopping district, the Space Needle, Argosy cruises, Pioneer Square etc...and as an added bonus, the Olympic Sculpture Garden is just a few blocks away and is the start of a beautiful waterfront trail for cycling or jogging in the mornings. The only negatives that I can come up with would be the stairs leading into the Inn as mentioned in many other reviews and the somewhat confusing air conditioner. However, the stairs really are not that big a deal if you are prepared for them and the man at the front desk gave me a quick air conditoner tutorial that solved that mystery. All in all, it was a fabulous stay and I would highly recommend the Inn at El Gaucho! Cheers! ',GOOD,
'Great Find, Great Location, Great Steak I was in town last week for business and had trouble finding a room due to a MSFT conference. I had already booked dinner at El Gaucho Steakhouse (some say the best steak in the country) and noticed they had 18 rooms upstairs. Great find! 3 years old, all suite hotel with 18 rooms and free breakfast and wi-fi, not to mention bottle of water cookie and CD. Plasma screen, Bose CD player and a comfy bed are a few of amenities along with friendly service and leather couches. I did notice their pricing varied from their site and Expedia (much less expensive) so I called reservations direct and they offered an even better rate. Good to note a great wine store and Kinko鈥檚 are a block away as well as Pikes Place Market and the waterfront. ',GOOD,
'Elegantly Comfortable Inn with Personal Service I spent a night at the Inn while in Seattle for an interview. After a long travel day and a long interview, I was welcomed at the curb outside of the Inn and restaurant by the valet, who surprised me by welcoming me by my first name. Talk about personal service!The front desk staffperson (Teresa) was equally welcoming and warm. She personally took me to my room, which was beautiful, luxurious, comfortable, and just the right size for me. Complimentary robes of the softest cotton, fabulous linens and towels, plasma tv, complimentary CD of jazz (the steakhouse has a jazz piano player most nights), a view of the Sound, ceiling fan, plump pillows, and room service from the steakhouse all made it a perfect way to relax after the long day.The decor of my room felt like New Mexico crossed with the '50s, retro swank is a good way to put it! On the walls were a black and white photograph of Frank Sinatra (The Classic Age of Jazz by Gottlieb, famous photo) and a photo of Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina. Classy!I booked the Inn through an expedia package and chose it because of its proximity to my interview and because it looked like a place where a woman traveling alone would feel safe. I like being known by the staff. Really a great choice. I will be back.The only negative was a car alarm going off early in the a.m., but that is not the fault of the inn! ',GOOD,
'Not all that was expected. My wife  I stayed 1 night for Valnentines. We do a diferent hotel in the Seattle area each year for the past 11 years. Of all he hotels over the years this was at the bottem of the list. No elevators,had to walk up a flight of stairs to reach registration. Staff were very nice, room was O.K. the colours of Orange  red were not my wife's fav. There was a noisy heating unit that ran most of the night by the room window. When I went out the next morning for the contental breakfast there were 3 pastries left, no butter, out of cream  coffee. the staff did get these corrected. for $325 for te night + $25 parking there are at least 10 other options we know of that provide much better value. On the positive side the bed was very comfortable, we had a suite which we reserved  this was roomy ( Not as roomy as most other hotel suites we have experienced.) the bathroom was small but well decorated. the gowns provided were very comfortable. ',POOR,
'Great location, overwhelming smell of steak Going into this trip, I knew the inn was located over a steak house, but I didn't fully realize the implication that my room would smell like grilled meat.I agree with all of the wonderful reviews written here. Incredible location, great interior design, comfortable beds, staff that was pretty friendly. All of these things were good but the overwhelming smell of steak that permeated our room in the evening overshadowed the positive aspects for me. ',POOR,
'intimate stay in the city My wife, Judy, and I recently stayed in Seattle and Portland, and had a wonderful trip. We chose to stay at the inn at el gaucho, at the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say that it was a good choice. We were right downtown in Belltown, but felt that we were staying with friends. The staff was friendly, always there, and we felt safe and welcomed. Our room was a jr suite, with a view of the bay. The bed was comfy, amenities were great, and espresso at Macrina was just a one block walk in the morning. All in all, a most restful and enjoyable stay. ',GOOD,
'Something a little different I stayed here for 3 nights in December 2007. First impressions were great, at check-in we were upgraded from the cheapest room to the most expensive. Always a lovely thing to happen. The hotel was very quiet - only saw one other couple during our stay. The rooms were super comfy - one of the comfiest beds I have slept in, big leather sofas, lovely toiletries, Bose CD player with complimentary CD - jazz, very mellow.Reception staff unobtrusive but very helpful when looking for information about Seattle - running routes, opening times etc.A short walk to Pike Place market, 1st Starbucks, stores about a 10-15 minute walk. Lovely pizza place open across the road from hotel - they do take-out. yum.The breakfast is a bit pitiful. Coffee, fruit and pastries. But so many places around the hotel it was not a concern. Also no cookies :( A bonus would have been a small 'fridge in the room. A great and comfy place to stay in central-ish Seattle. A really nice place to come back to when you have been out shopping/doing tourist stuff all day.(Have a meal up the Space Needle, then entry to the top is free, nice food, fantastic views and great service.)Would be glad to stay here again! Above average for the price. ',GOOD,
'Deilightful Surprise I booked the Inn at El Gaucho because it's located near the ferry line to Victoria. We had 1 night and very little time in Seattle, but I wish we could have stayed longer - the Inn at El Gaucho is delightful. Thebed is great! Add to that good electronics and bath stuff and it was hard to leave - I'm really sorry to have missed the breakfast. ',GOOD,
'Everything written in these reviews is true! My wife and I stayed for three nights after a cruise to Alaska. I'm late in writing the review as we stayed at the beginning of August. We chose the Inn based on the reviews in Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed at all. It was a fantastic room, perfect location for walking to Pike's Market or the Space Needle. Found a great breakfast spot 2 blocks away, C J's Eatery. Even the Cyclops across the street had great food and a fun spot to sit outside with a drink.Love this hotel and would stay again without hesitation! ',GOOD,
'Wonderful spot in Seattle My fiance and I just returned from a four day stay at the Inn at El Gaucho. Having used tripadvisor to find this spot, I wanted to write a review to confirm that this is a GREAT PLACE to stay in Seattle. The hotel is located in a great neighborhood--Belltown--near everything, and the restaurant below the hotel is one of the best steak restaurants I have ever been. The room was nice, and the bed was amazing. Our trip was interesting b/c I was on crutches with a hurt ankle, but the staff at El Gaucho did everything possible to make it easy on us (despite the fact that there are only stairs and no elevators). In sum, if you are looking for a cool boutique hotel with friendly, helpful staff, stay here. We loved it. ',GOOD,
'Is it possible to be too boutique? I had a great stay a the El Gaucho. Before I get to what I consider to be down-sides, I'll give you the high notes. The bed was wonderful, probably best I've ever slept in, certainly better than any chain hotel, Kimpton properties and the Westin/W included. The towels and bathrobe were very soft (although the towel didn't absorb water as well as I expected it would). The high definition television with loads of hi-def and premium channels was a nice perk. In general, you can tell the hotel put a lot of considerations into the furniture in the room. There is also free wireless. There was a great shower head in the shower. Lastly, the hotel has arranged for free use of the Seattle Athletic Club (although this is not very close to the hotel). The wine glasses and water glasses (with corkscrew) was a nice touch.On the downside: I'd consider the bathroom average. Nothing was wrong with it, but it came across as an afterthought compared to the rest of the room. The ironing board was miniature - I had to sit down to iron my shirt. For the price of a nights stay, I would expect a full-size ironing board. Lastly, while the staff was very professional and personable, they were apparently stretched thin. I called the front desk three times in ten minutes to set up a wakeup call and got the hotel voice mail every time. I ended up leaving a voice mail but never got the wakeup call I requested. There's also a long flight of stairs to the hotel lobby. I guess there's supposed to be a bellman to carry up luggage, but that didn't happen when I arrived.I guess the bottom ine is that while this is an excellent boutique property, it is small to the point of not being able to cater to the guests as much as a larger luxury/ boutique hotel. With only 18 rooms, the staff will call you by name and establish a rapport with you, but they may not be able to pick up the phone when you call. ',GOOD,
'Will stay again I stayed at The Inn at El Gaucho for two nights during a weekend trip to Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised by the intimacy of the room. A complementary bottle of Evian water, a fresh cookie, and cd of local artist sat on the dresser. the room was adorn with fresh cut flowers, leather furniture and one of the most comfortable beds I鈥檝e yet to sleep on in a hotel. The staff was amazing even at 3 in the morning there was someone at the desk. My only complaint was valet parking. at 25 dollars for 24 hours(a moderate price) we were surprised to find our car was parked on the street overnight I was hoping for something a little more secure. Also, because there wasn鈥檛 a permanent attendant on duty, we had to track down the receptionist to locate and bring our car. This was hardly a problem though because she always made it a priority to meet our needs. ',GOOD,
'comfortable and welcoming. we stayed three nights at the inn at el gaucho. we booked the cheapest room, ranging from $175 to $195 per night, and had a view of the street. my request for a room with a bath tub was honored. the room was comfortable, and we enjoyed our time there.we particularly liked: the super-soft bath robes, the high quality towels (not regular scratchy hotel towels), the l'occitane and philip b. bath products, the books about seattle and the area on the table in the room, and the endless supply of hot water coming from the shower.i didn't like that there was no mini bar because exploring it is one of my favorite parts of staying in a hotel (coke in a glass harmonica, anyone?) but there's a convenience store across the street for late-night snacks.nobody bothered us for anything during our entire stay. we saw another guest only one time, and he was on his way out. the concierge helped us find places to eat when we asked. maid service was quick and efficient. we left the room for 30 minutes and returned to find it completely spotless.they have free wi-fi, but to log in i would've had to call the concierge for a password, and it was easier to use the unlocked wi-fi from the ace hotel across the street.also, it's true: they give you cookies. really good cookies. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful experience at the Inn at El Gaucho! My husband and I stayed one night at the Inn at El Gaucho during an overnight trip to Seattle. We were thrilled. Our room (Sound view) was beautifully decorated, even better than described on the website, and incredibly comfortable to spend time in. The location of the Inn is also ideal鈥攁n easy walk to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and countless restaurants. We also walked to the pier to watch the sunset鈥攂eautiful! We had an excellent dinner at the Frontier Room just down the street鈥攈ighly recommended for those who might enjoy a cold beer, hot plate of ribs, and very cool atmosphere (and seriously the best fries ever). The service at the Inn was excellent鈥攅veryone was extremely helpful. We truly had a wonderful experience and will DEFINITELY stay at the Inn at El Gaucho the next time we visit Seattle. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful! This hotel is a hidden gem! We loved it. It was modern, spacious, clean, and romantic. I would recommed this hotel and will stay there in the future. ',GOOD,
'Location, location, location This hotel is all about location. Belltown has few hotels. Two blocks from the water, 4 blocks to Pike Market, 4 blocks to downtown. Rooms are spacious and lots of extras, but not terribly clean and lots of dings. Service was mixed with only one person at the desk at a time. Biggest downside is the smell--the hotel is above legendary steakhouse El Gaucho. By 6:00 the entire hotel including your room smell like cooking food. ',POOR,
'Marvelous! But don't pay extra for the views We had a wonderful stay in the beautiful Inn at El Gaucho. The location couldn't have been better 鈥?just a short walk from Pike's Market, and lots of restaurants and cafes. The rooms were plush and comfortable, with lovely pampering touches including a gift bag complete with chocolate chip cookies!The concierge service was amazing. every request was handled quickly and thoroughly.But don't bother paying extra for views of Pugent Sound. We could indeed see the water, but it's hardly stunning and you need to peer past several industrial rooftop air conditioning units on the neighboring buildings. Not worth the extra money. ',GOOD,
'Seattle Secret One of my best friends turned me on to the Inn at El Gaucho. The Inn is above the ever-popular Steak House. The hotel is small, well appointed with high quality furniture, flat-screens, and crisp sheets. The staff is helpful and caring. My corner suite overlooked the bay. This is a great place to stay on a business trip if you do not need all the features of a full service property. ',GOOD,
'El Gaucho is great Stayed at the Inn at El Gaucho for only one night (unfortunately). It is a great little find thanks to TripAdvisor. I was in town on business during a very busy convention week and all major hotels were booked up. Glad this happened or I would not have experienced this hotel. All the reviews and pictures are accurate. Small hotel but had all the five star touches of high end hotels: large room, modern bathroom, plasma TV, BOSE sound system, first class toiletries, free internet, beautiful bed, and relatively quiet despite being in a very busy part of town. Easy walk to waterfront, space needle and shopping. Staff was great, loved the goodie bag. All this for a very reasonable price ($175) compared to the other downtown Seattle hotels. I will definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Quiet Oasis In Belltown! When I told my husband the name of the hotel we were staying at he laughed so hard, I thought he was going to drive off the road. Okay, the name is a little strange, but the rooms are great. I have booked some very shady hotels in the past, so my hubby was a little nervous about what the El Gaucho would be. We wanted to stay in Belltown, and this is on the far end of Belltown, closer to the spaceneedle, so it is perfect for walking to both locations. It is also an easy walk to Pike Place Market. I simply could not believe how quiet our room was. It was like our own little oasis! There are only a few (16, I think) rooms in the entire hotel, and we never saw another guest. The valet parking was a little strange (the garage is a few blocks away), but at least they have it, and our car was secure. If the valet is not outside, you have to walk in and go up the stairs to the front desk. Stairs a problem? Not for us. We are in our 30's. The flatscreen is good, and we never had any problems with the stations, there were enough for us. There is also a bose sound system. The bathroom shower is small, but I didnt' care. The decor is artsy, picture of James Dean on our wall, and the warm colors are relaxing. I wanted to take the couch home! There are room darkening blinds/curtains that are so good, that you can easily sleep in after a night on the town in Belltown. I really loved this place, and the cookies were yummy! Highly recommended. We will probably stay here every time we visit Seattle from now on. ',GOOD,
'A Seattle gem in the Emerald City..... During our trip to Seattle and Vancouver last summer we agonized over finding the right hotel in Seattle for our 4 day stay. Thumbing through our Frommers guidebook we stumbled across the Inn at El Gaucho. We are glad we stumbled upon this gem of a hotel.Located just off the main downtown area of Seattle - the hotel is well located. The El Gaucho Steakhouse is located on the first floor and unbelievably a movie theatre is located in the basement. The hotel is on the top floor and the only real downside is no elevator the stairs are a steep hike. The front desk is staffed by one person and you basically have the feel of a tiny boutique hotel or inn.The room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed, big bedroom, and sitting area. A CD of the band that plays the steakhouse was gift waiting for us with chocolate chip cookies - when we walked into our room on the first day.I suspect this hotel is little known but really gave us a good feel for what living in Seattle is like. I do not recommend this hotel for older travellers - and emphasize going up and down the stairs was sorta of a hassle. Nonetheless, this is a memorable hotel/inn and recommend it highly. ',GOOD,
'Brilliant Hotel in a Great Location Just returned from a week in Seattle staying at the El Gaucho. Hotel was in a good location just a few blocks walk to the centre and the Space Needle. Local buses are free so handy if you dont feel like the walk. The hotel was excellent, staff very friendly and helpful. The bed was one of the most comfortable I ve ever slept in, made it difficult to get out of bed in the morning, especially if you are watching the Plasma TV. Rooms spotless with high quality bedlinen towels toiletries etc. No elevator/lift but only 2 gentle flights of steps and staff on hand to carry suitcases on arrival and departure. Seattle was bright and sunny for the week, perfect weather, great sights to see, including Space Needle although highlight was Sea Plane flight over Seattle. The basketball was also a very entertaining night out. A fantastic week, enhanced by staying in this brilliant hotel ',GOOD,
'Fabulous room, fantastic restaurant, amazing people We arrived at Inn at El Gaucho on 30th December after a very long flight from Glasgow, carrying way too much luggage. The doormen were quick to open our cab door and take our luggage up the stairs to our suite. The decor is unlike anywhere we've ever been - rustic but in a contemporary style. It's cosy, with rough plastered walls, ceiling fans and sumptuous brown leather sofas.The room was large, warm and welcoming, with a goodie bag including a CD of music by the musicians who perform in the restaurant below (quality jazz). The bed was fitted out in luxurious Egyptian Cotton sheets and offered us a truly comfortable night's sleep.Although it was late, we were welcomed into the gorgeous restaurant downstairs, and enjoyed a delicious meal served by the friendliest staff. We recommend you order a Spanish Coffee just to be entertained by the flames and sparks flying as it's made at your table... thanks to Correy who not only kept us laughing as he set fire to the table, but also advised us on where to go for the rest of our holiday - really appreciated! It's people like him who give a city a good name!The city was fabulous - so friendly and the shopping was great too. We haven't a bad word to say about the whole place. Thanks Seattle and all the staff at Inn at El Gaucho. ',GOOD,
'Great way to kick off our honeymoon!        ',GOOD,
'What, no elevator?! Once you have reached Reception - carrying your bags up two long flights of stone stairs, though there is a small goods elevator if you press the parking valet - your view of the place improves dramatically. The staff are professional and friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Rooms are stylish, large and comfortable.BUT what was that thundering noise at 5 a.m.?! For several seconds a building-shaking vibration rattled the solid walls (it happened to a lesser extent the second morning too - though not till around 6.........). Reception staff looked puzzled when asked about it, and professed lack of authority to discount our room charge on 7 a.m. check-out: 'I need to talk to my boss about that.....'. We're still awaiting the decision six weeks later!The Restuarant - clearly a cool destination, with prices at the high end - was good and the service attentive. Entrance to the building caters more obviously for the dining clientele than those sleeping at the hotel - but a good location, if they can just stop that infernal noise! ',POOR,
'Comfortable and affordable stay...right on 1st Avenue. I booked three nights at the Inn at El Gaucho based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com. When my boyfriend and I arrived after a 5 hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only 15 minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given 2 room keys, which is helpful. The room was a suite (they are all suites) facing 1st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a 40 TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and 2 ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee/office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down 1st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only 2 blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) Overall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($150 a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay! ',GOOD,
'Best place to stay in Seattle! We stayed at the Inn September 1st -3rd and then again on September 10th. The staff, location and well appointed rooms exceeded our expectations ( home for us is NYC). The food downstairs is awesome -- make sure to be extra hungry. Coffee shop around the corner on 2nd Ave. and Vine (Bellisimo) is fabulous as is Shiro's Sushi on 2nd Ave and don't miss brunch at Lola's. The staff assisted us in planning both Lake Union and Green Lake trips. We will most certainly stay here again. ',GOOD,
'The perfect place to stay!! Wow this is an amazing hotel. Very nice rooms as advertised. Loved the TV and the bed. Service staff was amazing. Very courteous and willing to help. It was hot and we had walked to the hotel from the Victoria Clipper(3 blocks, slightly uphill) and the hotel clerk gave me an extra bottle of water just because i looked thirsty. It is only a three block walk to the waterfront trolley(free ride to the stadium and downtown). It was about 3 blocks to the space needle and there is laundry service in the next block as well as many smaller unique bars and restaurants. I hope to stay here again in November!! Also the shower head was amazing.. so good in fact i bought the same one when i got home! ',GOOD,
'Nice hotel and Location We stayed for one night prior to taking an Alaskan cruise. Nice hotel although you would never know there was a hotel at this location as you see the restaurant first, then a small sign for the hotel entrance. Everyone is right about the stairs. No elevator for guests. There is a bell-person to take your bags, which was very worthwhile. The room is very nicely appointed. New furniture. Flat screen TV was a plus. Nice leather furniture in sitting area. But was disappointed in bathroom. Our bathroom was fairly worn. Marks on the walls and chips taken out of floor. It just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the room. Not impressed.Location was great. You can walk a few blocks down the street and run into many restaurants. Belltown seems to be getting fixed up. Lots happening and renovations going on to a number of buildings. Easy to get to any Seattle attraction. And a $5 cab ride to the cruise ship terminal.I probably would not stay there again. ',POOR,
'Outstanding Stayed at the El Gaucho for three days mid-August 2006. I travel frequently, stay at rather higher end hotels and B  B's. The reviews previously here were the only thing that led me to find this wonderful hotel. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The Inn itself is stylish, exceptional rooms that seduce you - very romantic, plush and at the same time comfortable. Beds, linens, pillows are awesome. Leather couches/chairs, plasma TV. Bathrooms as comfortable and stylish, amenities are great. The neighborhood is bustling, plenty of great eats, conveinent to Pikes Market, downtown, the waterfront and Seattle Center - all close walks. Neighborhood was safe, greatly so, for a large city due to the activity of cafes and restaurants. Note there is no elevator and a good set of stairs up, but the staff is very helpful. Valet parking was fine and not overly expensive or inconvenient for a city. I was greatly impressed and would make it my choice over Marriotts, Westins, Hiltons and the like for it's style and exclusive feel. ',GOOD,
'Viva El Gaucho!! My husband and I stayed here recently (along with 3 other couples) while we were in town for a wedding. The inn is both charming and unique, and different than what we expected. It definately has a retro feel, as evidenced by the small white tiled bathrooms, but with plenty of modern touches. While what one other reviewer said is true (about having to go up a flight a stairs), it didn't bother us or the rest of our friends. The beds were so comfortable, and we loved lounging on the leather furniture, watching our flat screen, and drinking wine out of Riedel glasses. We were given fresh chocolate chip cookies, a CD, and bottle of water at check in, which was a nice touch. We were escorted to our room and shown how each of our 4 remote controls work for different features in the room (fan, AC, stereo, TV). The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location is a short walk from Pike market. The rate of $169 (weekdays) was also much better than anything else comparable I came across in town. Try and visit the Music Experience Project by the Space Needle when in town, it's well worth the $20 entrance fee. Viva El Gaucho! ',GOOD,
'Outstanding in all areas I booked El Gaucho on the back of this site and was not disappointed. I couldnt think of a better place to arrive after a long haul from London. One of the most comfortable beds and duvets Ive ever had the pleasure to fall into, stylish decor and room layout, very usable flat screen and bose system.A traquil oasis of harmony right in the heart of bussling Belltown. Make your visit to Seattle complete and book it! ',GOOD,
'Disappointment at El Guacho We had high hopes for our stay based on the reviews we had read on this site. However, disappointment set in upon arrival. The hotel site does not mention that the only way to access the hotel is via long steep conccrete steps and that if you arrive at a non peak hour there may not be a valet out front to help park your car or take your bags up to the room. You have to trek up to the front desk and announce your arrival to set things in motion. We booked a sound view room and found that the view is over nearby roofs and fairly limited. If we had known how poor the view was, we would not have paid the premium. The first room we were given had some sort of loud mechanical noise above. The staff was very accomodating and immediately switched us to another room. That room, although rather small, seemed fine until the next morning when we discovered that the tub drain was extremely sluggish. It was to remain that way for our entire three night stay, despite requests each day to have it repaired. The rooms are clean and well appointed, however the queen bed seems small to those of us accustomed to king beds at other better hotels. The staff is extremely friendly but were unable to meet our request for tickets to a popular show playing the weekend we were there. Dinner reservations were made efficently, but feedback was not given that they had been made unless we asked. A phone call to the room confirming them would have been a nice touch. In summary - the staff is friendly and inspires confidence but the follow through is less than good. Decent value for the money, but not a place we would return to. ',POOR,
'Affordable Luxury! We love the Inn at El Gaucho! The Inn at El Gaucho was everything the reviewers here promised: clean, safe, luxurious, and affordable. We were greeted by a friendly valet and directed upstairs, where we met an equally friendly receptionist. We were too early to check in, so she arranged for the bellman to take our luggage and park our car. We decided to walk down to Pike's Place Market for lunch and were pleased to find that it was only a 10-15 minute walk (though be warned--there is at least one hill to contend with!). After lunch, we returned to get our key and were escorted to our room, where we found our bags and a lovely gift bag with water, two large chocolate chip cookies, and a CD of music. Our room was spacious and had a large, soft leather loveseat, chair, and ottomon, and the bed linens were incredibly soft. The ceilings were high with a celing fan as well as AC. The only small downsides to the room were a lack of windows (we were in one of the interior rooms with one window facing the tiny atrium) and the fact that the AC was sometimes a bit noisy. However, the Bose radio and the wall-mounted plasma widescreen TV were pleasant surprises.We love boutique hotels for their attention to each individual, and we weren't disappointed. This inn only has 19 rooms, and the staff treats everyone as an honored guest. Want coffee? Call the front desk, and chilled cream is brought to you. Want a massage? That can be arranged. The only downside to this luxury is that room service comes from the critically acclaimed El Gaucho Restaurant...which was much too pricey for our budget. Luckily, there are dozens of great restuarants, cafes, and coffee shops within walking distance, so this issue never became a problem for us.I highly recommend this inn--it was by far the most affordable of the deluxe downtown hotels, and we really enjoyed our stay. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Surprise I was searching online for a place to stay prior to our cruise.I came across the Inn at El Gaucho. We only stayed one night, but it turned out to be great. A room upgrade awaited us after a long plane flight. The evening lights across Puget Sound were beautiful.Attention to detail - fresh flowers, beautiful bed linens, comfy robe, etc.Our dinner at El Gaucho Restaurant was excellent. Conveniently located to Pike Street Market, waterfront, great shopping and restaurants. Definitely a little gem in a sea of hotel chains. ',GOOD,
'Great Experience! We stayed here for 4 nights total and had a great experience. The Inn was very clean, service was friendly and I would definitely reccomend this location and stay there again. This was a value! I only wish they offered King size beds and had a vending machine for cold drinks. That is the only thing I would change. This is in very close walking distance to all attractions! ',GOOD,
'The Worst Hotel Experience To Date I travel quite a bit for my work and was excited about visiting a new small boutique hotel. Especially after seeing the reviews on this site. I returned late last night and felt the urgent need to add my review as soon as possible as I was horrified by my experience and think people should know about it - especially in a city with so many other cute hotel options.We arrived at around 3PM on a Monday after driving around the block a few times as the hotel was almost completely inconspicuous. After finally finding the hotel and having to track down the valet we parked and made our way in. The valet asked if we wanted help with our luggage, which we declined since, we had very little luggage since we were only there for two nights. Quickly once we entered we realized there are two flights of stairs you have to climb in order to reach the reception/rooms (Not handicap accessible by any means). The valet came in and sniped at my associate and me 鈥渘ow that you see the stairs do you still not want any help with your luggage鈥? We thought it was a bit harsh but blew it off. We made our way to reception where we were greeted by the worst front desk manager ever! I had made the reservation over the phone and was quoted $180 for a Puget Sound View Junior Suite. When we checked in we were told the rate would be $235 and that they would not honor the previously quoted rate, even though we had our confirmation numbers. After about 20 minutes of arguing and her telling us that the entire city was sold out and that she would be happy to call some places and see about a reservation elsewhere and found that we could stay at the Westin for $259 (which has a gym, business center, 24 hr room service and mini bar 鈥?none of which El Gaucho has), she finally agreed to honor the rate we had been previously quoted. Not off to a great start and things continued to go wrong. This is a strange set up; it鈥檚 basically an 18 room Inn that has been built on the reputation of the steakhouse (El Gaucho, you might have presumed) below. It is a dark place with horrible lighting and gross orange and brown carpeting and orange walls. We could never find a valet to pick up or drop off our car. They said they were affiliated with a gym ($12/day to use) but they weren鈥檛 really sure where it was and when we went looking for it, we could not locate it at all (it鈥檚 more than 6 blocks away). On the last night I was there the toilet overflowed and there as no one the least bit capable of fixing it or even calling someone that could. I was asked on a number of occasions that night and in the morning what I had done to make this happen. The night manager told me that I would be given an additional discount for the inconvenience, as I had to switch rooms to the street side of the hotel. I then (in my pajamas) had to carry all of my stuff from one side of the hotel to the other at 11PM at night. In the morning when I checked out the same horrible front desk lady was there and actually managed to apologize about the toilet but then asked again what I had done to make it happen. When I mentioned that I had been told about the additional discount she questioned me about it and huffed at me and finally discounted it $20.00.For a hotel of this size which needs to be service oriented, this was a horrible dissapointment. ',POOR,
'Redefines the meaning of hospitality I booked a stay here as a surprise trip for my boyfriend's 30th birthday, and the hotel staff went above and beyond helping me plan everything. They arranged for private car service to and from the airport, the room was decorated with rose petals when we arrived, and the staff had selected a nice bottle of Mark Ryan Wild Eyed Washington Syrah for us. They also helped us schedule an in-room massage. Everything about the stay was wonderful -- I can't say enough about the service here. The hotel was quiet, the room was huge and luxurious (flat-panel TV with a bazillion channels, 300-thread count sheets, bath products from L'Occitane, the softest robes ever, even an umbrella for the Seattle weather, Riedel stemware for the wine -- and I'm a wine fanatic, so I was very happy about this). And the decor isn't cheesy, frou-frou bed-and-breakfast/grandma's attic stuff -- it's actually very chic -- leather furniture, paint in warm orange tones, etc. I loved it. And the location was great. We didn't have a rental car, so we just walked everywhere -- the hotel is really close to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle/Seattle Center/Experience Music Project, and Pioneer Square. And there are so many restaurants within walking distance (we love Restaurant Zoe and Lola). The nightlife is a little cheesy and touristy, but there are bars in the area. Overall, I highly, highly recommend the Inn at El Gaucho. This is a fantastic hotel. Clean, luxurious, great service, convenient location. ',GOOD,
'Cozy Room at the El Guacho My husband and I stayed at the Inn at El Guacho from June 21-23, after staying at the Hyatt days before on business, I wanted a hotel in a different part of the city and one that was not part of a chain. Come to find out the Inn is under the same ownership as the Hyatt. Anyway, the room was clean and it really had a cozy home feel. My husband didn't care of the overwhelming smell of food in the lobby, which was to be expected because it's above a steakhouse. However we couldn't smell it in the room. Also you could hear the band downstairs in the Pampas Room every night till 2 or so, if you're sensitive to that, but it didn't bother us too much. Upon check in the woman at the front desk forgot to mention that for $10 we could get a continental breakfast in our room (you have to arrange this the day before), so when morning came and we were looking for food, we were directed to a local bakery (Macrina) which was great and much cheaper. Loved the gift bag, the staff was fabulous, the robes were soft, the bed was comfortable, enjoyed the flat screen TV that you could move to watch in the sitting area or in bed! Belltown is a fabulous area. Great restaurants, nightlife, boutiques, and at the Inn you're just a few blocks down from the Free Bus Ride area, but we did a lot of walking. Overall, I would highly recommend the Inn at El Guacho! ',GOOD,
'Good, but.... Stayed there over a long weekend and I agree the service was friendly and attentive. Hotel is in a great location in Belltown, and it is located near many interesting shops and restuarants. I would give this place another try, but there were some things that could use improvement. To their credit, the staff tried to remedy my biggest complaint which was a very loud air condtioner that hissed, started, stopped, etc, every 2 to 3 minutes. When it was quickly obvious that their own maintenance staff could not fix it, they immediately called a professional who came out on that same Saturday to fix it...he kind of fixed of it, but even admitted that it was not completely right. For just under $200 bucks a night, the AC should work. Period. In addition, the toilet paper holder was falling off the wall and the remote (batteries?) died. Not all bath products were replaced and ran out of soap.Stairs are a pain to navigate, especially since you have run in and out as their no vending machines or gift shop to purchase water, snacks, etc located on the property.That's the rant. Here's the rave. Again -great location. Cool room, very different than most hotels. Nice furniture, ceiling fan (on a remote), Bose, Plasma, free wireless and nice gift bag when you arrive. Extra reading material in room (great cookbook, other Seattle information) is a nice touch as well. Extremely friendly staff.All in all, a nice stay - maybe just got a bum room, and would try again. ',GOOD,
'Stay at El Gaucho We were so pleased we decided on the Inn at El Gaucho. Fantastic service, very clean and tastefully decorated rooms. All the employees there are very helpful and friendly. The valet team lives by their company's motto Aggressive Service The hotel recommended a driver Asmelash K Bihen - Global Connection - 206-859-1181, be sure to use his services to and from the airport and any trips you might take around the area he is super!The hotel is located on the corner of 1st and Wall, at the edge of Belltown where tons of cafe's and bars are. It can get a little noisy on the weekends but we were able to sleep just fine. You can enjoy some interesting entertainment from the window, we wished the Inn would have balconies. We would have bought wine and sat out there and watched the people all night.They are located within easy walking distance of Pike's Market, and the Needle, a litte more of a hike to Pioneer Square. They do have steps up to the Inn, but aren't that big of a deal for those in good health. The night clerk thought the continental breakfast was being fazed out but the two times we requested breakfast, we received, and it was great! So double check if they are still offering this service, so you won't be disappointed.At the end of the day, you collapse into a wonderfully comfy bed. I thought I would never say this about a hotel bed....I miss that bed! ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel EVER! My husband and I stayed in one of the Belltown Junior Suites at the Inn for two days in April. Even though this room didn't have a view of the ocean, the room itself was absolutely beautiful - very clean, modern, it felt like coming home to a trendy apartment, not a hotel room. It is everything that the hotel website shows, and even more lovely!We booked on Seattle Super Saver and so for $155 + tax /nite, it was an excellent deal for the comfort we got - plasma TV, cd player, leather couches, feather duvet, bathrobes, etc, etc. And little perks like fresh tulips in the room and free bottled water and huge gourmet cookies when you arrive, were SO nice!The staff were all VERY friendly and willing to go the extra mile in whatever was necessary! And the location is excellent as well, within walking distance to many downtown attractions.We have stayed in more expensive hotels before, but no hotel has ever been as perfect as this! One thing to keep in mind is that there is only Valet parking, so that will cost a bit extra.I hope that we can definitely return again very soon! Thanks again to all the staff for such a wonderful stay! ',GOOD,

'Very good value for meoney We stayed at the Americania in october 2008. Ok, there are some funny characters in the neighbourhood, but if you mind your own business they will probably do the same.The hotelrooms are nicely decorated and comfortable enough for a cityhotel. Good beds, a good bathroom what do you need more?The hotel is on walking distance from downtown SF. We walked to Fishermans Wharf, China Town, Lombard street, The Art center etc. The staff is polite and is willing to help you.Ok, the parking is US$ 20 a day, but hey.....your in the big city.Go and park you car in Amsterdam, it will set you back EUR 5 per hour!!!!The Americania is a nice, and comfortable hotel on a good location and good value for money. ',GOOD,
'An affordable oasis in Union Square This hotel was above average in service, cleanliness and hospitality. This was not the ordinary hotel setting. The retro furnishings were different and fun. It was a refreshing break! We would stay here again! ',GOOD,
'Great Boutique Hotel This is a newly-renovated boutique hotel decorated in kitschy mid-century modern. Rooms are average-sized, but very comfortable and include a flat screen TV and a large shower (no bathtub in our room). There is a pool and a fitness room (bike, treadmill, elliptical--all new), both of which are well-maintained. The hotel is very centrally-located (though, as some have noted, this is not a 'hip' street with restaurants and shops...nearby Market St. and Yerba Buena Gardens can satisfy those needs, however).Were it not for the ridiculous parking fee, this hotel would be an excellent choice. The hotel charges guests $20/day (expensive even for SF), and then insults them by offering non-guests parking in the same garage at the rate of $5 to $8/day! Unbelievable, really. ',GOOD,
'Funky Bargain-Priced Gateway to SOMA For the price, this is a gem -- half or less than hotels blocks away with free parking and Internet access and a very friendly and responsive staff. The Americania has been remodeled in a funky, mid-century decor with a touch of deco and even a funky onsite hamburger joint called Custom Burger as well as an exercise room and outdoor pool.The good price is probably a product of location. The Ameritania IS a couple of blocks away from, SOMA's cultural attractions and into somewhat marginal territory in terms of street folks and such. But we were never made to feel uncomfortable. The one other drawback is a less than perfect air conditioning system, but the room windows open so there is a fresh air alternative that most hotel rooms lack these days. ',GOOD,
'Decent stay, very poor location, and a bad after-sales experience My brother and I stayed here for a few nights, and if it wasn't for the hotels location I would have probably enjoyed my stay a lot more than what I actually did. The hotel and room itself is what you would expect of any Best Western hotel - standard and fairly low cost. However, the staff seemed friendly enough and the rooms were clean. The beds were fairly comfortable, although you might want to bear in mind that I had been camping for the previous two weeks, so any bed was going to feel comfortable.  However, you would think that when building a hotel you would take it's location into consideration, and this is where most people criticise the hotel, and rightly so. San Francisco contains a lot of homeless people anyway, but there seemed to be more than usual around the area of the hotel. Although most homeless people are fairly harmless we were confronted by one man who started calling us racist (he simply based this on the fact that he was black and we wouldn't give him money) and started getting rather aggressive before an American friend intervened. Needless to say I didn't feel comfortable walking around the area and you shouldn't have to feel like that when on holiday. On the bright side, it is only a 10 minute walk into the centre of the city and there are plenty of taxi's available if you want to go further afield.  At this point I would have said that the hotel was decent-good with a poor location, but then something happened 6 months after my stay which completely changed my view. I had booked the hotel through a travel agent, so the hotel had no need to charge me for anything. They did, however, take a credit card number as standard, in case any damages occurred in the room. Needless to say, there were no damages. However, 6 months later, a transaction appeared on my credit card bill from Best Western for a fairly substantial amout of money. I immediately contacted Best Western and my card company about this. The card company said they would investigate the issue while Best Western didn't even apologise or offer any explanation. I never found out what exactly happened but an advisor from the card company said that it looked like an employee of Best Western had obviously kept my card details (when they should have destroyed them after I checked out) and tried to use them 6 months later, and somehow hoped that I wouldn't notice. I realise that this might have been a mistake but the fact that it was 6 months after my details should have been destroyed, means that it is very unlikely an error occured. So, in summary, I would recommend staying somewhere else because not only do I not trust the staff but the area is not exactly glamorous. ',POOR,
'Good Hotel.       Refurbished Room ',GOOD,
'Funk before basics Despite what a lot of customer reviews say, the neighborhood is not the problem with this wannabe boutique-hotel. The real problem is that they nickel-and-dime you for everything. There is also no air conditioning. I would think that if you're going to give a hotel a huge makeover, the first thing you would do is install air conditioning. They didn't here; they were more concerned with putting board game pieces in fat red frames.The hotel wasn't bad, but when we checked into the room, it was terribly hot. The ceiling fan was wired to the track lighting over the bed, so we could only have air if we turned on the lights. I went to the desk to complain about this and they sent up a man who disconnected the lights.There was no refrigerator in the room. We had some leftover takeout, so we asked if we could use one. They sent a man up with a small fridge, but it cost $10 a night. Not bad--but again, a nickel here, a dime there.The lobby and rooms were cute, with brightly-colored plastic retro furniture. If you want to get a good idea of the decor, watch the episode of The Odd Couple when Felix tries to redecorate the apartment. The only thing missing was the chair shaped like a hand. But once you're past the lobby into the halls, the place is a bit creepy. The rooms' floor-to-ceiling windows face the hall/balcony, so there's no privacy. Some people were sitting in dark rooms with their doors open. Others were lying in bed watching TV with their doors and curtains open. Maybe they were trying to cool off. Perhaps there was just an odd collection of people during my stay, but there was constant noise. People yelled down the hall to each other and ran up and down the halls all hours of the night.When we checked out, we found we had been charged $100 for parking a Buick. We never had a car. (Parking is $20 a night.) They reversed this charge, but weren't particularly nice about it, considering it was such a blatant error.Overall, it wasn't terrible. The location is two blocks from Civic Center, BART, and the F streetcar to the Embarcadero. The street is no less safe than Market St. itself.Just don't visit during a hot weather spell! ',POOR,
'Excellent, modern hotel I spent five nights in San Francisco with my girlfriend in September, and we spent two of those nights at The Americania, which is situated on 7th street, approximately a 10 minute walk from Union Square.The hotel has been recently refurbished, in a 'chic', modern style. The rooms were clean, beds were huge and comfortable, and the bathrooms immaculate. Highly recommended at a reasonable price - The Americania has to be some of the best value in the city.Lack of working aircon was noted, but SF was a bit chilly when we visited, so it didn't affect us! ',GOOD,
'Nice hotel Very nice rooms and a friendly staff. Location is not that good, i rather stayed closer to Fishermans Wharf. Parking is 20$ a day (expensive i think) and just around the corner is a large parking which costs 10$ a day. ',POOR,
'Avoid this hotel! This hotel is very noisy and in a terrible part of town. Homeless people, threatening looking people, and various other sorts of seedy people are everywhere. If you want to be near the adult superstore and nightclubs, then this is the place for you.Noise is abundant at all times what with people coming and going at all hours. Around 5am there is a garbage truck or something that comes by and makes a bunch of nose heard on almost every floor and every room. By 5:30am people are checking out or there are other hallway type noises to wake you up. You are extremely unlucky if you get a room next to 7th street - you'll hear every car drive by!Rooms have zero noise insulation so you hear everything. No air conditioning unit, only a fan. Makes for a hot night - and not in a good way!Bathroom wasn't too great. About what I'd expect from a Comfort Inn class. Bed was surprisingly comfortable although the room had a very strange decor.Overall, I would not stay here again and do not recommend you do either unless you are either saving some serious money or insist on being surrounded by noise and vagrants. ',POOR,
'Our trip of the year Being hot as it was , there was no air conditioning in our room. We had a fan in the living room, but nothing for the bedroom. We were unable to have a good nite sleep in 7 days. ',POOR,
'Very modern, fun decor Our family stayed here on a 2-day trip to San Francisco. On the plus side: the hotel is being painted (pink exterior is being painted white), the room was clean and newly renovated (black-and-white ultramodern with a red amoeba-shaped coffee table), the pool was clean, and the valet service (they must park your car for you but it is free) is polite and prompt. The downside: the hotel is in a somewhat seedy part of town (we walked the streets trying to find a more reasonably priced restaurant for breakfast than the one attached to the hotel and were accosted by aggressive panhandlers). We could not find any suitable restaurant nearby other than a Subway sandwich shop and ended up eating breakfast in the hotel's restaurant anyway. The restaurant could use a facelift but the food was decent even if overpriced ($10 for bacon and eggs). Bring some earplugs (loud fire-engine noise) and your own breakfast if you can and enjoy this comparatively well-priced hotel and its peaceful swimming pool. ',POOR,
'Location isn't so great but the Americania is fine! My son and I stayed here for 3 nights on the second leg of our first ever overseas holiday after spending 4 nights in LA and driving all the way to SF.I had read a few reviews on this site and was a little dubious about the pink facade amongst other things. However, as it turns out, this is a terrific place and we really enjoyed our time here.As of April, 2008, the building is no longer pink and is currently being renovated. The rooms were comfortable although not overly spacious and were clean. They were also equipped with coffee making facilities, free internet access and a hairdryer and ironing board.If you are looking to stay in a 'swank' area of SF to stay, then this place is not for you, (plenty of homeless around - but that's the USA for you anyway),) and you would need to move closer into the heart of the city. But all that comes at a price of course.The hotel has a swimming pool, Laundromat, burger joint and bar. The staff were friendly and helpful and it is easy to walk a couple of blocks to Market St and catch the bus/tram/thing (whatever it is) to Fisherman's Wharf. A couple of blocks east puts you in a very nice area of the city as well.We really had a great time at the Americania and I would use this place again if I ever get the chance to visit the USA on another occasion. ',GOOD,
'Excellent for the price Stayed here on our final night of a Trek America trip and were slightly worried after reading some of the reviews. However the hotel itself was excellent. They seem to be renovating the rooms and ours was very clean and modern. The food in the burger bar was EXCELLENT and the whole place was very clean. The area was not great, but like others have said there are street people all over San Fran and unless you want to pay to stay right in the Wharf/Pier area you are going to get some shady characters about. Having said that, we had absolutely no problems with anyone and one bloke even told us the best way to get to Pier 39 and gave us a heads up that we'd need exact change for the cable cars!Hotel staff were extremely helpful...we had LOADS of questions and they were very patient! Rooms were very comfortable, but the only compaint we had was that with them all being set round a courtyard it was quite noisy when other guests were coming in and out. Quite a way from the airport, but the reception staff are more than happy to sort out a taxi/shuttle which we used and paid about $16 each...拢8 for at least 20 mins to the airport didnt seem to bad! Overall a good hotel and for the price we paid we definitely couldnt complain! ',GOOD,
'"Pleasantly Surprised"       Kids in the pool. ',GOOD,
'Exceeds Expectations The Best Western Americania did many things well, considering the price. The hotel has a nice lounge, retreat, and lobby. The hotel even had a fully functional restaurant called 鈥淐ustom Burger鈥? Don鈥檛 let the name fool you, for the money, the meals are outstanding, and if you listen carefully, you might be able to hear Jay-Z on the radio in the background.As for the room, it had many amenities you would expect: Ironing board, Iron, plenty of towels, TV with free cable and WiFi. The beds were serviceable, the linen clean. For that matter, the room was clean throughout. The bathroom and shower showed very little signs of wear. The carpet appeared clean, the furniture, if sparse, was clean. The water pressure was great, with hotel water only seconds away.The only negative I could say about the hotel is the noise level. It seemed like the walls were paper thin. Sirens and car horns could be heard clearly in the room. Other hotel doors opening and closing could be heard, and the worst part was when someone walked down the stairs (nearby to my room) or across the walkway in the floors above, it was like someone beating on a large bass drum. I am, however, a light sleeper, so others might not have these issues.In summary, the room was clean, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the price was fair. The location is convenient for downtown excursions (located only a short walk to the BART Civic Center stop and to the Market Street Cable Car stop) albeit in an area frequented by panhandlers, shady characters, and homeless.

'Fabulous Budget hotel I booked a total of 5 rooms for our eclectic group coming into town for the Folsom Street Fair for 4 nights. We were a mixed group of couples and singles, all in our 40's - 50's. I booked this hotel due to the close proximity of the street fair and the reasonable rates. I had originally booked 1 family room, 2 doubles, a king and a queen room, but upon arrival the lovely day Manager Amy had upgraded 1 of our double rooms, and the queen room to 2 family rooms ( They are a bit bigger ) . I had called a few weeks prior and requested to be put on a waiting list for additional family rooms and this was taken care of for me. The rooms were spotless and well laid out. Granted there is no air conditioning but the cool September nights made the rooms comfortable for sleeping. Paying for parking was no big deal at $15 a night. Coming from NYC we are used to paying much more. The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing around the city, whether driving or taking public transportation. The hotel has a newly renovated resturaunt and bar. Our group took over the bar on a few nights and the bartender Paul was wonderful. The resturaunt was ok for breakfast, a little pricey but the food was fresh and hot. The hotel pool was maintained well and several of our group made us of it. All our rooms were on the 3rd floor overlooking the courtyard and we never had any problems with noise as suggested in some other reviews. The hotel that weekend was booked solid with the Folsom Fair crowd ( look it up ) and the ADA convention, certainly an interesting mix of travelors, but everyone was respectful and pleasant. We also had absolutely no problems with  street people as suggested in other reviews. No different than any other city. And certainly no dangers. The hotel staff went the extra mile for us , from housekeeping to management. A big shout out to Amy for her infecticous smile and the  bubbly and to Iian, the night Mgr for his pleasant and wonderful ways, and to all the housekeepers that took such good care of our rooms . Tipping your housekeeper is something every travelor should do. Just lets them know how grateful we are. This was by far the best 2 star budget hotel any of us had ever stayed in. It was clean and well lit. The staff was wonderful. The hotel had everything we needed and hoped for. If you are looking for a 4 star hotel, then I suggest you book that $400 a night room somewhere else. We will stay here again for all our SF travel. ',GOOD,
'Decent place to stay for the price Two of my girlfriends and I stayed at the Americania from September 14-19th. It was the most reasonably priced hotel that we could find. At the time of booking, parking was said to be free. That policy changed, before we checked in, but the guy at the desk was very passive, and waived the fee for us. The location of the hotel is VERY close to public transportation (which was clean, convenient and safe). The first day took a little adjusting to the transient people wandering around, but then I realized that my church is located in a similar area...so no big deal. They really didn't bother us at all. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Our room was a bit noisy because of the courtyard configuration (and the fact that each door bangs shut and echos through the courtyard), but it wasn't a deal breaker. The pool area was nice, but the saunas were out of service (and looked a little sketchy). There were a lot of foreign tour groups coming through the hotel - one group that met in the courtyard at 7AM to have a debriefing, which was annoying. ',POOR,
'Exactly what was represented The newest reviews of this place have been scary and yes, I admit that the area that it is located in, seems a little sketchy but, if you look closely around all of San Fran, there are street people everywhere. So, if you are squeamish, then try to find somewhere else to stay. Otherwise, the hotel was exactly what was represented. While we tried to reserve a NON smoking room, we were told that it would not be guaranteed. And of course, when we arrived it was not available but, luckily, the rooms are well maintained and did not smell. We stayed in a Family suite (apparently, there are only a few of them) on the fourth floor, which was two double beds/tv in one room and another double/tv in a room that was closed off by a door. The room was tidy and clean and the bathroom was nice and newer looking. The room was cleaned every day and fully restocked. The only problem was the noise level and lack of air circulation. There was one ceiling fan in the main room but not in the second room. When you opened the window in that room you were subject to the noises of the street at night and if you closed it, you were warm and stuffy. Two large washing/drying machines on the main floor make mid-vacation laundry possible. Also, most hotels today serve breakfast as included which makes family travelling easier. This hotel did not. The morning hot buffet was $10 and the cold was $7. Not hugely expensive, but something that they probably could consider including as a Family Friendly thing to do . Finding breakfast outside was not easy as the hotel does sit on a street off the main drag and a little bit away from the better area of town however, it is do-able if you can walk a bit. The local transit is easily within two blocks so, if you can, park the car. However, that will mean an additional $15 per day and valet only as parking is limited. The only other comment was that the staff was found to be a little snooty and not very well informed. When asked for a family style restaurant such as Denny's, staff proceeded to tell us where the local Denny's was. OK, how about a restaurant like TGIF? We were then told where the TGIF was......I think they need a little bit more creative thinking at the front desk or a printed list for reference when questions are asked. We found that the stay in this hotel, as a whole, was ok. Certainly, we had stayed in much more cramped conditions and not as clean. ',POOR,
'Hotel bought out, changed for the worse I previously wrote a review of the Best Western Americania, and since then, have stayed at this hotel several more times with my family. Our last stay was in June and I have to revise my review based on the recent changes.The lady who was working explained that they were just bought out by another company. Usually, when this happens, the new management makes changes for the better, but in this case it is clear that their changes are cost saving measures.The significant changes:1. The complimentary hourly shuttle that used to run from the hotel to and from Union Square is no longer in service. (This was probably the best reason to stay...it was convenient to get to Union Square without paying the high price of staying at a hotel right in Union Square.)2. The advertised free internet wireless throughout the hotel doesn't work unless you sit right in the lobby across from the front desk.The positive aspect of this hotel is that the rooms are fairly spacious, clean and well kept. Although parking is $15/day, it is valet and very convenient. Other things to keep in mind: As other guests have noted, it is in a somewhat shady area of town. It's not dangerous during the daytime, but it's common to see the homeless walk by the hotel. Continental breakfast is available but not complimentary, and there are very limited dining options in the immediate area (the hotel restaurant is closed indefinitely for renovation). The walls are very thin and you can hear through the walls easily. (On our second to last stay, we were rudely awakened by the loud noises of a couple doing the nasty 3 different times at all hours of the night. We called the front desk to complain and they never did anything. This made the hotel seem even more trashy.) Hopefully, the new management will restore some of the perks such as the free shuttle to Union Square, but in the meantime, our family will be looking for another place to stay in SF. ',POOR,
'not pleasant Stayed here for 3 nights. One of the selling points for this hotel was that it offered free parking, therefore you can imagine my surprise when they tried to charge $15 a day, however, this fee was waived. Think we had the worst room in the hotel, as all you could hear was staff going past with trolleys all day and night. Rooms were okay, standard hotel room. The hotel is situated in a really bad area and we were frequently asked for money. Lot's of people sleeping rough in the area and so many people with mental health difficulties. Felt quite unsafe at times especially as we had children with us. Would avoid this hotel at all costs. ',POOR,
'Scary location, comfortable hotel... The hotel itself is a bright pink color, which should clue any passerby into the fact that this Best Western isn't exactly the lap of luxury (the d茅cor is equally as weird and goofy inside). Overall, it was a comfortable stay. Our family had one large two-room unit for 3 nights and we found the room to be both clean and comfortable. The maids did a good job of bringing our room to tip-top shape each day. The employees behind the desk were fine, with the exception of one rude incident. Parking is done via valet and waiting for your car key can be a rather lengthy experience (even though your car is only several feet away from you). Obviously you must factor in the parking fee of $15 a day and any tips you might choose to give. No breakfast is included with the room fee. Windows to the rooms seemed to be a quarter of an inch thick and did NOT feel safe. The neighborhood is quite frightening with graffiti and possible prostitutes just on the other side of the hotel (DO NOT WALK THE AREA AT NIGHT). The hotel isn't too far from the San Fran sights, through it is tough to get back to the hotel thanks to its location among a bunch of one-way streets. There was a strange occupation fee of $20 each night (on top of tax) included in our final bill that we still don't understand. It was a decent stay with some uncomfortable issues. ',POOR,
'Bad hotel in bad area Very disappointed with our stay in this hotel. Cannot believe this hotel is part of the Best Western chain.Price we paid was 150 dollars per night mid-week (breakfast was not even included for this price!).Security was non-existent - any one could walk in off the street. We kept our door locked at all times! The area was seedy.Inside of our bedroom was dirty and needed to be refurbished.Please stay somewhere else when you are in San Francisco. ',POOR,
'OK hotel, pleasant stay. We stayed in the Americania early May 2007 for 5 nights. The room was adequate with TV and coffee making facilities and a nice big bed. The bathroom was small but again adequate. There was also free internet which was handy. The breakfast was reasonable and the price OK. We couldn鈥檛 try the bar as it was closed for refurbishment. Although not in the best area of San Francisco this 'Motel style' hotel had and outdoor heated pool, sauna, and car parking included in the room rate with plenty of spaces which was definitely a plus point. The hotel provided a shuttle bus to and from Union Square but we braved the walk and it was fine although I wouldn鈥檛 fancy walking on my own. We used this hotel as a base for our sightseeing so we weren鈥檛 after an expensive luxury hotel just somewhere to stay the night which is what we got. For the price it was great and we would use this hotel again. ',POOR,
'Smashing Glass My gut reaction to hearing windows being smashed is to have a peek down the hall, but as I reached to pull back the curtain I hear another concerned guest being instructed by a voice in the hallway get back in your room and shut the door. I decided now was not the time to let my curiosity get the better of me and left the curtqin drawn. It's 2am, so I called down to the front desk. Apparently they are already aware there has been a robbery and tell me it's all ok now, the cops are here. Great, I feel better already. The commotion dies down quickly and I call back down with a few questions. The desk informs me the incident was a drug thing, the perpetrator had climbed the building, broke into a room by smashing the floor to ceiling glass window (which all the rooms here have). And I thought the all-night party our first night here was hard to sleep through (when you don't smoke pot yourself, the smell can be a pungent annoyance). If you're coming through San Francisco, stay somewhere else! ',POOR,
'It's not great... but it is cheap. And clean, quiet and safe. Stayed here a year ago, as part of attending a conference. Was it an exceptional hotel? No, it was not. But it was a cheap hotel. And it was clean, quiet and safe. And for the price, what more should you ask for?It's in a seedy area, so walking late at night is a bit iffy. It's quite rundown looking, both inside and out. Internet is provided, as is free parking.I'll be in SF for another conference in a month, and I will be returning to this hotel - which tells you a bit about how I feel about this place. ',POOR,
'Overpriced, neighbourhood with tramps/bums at night Overpriced hotel situated in neighbourhood where bums/tramps come out at night.Hotel is old + tired. It needs to be redecorated. For example, our bed was broken it was so old. They did let us change rooms.Parking is no longer free. 9 percent service charge is now added to breakfast price.BW Carriage Inn + BW Flamingo Inn are across street. Same management. ',POOR,
'Wonderful Suprise I didn't know what to expect after reading all the previous reviews. I was very pleased with my stay. I have stayed at some 60 different hotels in San Francisco, The Best Western Americana is a very good hotel for the price and location.Day #1 I was solo, my room was very clean and quiet. The hotel staff was very helpfull. The next day I had a medical appointment, the hotel has facilties for storering luggage at no charge. Day #2 I was joined by my family. Our Family Room was just as nice. I was disappointed that breakfast was not included in the room price, however the breakfasts that were provided (continental @ $7.95 and Full @ $9.95) were excellent. I had conversations with with people from all over the world. I even met an aquaintance from Holland and had a fun day with them.Parking was FREE. a nice change from the, up to $40 per night at other SF Hotels.This is a 2star hotel, don't expect 4star service. If you want to be pampered in a 4star manor go to a 4star hotel. A great place for the price, considering SF prices.I found that the homeless in this are were few and respectful toward tourists. Yeah they're homeless, and being that way is a tough situation! If you're afraid of them you should stay at hotels near the airport or out of downtown, and take bart or Muni in each day to enjoy the city. ',GOOD,
'No more free parking Beware. Parking used to be free here (as previous comment authors noted.) NO MORE FREE PARKING. Staring Aperil 2007, parking is now $15/day. And they wouldn't even budge when I told them they advertised free parking as recently as last month when I made the reservation. Sorry, it's a new policy, said the manager. From $0 to $15 in one fell swoop??? No longer a great deal. I was planning on staying here again in August, but now will look elsewhere. ',POOR,
'What a wonderful jewel! This motel was a great surprise! I used to live in SF and, although I knew there had been a lot of recent upgrades to the neighborhood, I wasn't expecting much. Can't miss the motel - bold pink! The motel has a series of lovely courtyards, a pool, an exercise room, and (most important in SF) - FREE PARKING! The staff were very pleasant and made me feel safe and welcome. Parts of the neighborhood are still a bit raw but the location is fabulous. Two blocks to Market Street where you can board the city's great bus service or BART (Subway). You can walk to Union Square, Cable cars, Theatre District, High end shopping malls, Wholesale Design and and Flower Mart. These are all within a 10 minute easy walk. Chinatown, North Beach, MOMA, Ferry Building, Moscone Center are less then 20 minutes walk. I loved this place so much I kept the card for any other overnite plans to SF ',GOOD,
'A Great Time This past week, March 3rd, 4 girlfriends and I spent 3 nights at the Best Western Americiana. I had never been to California, so this beind my first experience I was excited about the whole experience. I loved the hotel! It was small, which was nice. That way the people at the front desk knew the peole that were staying there and were able to keep out those that were not. Ian, front desk atttendant, was the BEST! On our last night of our stay, we came back from our night out to find our favorite drinks waiting for us. He even had a lime in my Corona for me, what a sweetie. He told us that it was people like us that made his job fun. The hotel itself was quite unique. It had open air areas that allowed you to sit outside, yet be in your hotel.. The only thing bad about that was if someone wanted to sit outside late at night, you would have to listen to their converstation all night, That happened to us. But a quick phone call to the front desk and the problem was taken care of. I would love to go back to California, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Best Wester Americican again. Once again, Thanks Ian, you are the best!!! ',POOR,
'Great home base for touring! We stayed here for four nights in a family suite (two couples and one 3-year-old). As you entered, a room with queen bed, small sofa bed w/tv, separated by a pocket door, bathroom area, then another pocket door and room with queen bed w/tv with an exterior door. Nice interior courtyard. Very comfortable beds, free parking both garage and outside parking lot (tight, but manageable), refrigerator, and coin operated laundry for guests, heated pool and restaurant. Nice interior courtyard. Awesome natural foods grocery/restaurant (...Urban...market) within a block or two. Neighborhood was ok. Staff was wonderful and helpful with directions and suggestions. We easily went all over San Francisco touring, as well as side trips to Sacramento, San Jose, and Monterey, returning to our room there. We didn't take advantage of the free shuttle to and from Union Square, from which you can go anywhere in the city, but thought it was a great perk. Our son lives a short distance away. Highly recommend this hotel and we will return. ',GOOD,
'Good Value - Seedy Area This hotel is good value and offers enough for the traveller. Downside is that you are near to where all the homeless people hang out and it can be a little intimidating although no-one bothered us during the week we stayed here. The good side is that you can walk almost everywhere in San Fran so it is only say a brisk 15 minute walk to Union Square/China Town and a little further to Fishermans Wharf. ',POOR,
'Stay here often; always a pleasant experience I stay at the Americania several times a year when I'm in SF on business. The free parking, the free shuttle, and the great staff make it a great experience. I like the rooms and open courtyards, as well as the international clientele. Occasionally I have received a room with an older bed, but a quick call to the front desk got me a better room right away. As a woman, the neighborhood is a little frightening to me at night, but there are a couple of convenience stores and good Asian restaurants less than a block away, and I've never had any problems. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel if you use the shuttle We found this hotel great. It has a very quirky design - which was nice. We were not intially impressed with the area as it is run down, we did not really go out much by night.The shuttle service is fab - every 15 minutes I think. Without this the hotel would be quite far out, but the shuttle is free, clean and very prompt. There is a roof top swimming pool which was a very nice feature and surprisingly quiet. The restaurant was very nice - decent price for very nice food. The staff were very helpful too.All in all we had a fab stay at this hotel and I would recommend it. If you want all the action and don't mind paying a bit extra then stay on Fishermans Wharf , but the Best Western was very pleasant for the money. ',GOOD,
'OK once we changed rooms The first room we had was on the end of the building, right on the street and close to the elevator. Not a good combination! The street noise was terrible and the elevator trafffic was also very loud. Once we changed rooms to a different location, the stay got much better. The rooms were a nice size and I liked the courtyard type setup. While the hotel itself felt safe, not a good idea to walk to the cable car lines. To get there you have to walk down one of the worst streets I have walked.The shuttle bus is definately worth the wait.Overall I thought the value was pretty good, and would stay there again. ',POOR,
'Dont Worry Its Fine The room was clean and well equipted. I read reviews about the area, just wanted to elaborate. This location is very close to bart and street cars, buses and taxis. the area is sort of scary....but i sort of liked it. never felt fear even very late at night. the staff was great,the parking was free... use the pool...use the free shuttle to union square... observe a unique blend of americana... would stay again ',GOOD,
'Very tiny room I orginally booked another hotel through Expedia, but a week before departure, Expedia called and told me that they could not place me into the hotel I booked but instead offered Best Western Americania as an alternative. As I'm coming to SF for a convention and all other hotels are booked, I had no choice but to accept. Upon arrival, I was checked into one of the smallest room on the premises. Although the room was clean, the bed was old and sagging. The neighborhood is also not the best. On the walk to the Moscone center, there is one block where there are many homeless sleeping on the street; people walking around asking for money; although I was not met with any instances, it was all together not a comforting experience. I would not recommend this hotel to business travelers who are planning on walking to the Moscone Center. I think this hotel is really a 2 stars, at most 2 1/2 stars hotel. ',POOR,
'Good location and value I have stayed at the Americania twice on business trips, and it's perfect when you need a reasonably priced hotel near downtown San Francisco. The free parking makes it an extra good value. (I went to a meeting the next day at the Omni in San Francisco, where parking alone would have cost 1/3 the price of my room at the Americania.) It's a very handy location for coming from SFO airport (just take 280 to 6th St and you're there). The neighborhood is a bit run down, but not dangerously or disturbingly so. The staff is friendly. The outdoor courtyards and open-air halls connecting the rooms are odd but fine. My rooms have been clean with comfortable beds. I did find a worker rebuilding the shower in the first room I was given, but the staff apologized and gave me an an upgraded room to make up for the inconvenience. I'm sure I'll stay here again. ',GOOD,
'very convenient and a great value We just spent 2 nights at the hotel and were extremely happy with it. Although the location is a little away from the beaten track- the shuttle into Union Sqaure was great. One morning we walked 2 blocks to Market street and could take any of a number of buses and streetcars to anywhere. The staff was extremely helpful and efficient. The free valet parking and free interent were real pluses for us. Because there is no air conditioning- it can be a little noisy when the windows are open. The rooms were immaculate and very nicely decorated. I would definitely come back here the next time I am in San Francisco. I consider this one of the bet values in the city. ',GOOD,
'This hotel is designed to hear every guest's noise! We just returned from a trip to our favorite city, San Francisco. In choosing a hotel, I required it to be within walking distance to the warf, have free parking, a weight room and a pool. This hotel had all of those things, and the pictures posted on the web site were true to reality. What we could not tell from photos is what kept us from sleeping every night!! The hotel is designed to have an interior courtyard, so that every room faces outside into this open space. In summer when (with no air conditioning) all windows are open, everyone coming home from bars or arriving from a late flight was approximately 2 inches from the bed beside the window. It happened to be freakishly hot during our stay, but the air temp. cooled at night to ~70. The way the building was framed, there was no airflow into the room unless we had the door wide open, which many guests did during their stay that week. This brought up the level of noise too. We will never stay at this hotel again, but will return to the city as much as we can! ',POOR,
'Great hotel scary neighbourhood When we drove to our hoel we were a little bit worried by all the homeless people that were on the streets but once we got to our hotel it was fine. There was free parking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The elevator had a key lock so you had to be a guest to get in the building. The front desk staff were very helpful! The rooms were clean and big. I only wish there was a fridge and microwave. There was defintely the space for it! I will stay here again the next time I come to San Francisco the shuttle to and from Union Square was wonderful!!!!!!!!!! ',GOOD,
'Decent enough My husband and I with our two kids under 3 years old stayed one night there while in town for a convention at the Moscone Center. I was a bit leary after reading some of the reviews, and almost canceled reservation. Then when we got there I felt a lot better. They had Valet Parking which was nice, and a pleasant and helpful staff. The Pizza place had very good pizza and delivered to the room. Also, the restaurant had great food which you could get to go. The family room which we had was on the second floor and was clean. Room was great for our two year old, she had plenty of room to move around. Although no microwave it had a fridge. It has a nice open courtyard which you can sit out in and get some fresh air. Although the neighborhood is not the greatest at night, your in S.F what can you expect. During the day it did not seem bad. All around I would stay there again. ',POOR,
'Just awful The hotel was placed in the worst possible area of Sanfrancisco. Homeless people and gangs everywhere, I felt quite threatened.The room had no hot water. We complained about it several times but unfortunately was never fixed.it was incredibly noisy. People were coming into the hotel at 3am after partying. We reported this to the front desk, and they didn't care about it.I had no sleep, no shower. We were paid for three nights, but left after the second, exhausted and desperate for a shower. Would never stay there again and certainly would not recommend the hotel. ',POOR,
'Disappointing Best Western Having stayed at a lovely BW in Niagara a couple of years ago, we felt we could trust any of the hotels in this chain, and so had no worries about booking the Americania. However, we were more than disappointed when we arrived. Although we arrived late in the hours of darkness, we sensed that its location was not ideal (on a rough-looking side street off one of the major thoroughfares of the city). Seeing it in daylight didn't improve our judgement. The reception area was nice enough, the staff pleasant, the restaurant small but not bad. It was finding our way to the room which mostly horrified us. We had not stayed in a motel-style accommodation before so it was a shock to find that we were in the open air when tracking it down. We'd been used to going down hallways with a carpet and ceilings! The room was small but usable, but nothing like we had expected to find. I wouldn't stay here again, with the factors of the street location and the open air access to the rooms being most offputting.If you're used to motels, you may not find it at all bad but we didn't like it. Maybe the other 2 BW's across the street were better. ',POOR,
'Great value hotel - odd location The Best Western Americania is a well-maintained hotel near the major tourist attractions in San Francisco. Decent, clean rooms. Well-informed and really helpful staff. Free parking (not very common in SF!!) in the hotel garage! Small but nice heated pool on the second floor.As for the location - I must say it I didn't bother, but my girlfriend didn't feel all too secure as there were many drug addicts  beggars in the area (esp. on and around Market St.). I guess that comes with the free and open-minded spirit of San Francisco (poor pals!!).My personal bottom line: Recommended hotel! ',GOOD,
'Great Location, Great Shuttle, Great City! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Best Western Americania for four nights in the middle of January 2006. The room was excellent. The free internet was a bonus as well.The location was great with only a short walk to Union Square from the hotel (5-10 mins). But the shuttle ran you in there anyways, so the walk wasn't overly necessary.The amount of homeless is not that bad. They do not worry you at all and if you ignore them, there is no problem.The only downside was the rudeness of the staff in the restaurant. Whilst a few of them were helpful, the manager was not helpful and was quite blunt at times.Would wholeheartedly recommend the hotel to anyone going to San Fran. (Just skip the restaurant). ',GOOD,
'Not worth any budget We stayed at this hotel with our 4 boys for a week last summer. The parking is aweful. If you don't mind keeping your shoes on the whole time then this hotel is for you. It is very dirty and is in a very bad part of town. ',POOR,
'Great value Americana! This is a very good hotel and excellent value for money. We were worried by the reviews about the area (we are parents with 2 children under 4), but in fact I went out several times after dark and felt safer than most capital cities I have visited. Staff were great and the rooms were of a high standard. Being out of the city is no problem as the shttle bus each hour is magic, right to union square.Soma pizza is good value accross the road, and provided a highlight of the holiday in a middle aged, beared man who rode up on a push bike and orded a slice of pizza - top to toe in a lovely (if a bit mucky) wedding dress.Also, try Tony Baloneys for lunch on the corner - great sandwiches.A great stay in a good value hotel. Will stay there again! ',GOOD,
'Dirty Best Western Americana! So...at first I thought this was a slightly shabby, but decent hotel.Then my father jumped out of his bed to kill a bug that had crawled across the pages of his book. After further investigation we found red bedbugs in both of the queen beds in the suite! But that wasn't it, after that I went to grab my clothes off the dresser only to watch as a roach scurried along the corner of the dresser to hide under my clothes! Truly a nightmare...and the manager pretended to call another hotel for us (also a Best Western in Santa Rosa). However, when we arrived there, the woman manning the desk said she hadn't received any phone calls to say that we were on our way. ',POOR,
'It's a good value motel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during last year X-mas week. It's really a motel as structure, layout and comfort level, but there's nothing to complain about. We took a family room that was spacious and clean. The decor was horribly tasteless but what do you expect in a motel and does this matter so much. The rooms are situated on an exterior corridor, though there was not much noise and disturbance. The staff is helpful, the rate excellent. The clientele was mostly caucasian with many Europeans.There are 3 big things that make this place recommendable: free parking (a rarity in CA),free wireless internet and the motel shuttle to downtown.Although the motel is at a 10-min walking distance, you must be advised that ANY place except Union square in San Francisco feels unsafe for a night walk. The square is laced by numbers of homeless riff raff punks, who cluster at dusk for their rowdy drinking and may become agressive and gang-like. They outnumber the patrolling policemen almost 20:1 and it's a pity and a shame to see the majestic Frenchy-looking civic center surrounded since 8pm by a crowd that seems ready to storm the Bastille. This city badly needs its Giuliani, but that's another story. The point is that the h(m)otel shuttle can save you from all that and from driving under 2-3 beers or glasses of wine, and is free(complimentary in motel's lingo).Other than that there's nothing to do in the area (San Francisco is overrated anyway)and you may be stuck with the motel's so-so restaurant, enjoying their free HBO and ah! the free wireless internet! ',GOOD,
'Good hotel..... Nice, clean room. I choose this place for the free parking. I would stay again if I got a good deal. Far away from the action so I would only stay here if you had a car. Got an upgrade one stay and had a very nice room but don't know if that would happen at a busy time. Front desk staff was nice. Not much food in the area. ',POOR,
'Look elsewhere There are two major problems with this hotel. the first is location - its in a pretty ugly part of town with not much around by way of choice of resturants. It is somewhat saved in this respect by the very convenient shuttle bus to Union Square. However, next time I will choose to stay closer to Union Square. The second problem - the noise factor. The hotel is built in several levels around a few narrow courtyards, and the front of the room has large windows, one of which consists of glass louvres which cannot be closed completely. Apart from the security aspect (and while I was in reception heard one guest complaining about missing CD's and the receptionist commenting on the ease of entry to the room through the louvres), this also results in the inability to shut out the noise caused by the acoustic problem of the design. The walls between rooms are also very thin. The layout of the room was good and the bathroom nicely positioned, but would not stay here again. ',POOR,
'Bad hotel and alot of money dont mix. I mean it was ok for a budget hotel but everything was attracted to money. The breakfast was like 12 buck a person for awful food. The rooms were ok. They were a little nicer than your average hotel. They had textures wall and paintings. the hotel seemed to be a confusing layout though. The pool had a good view and it was warm. I was more of a motel then a hotel witch i didnt like because you had to go outside to get to the lobby. I would not recomend this hotel event to budget travlers becouse of one reson. The loacation a at its worst. I soon found out it was located in the worst possible place in sanfransico. There alot a gangs on the street as well as homeless people. You felt like you were locked in the hotel because of all the gates and security. You felt also like if you were to leave the hotel and go out on the sidewalk you were going to get mugged. It is not a good feeling. The hotel is not at all comforting. There is nothing in the area either meaning you are stuck in the hotel at night. It is not one to stay at. ',POOR,
'Great price, clean, Don't bring your kids We stayed there in late Sept and early October. The price was amazing for San Francisco and there was free parking, too. The hotel itself seemed old but clean and the staff was very helpful. The shuttle ran regularly, and the train stop is really close. The neighborhood was not great, but we are not from a large city and, even for us, it wasn't a bit scary during the day and we felt OK walking the short block to the train station at night in a group of 4. The food was good in the restaurant downstairs, and the free internet worked fine (Bring Cat-5 cable if you want the internet no matter which room you are assigned to; we couldn't get wifi on the 3rd floor and had to hook up.)This hotel was perfectly fine for us...2 couples without the kids spending very little time at the hotel. Most of the problems were nothing the hotel staff had a lot of control over, but there was some interesting stuff going on. The pool appeared very neat and clean, and the 1st night we were there I saw 3 men in it doing things I wouldn't want to have to explain to a child. The same night I saw 2 men entering the sauna, and the were naked BEFORE they went in. I also found clothes and a crack pipe on the treadmill in the workout room. None of the exercise equipment worked, either, but I didn't complain because I wasn't going back in there anyway incase the owner of the crack pipe returned. We did report the crack pipe and they sent a maintenance man to get it. I don't see how the hotel could have prevented the other stuff.Finally, it is an old hotel with a central courtyard and sound really travels in there. It only takes one drunk nut screaming at 2 am to wake up everyone in the place.I know it sounds bad, but I would stay here again. I felt safe in my room and in the elevators, the location is really great if you don't mind using public transportation, and the price is unbelievable for SF. ',POOR,
'Liked this one I stayed for 3 nights Oct. 2nd-5th. After reading the reviews here I expected a much worse neighborhood. OK, I would be careful at night, but we had no problems walking around the area at daylight.The hotel is OK. Nice rooms. They didn't get the internet working in my first room so I got an upgrade to a business room the next day. We didn't have any meals in the hotel, so I can't comment on this one. Pool is very nice, clean and warm. Parking is free as is the shuttle to Union Square, which we used frequently. Friendly drivers, somewhat ragged busses.If I return next time, I'll give it another try. ',GOOD,
'not scared by homeless riff raff stayed there several times with wife and buddies other times. rooms are clean and anchor steam is cheap during happy hour. not the best area of town soma. why would you be walking around there any how at night? several nice places over on folsom, roccos, basil to name a few. been panhandled more in san jose going to and from sharks games. ',POOR,
'OK room, bad neighborhood I agree it's definitely not the nicest neighborhood...the train station is a bit skanky, with homeless people hanging around. I'm originally from New York, so I'm used to seeing that and it didn't bother me as much as it might bother someone from a smaller city. The room itself was OK, on the small side but decently furnished and clean. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. ',POOR,
'Nice room, warm pool We had the family suite. Lots of room, comfortable, clean. Very warm pool which is great even if the weather is cold. Not the best neighborhood, but the hotel felt secure. Easy access to most parts of the city. The restaurant had very good food, but limited breakfast menu. ',POOR,
'Safe, clean and FREE PARKING!!!! There was nothing elaborate about the hotel.(We saved that for the wine country) We needed a safe, clean place to rest at night which didn't charge our car for resting too. The Best Western Americana did the trick. During the day we were sightseeing and didn't spend time at the hotel. The staff was above average in friendliness and helpfulness. The hotel provided a shuttle to Union Square which was timely and never crowded. I must admit that at first I was a little concerned about the area, but felt very safe. I would stay there again if I needed a place for the car and if my intent was to sightsee all day. Tip: Walk/ bike across the Golden Gate Bridge. I was more adventureous and continued walking into Sausilito, then took the ferry back to Fisherman's Wharf. ',POOR,
'Not the best area of town to stay in!!! We stayed here for 3 nights June 18-21st and we were a little worried about the location. Not be best area of town alot of homeless people around...This was our first time to San Francisco and we had a hard time locating the hotel. We booked this hotel mainly for the free parking but with a truck it is a tight squeeze in the underground parking. There is a good pizza place across the street but it was a little greasy!!! The rooms were very clean and there was not to much noise. There is a nice courtyard with a fountain and chairs to sit out in during your down time.If you are looking for a budget hotel with free parking this hotel would be fine. Next time we are going to pay the extra for the parking and stay closer to wharf. ',POOR,
'Ok for the money The hotel is pretty clean and the staff very friendly. The free parking is a plus,though it's pretty tight with a large car or SUV.It's not in the best area, a few blocks north is the tenderloin district which has lots of homeless and can be a bit pesky asking for money. Use the free shuttle to Union Square to avoid them. Shuttle runs at least every hour from early AM to around 11:00pm.Overall I have mixed feelings about this place. If you are on a budget, it's OK.If you got money to burn I would look elsewhere ',POOR,
'Great hotel...don't listen to the bad reviews... This review is a bit overdue...but an excellent hotel, exceptional staff, nice room, also included is a private sauna room to use (you check out the keycard...nice and private). I'm not sure why folks are giving this property negative reviews...have stayed their twice and we just love this property! Highly recommended. Thanks for reading. ',GOOD,
'Not up to expectations... We booked our stay at the Americana in San Fran online... Judging the hotel by the descriptions and pictures we saw, we figured that it looked/sounded like a nice place to spend the night... We're we ever disapointed when we showed up... First of all, I would never accuse this place of even being a HOTEL... It was more of a motor inn... It looked like it was falling apart and everything seemed dirty... In fact, there was a pile of garbage and dirt in front of our room's door... The rooms themselves didn't seem dirty, but they definately aren't $150 rooms... Even for San Francisco... Plus, the area of town the hotel is in is a little bit sketchy... We didn't feel entirely safe and especially worried about our vehicle and it's contents... Plus, there's hardly any parking, so they expect some of the guests to block in other cars, then leave their keys at the front so that staff can move them when needed... No thanks. Despite the disapointment of our overall experience, I will say that the linens and bathrooms seemed clean and we did have a good sleep. Don't trust the pictures on the website though... It's no where near as nice. ',POOR,
'Loved S. F. Clean, well maintained older hotel. Excellent staff and shuttle serviceto union square and city wide transportation. Good restaurant and free parking. Stayed 3 nights week of 3-14-05. Would stay again !Mike from Michigan. ',GOOD,
'Cute Hotel - Terrible Area This hotel was really quite nice. Built around the internal courtyards it had a nice personal feel about it. The staff were great. The sports bar was pretty cool and the free internet lounge was good as well. The rooms were a good size and of a reasonable standard. Now the bad part. The area is appalling. It is a few blocks away from The Tenderloin which is a really bad area in San Francisco and while the hotel is not in the area itself alot of the unsavoury elements spill into the surrounding areas. I definitely felt unsafe at night and would not recommend walking the streets after dark. There are many homeless people and we were accosted nearly everytime we went outside the hotel. On the first night we asked at the front desk if there was somewhere we could go for a quick bite, fast food. We were directed 2 blocks up to market street where there was a hamburger joint. We had homeless people coming into the restaurant and begging at our table. There was a large crowd of people at the front of the restaurant and I stupidly asked the person at the service counter why they were all hanging about and she went red and looked embarrassed and explained that they were 'selling something' (I'm sure you can figure that out for yourself) As I said nice hotel, terrible area. Not a good one for families i would suggest. One good thing though if you do stay here go to SOMA pizza across the road. Great Pizza! ',POOR,
'Excellent value for money A very comfortable and safe place to stay. The security at this hotel is excellent as is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble. The hotel was very deceiving and was larger than first impressions give. What we liked the best was the free courtesy bus running every hour during off peak times and every half hour during peak times from the hotel to Union Square and return. This hotel also offers free internet access so you can spend your evenings doing some homework for your next days activities and keeping in touch with loved ones. Would definately recommend and return if we were ever in the area again. ',GOOD,
'"Alright, but not the Best" Found this Hotel to be what the rating is. The rooms were clean, but the beds were doubles and not very comfortable. Even though the climate at the time was summer, San Francisco was about 20oC when we were there, but the rooms were very hot and they had no cooler, so found it hot to sleep at night. The Peppercorn Resturant was not that great, so go out and eat and not at the pizza place across the road.Only recommend this if you are on a budget. ',POOR,
'Great for what we wanted We stayed here for 5 nights in September. It is on the edge of an area you don't want to walk round in but the shuttle bus is great (thanks to Mac the driver) and taxis are cheap. The rooms are comfortable and clean, we ate in Peppers in the hotel twice and both nights it was very good.We were on our way out one night at about 8:30 and our door refused to lock! We had a dinner reservation and didn't think we'd make it as we couldn't leave the room, but someone came and fixed it really quickly and we weren't even late in the end. So we were impressed with the service.Tony's Baloney round the corner is handy and great for breakfast. I would stay at the hotel again, as lots of nice parts of San Francisco are near not quite so nice parts unless you pay top dollar. ',GOOD,
'Basic value Booked the family suite in August for 3 nights. Be aware that the two beds are doubles (not queens!) and the sofa bed is only for small, light weight children. Bathroom is very small and the sink/counter is part of the room. The location is not the best in town, you are pretty far from most tourist attractions. All said it was not terrible but there are plenty of other hotels in the City that are far better. If you are a family with small children on a budget, this might be okay. ',POOR,
'Stole my Cell Phone We stayed there for 2 nights. So called Family Room is so tiny. As a matter of fact, it is the same size as any other room. Bathtub doesnt drain and nasty. Carpets arent clean either. Other than eye-sore flaming pink painted all over the building, this Best Western Americania has nothing special about it. On top of that, they employ theives to do the house cleaning. I left my cell phone in the room and nobody could find it. Managers said they tear the room down and still couldnt find my phone. God only knows if they bother to do that. I hate to accuse someone for something they arent resposible. But not in this case. I will never stay in this Best Western again. Best Western Americania employ the staff who are dishonest and take no pride in their job. Dont stay there. Period. ',POOR,
'Great Stay Stayed here for 5 nights in September and found the hotel lovely.. We had big room which was clean and had good air conditioning. Free Shuttle bus was great to city Centre even though its only about a 10 minute walk ( not great area to be walking through late at night) Would definately recommend this hotel ',GOOD,
'comfortable... Stayed a few nights after vacationing in Napa Valley...clean, comfortable, and the staff is friendly.I found the location pretty convenient, with the free shuttle service and bus lines. ',GOOD,
'Enjoyable stay!! I stayed at the Americania during my recent visit to San Francisco. The free parking was great. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Their front desk staff was helpful and friendly. I would gladly recommend the Americania to anyone who would ask for a good hotel value in San Francisco. ',GOOD,
'Good value - pleasant stay This was a one night stay before heading north to Sonoma and Napa Valley. Our double room comfortably fit four of us, it was convenient and economically priced and had free parking which is a plus in SFO. Rooms were clean as well as common areas, staff friendly and helpful--- although when we returned around 3 A.M. the front desk clerk was asleep. We walked around the area, infact were out quite late and encountered no problems. There is a lack of good restaurants close by so we had to settle for a little 24 hour burger joint for a late supper. The restaurant in the hotel only serves a buffet or continental breakfast which is below par and way over priced so would recommend avoiding it. ',GOOD,
'Value for Money - Would Stay Again Stayed at the BW Americania for 4 nights at the end of June. We booked a 1 bed room suite, which had 3 double beds in total, for a very reasonable price of $135 + tax per night. We booked directly through the hotel (who will match offers you have seen on the internet but you do not have to pay in advance and can cancel up to 24 hours in advance - which is useful). We had a very positive experience of the hotel and would stay there again, especially for the price. So here's the head's up on the hotel. First the positives, Free parking (plenty of spaces and even when the lot is full the valet will find you a spot for no charge), free local calls, very helpful staff, free shuttle service to Union Sq, short walk to union square if you don't won't to wait for the bus (15 mins, although not recommended at night or if alone). Now the negatives: The area is not the best but is not an issue with the shuttle service and if you have a car. We walked to Union sq some mornings, so it was fine but would not want to do this at night. Rooms feel old (not that bad) and could do with a face lift however beds are comfortable and sheets/towels were clean. Bedrooms which face the street can be quite noisy in the mornings. Also the sink is not separated with a door from the rest of the suite which means you can wake the other people if you get up or sleep at different times. But these negatives are not a major issue and all in all, I think this is a good place to stay in SF. ',POOR,
'Decent hotel, bad neighboorhood Stayed four nights at Americania. The hotel is located in SoMa which is a bad neighboorhood in SF with lots of homeless people. Not much safety feeling after sunset. The first room I got was clean but very very smal and the window can be opened for only 4 inches. The hotel doesn't have ANY air conditioning, only ceiling fans. I asked another room and after I was required to pay more money (I refused) I got another room which was in the atrium and it was very large and spacious. Nice bathroom. In room Cofee and hairdryer. The layout of the hotel is quite strange and the elevators are quite far. The breakfast (not included) was somehow limited and expensive. You cannot just take a sandwich and cofee. You have to take a very greasy food buffet at $12.75 !! Got a decent and cheaper breakfast at a small bistro 100ft from the hotel.The rate (not so cheap) includes free parking which is a good thing as parking in SF is a very expensive thing. Anyway, there is not enough space for all the guests cars. If you you are cheching out very early, do to yourself a good thing and tell this to reception. Otherways, if you have to leave at 5.30am, it will take 30-40 minutes to move all the cars left everywhere which blocked parking access. The hotel has 2 PCs for Internet which are busy all the time.The staff was very friendly but I stayed in line few times for more than 10 minutes as they have to answer and pass the phone calls, arrange trips order and give bell-boy services etc. It's a decent hotel, in a bad neighboorhood with no Air Conditioning in the summer.

'Loved it. Stayed at this hotel before and after a cruise. The room booked by the travel agent was basic but on our return we booked extra days directly with the hotel and were given a fantastic room with a view of the Space Needle at a good budget price. Would definitely stay there again. Staff were very helpful. Lovely complimentary breakfast. Free tea and coffee 24 hours a day. Great location. ',GOOD,
'Ok for the price I see that most people will agree with me, the hotel is ok for the price. The reason I have given 4 instead of 3 points is, that now that I think of it and having returned from a 4 week United States trip, I find this hotel above average for the prize they charge.$99 during high season for two people, including an (average) breakfast, located not far from downtown Seattle - that sounds like a pretty good deal to me.The location is really convenient, it's just a short walk to Space Needle, and from there one can take the air train directly into Seattle.The staff was helpful and friendly; there was complimentary wireless internet available and coffee and tea in the lobby.The rooms seemed mostly clean, but way too small. You'd basically have to crawl over the bed to reach the far side of the room. Also, this hotel has the slowest elevator I have ever seen, but all in all the convenience of the location and prize just beats those small downsides. ',GOOD,
'Nothing fancy, but excellent location My fiance and I chose to stay here because we wanted to be downtown without breaking the bank. The rooms are basic but adequate - especially if you plan to spend the majority of a weekend stay exploring Seattle, as we did. The location is excellent - walking distance to trendy Belltown shops and restaurants. We had a memorable Italian dinner at Barolo Ristorante, a ten minute walk from the hotel. ',POOR,
'Ok for the price Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of August. The location is good if you are visiting the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, monorail) and you are just a short bus ride (stops right out front) into downtown and Pike Place Market.We had one of the larger rooms on the 5th floor. While it was nice to have more space, not sure it was worth the extra money. The carpet was in need of a good cleaning or replaced. I would not walk barefoot on it. The bed was ok. The bathroom looked like it had been updated not long ago. We did find ants in the room on our last night but did not bother to complain since it was getting late and we would be checking out early in the morning. The breakfast was your typical free hotel breakfast, nothing fancy but was very crowded.The pool  hottub were great to have and to pass a couple of hours in the evening since it was raining during our stay.We found the front desk staff to be very helpful and answered all our questions.We didn't have any issues with noise coming from the busy street below but that might be because we were on the top floor.Would we stay here again, maybe if we could get a better price and they did some updating. ',POOR,
'Acceptable (barely) for the price My family of four (including 7  9 year old boys) stayed at this downtown Seattle hotel for two (2) nights before an Alaskan cruise. It was one of the less expensive hotels in the area and I was not expecting luxury, but my overall stay was disappointing. On the good side, it is in a safe area just a few blocks from the Space Needle and surrounding attractions and Pike's Market and the waterfront are walkable (although a little bit of a hike). However, the rooms and lobby are tired (the entire building really), the breakfast area overcrowded and it is serviced by a single, small, slow elevator. The advertised free shuttle to the dock was instead $6.00 per person and contracted out to a van service and the high speed internet was also down. The front desk staff was adequate, but I could have accomplished the same goals for less (with a better breakfast) at the adjoining Travelodge. At best, this is a 1-2 night hotel when waiting to go on a cruise (which about half of the guests were). For that purpose, it's fine. However, if you are visiting Seattle as your destination, I would look elsewhere. ',POOR,
'Just fine I had to make a last minute trip to Seattle while two conventions were going on and this was the closest hotel to the downtown area I could. When you arrive the dingy 70's exterior doesn't do a lot to ease your mind, nor does the location but once you get into your room things improve. It seems to be newly renovated and everything was clean. Bed was quite comfortable and the room was quiet, despite facing a rather busy street. The rooms are quite small but I live in NYC and I'm used to tight quarters so it didn't really bother me. The breakfast room makes your high school cafeteria feel like the Ritz and is a rather depressing start to the day, I'd skip it and talk a walk over to Belltown for a proper cup of coffee and any kind of breakfast you'd want.Totally acceptable for what it is, a motel on the edge of town. ',POOR,
'Convenient location but not much else to recommend The Quality Inn  Suites Seattle has a couple of things going for it -- price and location -- but that's about it.I'm guessing that this hotel opened its doors back in 1962 when Seattle hosted a World's Fair, hoping to capitalize on fairgoers visiting the city back then. There are two or three other similar hotels nearby built to the same blocky college dorm standards as this one. I've seen references on different websites noting that this hotel was recently renovated, but evidence is sadly lacking. This hotel looks tired and could use a spruce-up. The room was a big disappointment -- two queen beds, a knotty pine dresser, a TV, and little else crammed into a tiny space. There wasn't even a chair in the room to sit on. I'm sure there are monk's cells better furnished than the rooms in this place. The room was so small that the three of us would be tripping over each other if we all tried to move at the same time.The rooms either overlook Aurora Ave. (the hotel is not set back from the street) or the back alley and the adjacent Travelodge. Aurora Ave. is a busy major thoroughfare that carries a lot of traffic (and the accompanying noise) into downtown Seattle in the morning rush hours. The rooms in the back don't get the traffic noise, but you have to contend with sound of garbage trucks emptying the dumpsters early in the morning. A lot of construction is currently going on in this neighborhood, including a building across the street from the hotel. That raises the daytime noise level as well.If you have a car, note that while parking is free for guests, you may not be able to get a space in the hotel parking lot. There are not enough spaces in the lot under the hotel to accommodate all guests. At night you can park at the end of the driveway off Aurora Ave., but that may necessitate backing out onto a busy street the next morning. The alternatives are parking on the side streets or in a nearby surface lot that will cost you. Because of the nearby construction some spaces on the street have been designated as no parking areas, limiting that alternative.The indoor pool is OK, though it was closed for one day of our stay. There are no changing rooms at the pool and you have to walk through public areas of the hotel in your bathing suit to get there, so bring a coverup if that's an issue for you.Breakfast is the pastries and bagels fare that you find at most hotels these days. Get there at least a half hour before the breakfast room closes, however, because it doesn't look like they restock the buffet during the final 30-45 minutes.On the plus side, this place is three blocks from Seattle Center attractions like the Experience Music Project, Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle. Busses to downtown Seattle stop at the front door every 10-15 minutes during the day. The front desk people we dealt with were friendly and helpful. The neighborhood seems safe at night and there are restaurants nearby in the Belltown neighborhood (about a 10 minute walk)If you're not fussy or claustrophobic, I suppose you could get by here. If you're willing to spend more money, the much newer Holiday Inn Express on the other side of Aurora Ave. might be a much better choice in this neighborhood. I wish I had done that. ',POOR,
'Awesome A+ Experience!!!! I have been to my share of hotels and this one have surpassed my expectations.No dislikes at all. Hotel experience was amazing. Room was clean and comfortable. Great location at a reasonable rate. Customer service an A+. Look out for Ricky, cause he's the man! He'll get you more than what you need and is extremely friendly. ',GOOD,
'okay for a night or two Good points: The location is great -- a five minute walk to space needle. The continental breakfast is well stocked and is of good quality, the bathrooms are newer. Price is not out of line for downtown Seattle.Down side: Parking is a royal pain, not nearly enough of it. get there after five and good luck finding a space, staff not all that helpful in most regards. OLD hotel, very slow and rickety elevator. While bathrooms are clean and look new, they need to replace room carpets or something, because ours smelled like a gym bag filled with sweaty socks. Hallway smelled old and musty as well. plug in alarm clock in room did not work, had to call twice to ge a replacement, then the replacement(which was older than the original one) did not work either. It was okay for a one night stay before heading to the airport the next morning, and as I said quite close to space needle and tourist spots downtown. ',POOR,
'Some rooms are awfully tiny--smallest I ever had in a Quality Inn or Choice Hote The hotel is clean. The odd numbered backside rooms escape the traffic noise. Near things. But a feeling of long cave-like halls, mild service, and what a bloody small room. Europe? Nope, Seattle. Not a bad deal at Seattle prices, but certainly the Queen rooms are nothing I look forward to again. Fine, but not uplifting. ',POOR,
'Good downtown location This is a great hotel to stay at if you have lots of downtown Seattle activites planned. We spent three nights here and weren't disappointed. The ONLY complaint I have (which really is minor in the scheme of things) is that there is only one computer in the lobby with internet access and it was really difficult to get on it with the hotel being very busy. I think for the size and capacity of this hotel, they should definitely have a second or even a third computer. I also think that travelers who want to spend time on myspace and other sites like that should bring their own computers and have the common courtesy to not monopolize the only computer available for guests. With that being said, the rest of our time here was great.Public transportation has a pick up right in front of the hotel. We opted for this for trips to Pike Place Market, as parking down there would have cost us $15 and the bus cost us $6.50 round trip. We walked to the Space Needle, restaurants, and also walked to the dock of the Victoria Clipper (Pier 69). We found it much easier (mostly beacuse of parking prices), and left our rental car parked in the gated parking lot beneath the hotel. Breakfast was abundant, but the breakfast room was WARM and always full so we did take the food back to our room. The people at the front desk were incredibly friendly and helpful with travel ideas, bus routes, restaurant suggestions, etc. The Mariners were in town and they had sign-up sheets at the front desk for shuttles to the games for $5/person. We had a room that had a sliding glass door to an outdoor area where everyone from the hotel had access to. I wasn't happy the first day back when our curtain had been opened by the housekeeper so everyone could see in and see what we had. The next day the curtain was kept closed which I was thankful for. Our room was always made up and cleaned very well. I did a load of laundry and found it reasonable at $1.50 per machine to wash and dry. ',GOOD,
'okay but needs upgrading My family and I stayed here for 2 nights, we got the big family suite on the fifth floor. Definitely not worth over $260 a night but with 6 people to divide with, it made it ok We heard plenty of comments from people in the elevator ride up that we were LUCKY we weren't on the second floor because the rooms were horrible. Because they were busy we had to move into another suite the second night. The second suite was a little more run down than the first one. They definitely NEED to steam clean the carpets or get new carpet it was pretty gross. I would not walk without shoes in the room. Air conditioning wasn't the greatest but was manageable. Nice size family rooms, but we probably won't go back. Would rather spend a little more money for something nicer and more updated...After all I am on holidays ',POOR,
'Good enough We just needed a basic room to use after a late concert at Key Arena. We checked in around 4:00 and the staff was very friendly. We were very thankful for the free parking as well. The hotel as a whole is older and a bit dingy, but it was good enough for us. Our room was quite small, barely enough room to walk around the two double beds, with a table, chair, and TV crammed into one corner, but since all we needed was a bed and bathroom, we were fine. The bathroom was small too, but clean, and lots of hot water. The air conditioner also cooled the room very well. The free breakfast had a good selection and tasted good. In short, if you need a no-frills hotel close to Seattle Center, and don't want to pay for parking, this is a good place to stay. If you want big and fancy, you won't be impressed. ',POOR,
'Not best choice We stayed one night on the 5th floor. Hard to find - directions not clear. On very busy road, so pretty loud. Elevator really slow and made ominous noises. Lighting on floor dim, sort of creepy. Room layout weird - two sliding glass doors out to tar paper roof - no seating, no signs saying Stay Off. Small kids next door were of course drawn to edge. Could not get DVD player to work and called front desk to ask question - staff didn't know but would send someone up. Canceled request. Not in best area - thought we could walk to Seattle Center but homeless people were sleeping in doorways between the two places - and I have young girls. Opted not to walk. Stuffy smelling. Windows grimey from the inside. Odd mixture of furniture. Free continental breakfast hard to locate and about what you'd expect for free. Room was not ready at check in time so they deducted $10 off our bill. Will not stay there again. Ever. ',POOR,
'Good budget option for downtown OK, I'm tired of some of the finicky reviews of this place. It's a Quality Inn, for Pete's sake. Don't expect the Ritz. It's a perfectly fine 2* hotel. I was there for UW commencement and the city was busy, so this was the best I could do. I got a rate of $95 on Quikbook, and that was the best I could find ANYWHERE for this or any other decent property in downtown. When I arrived, I asked for two beds. The clerk was knowledgeable and efficient, and said she had only one left, but the rate would be $99. No problem. Still a deal for these dates. The lobby had a kind of Northwest lodge feel, with stone walls and floor. There was free coffee available and limited free newspapers. The elevator was kind of creaky and battered, and the guest room hallways were pretty shabby, but the room itself was spotless. Event the edges of the carpet seemed vacuumed, something I often don't see in 4* hotels. It had a beamed ceiling, again with the lodge feeling, and a microwave and mini-fridge. Plenty of room. Free wireless internet (although sometimes a weak signal). No problems with noise. The free breakfast was pretty abundant, although the breakfast room was crowded. There were signs about not taking away food, but my sister brought me stuff anyhow. No big deal. So I was perfectly satisfied. There's FREE parking! Some is in a lot alongside the street (Aurora), but there's also a hard-to-find garage. Go behind the hotel and completely around the block to the other side. You'll see a small Quality Inn sign over the entrance. You enter with your room key, so access is completely controlled. The elevator will take you all the way to the guest floors. I'd say the elevator was the biggest problem here: it was slow, old, creaky, and ugly. Otherwise, everything was fine. They even have a nice indoor pool off the lobby.The location was good. It's not in the thick of downtown, but DT is very accessible in a few minutes walk. If you exit the hotel and go right down Denny Way, there's an area with cafes and restaurants, and further down is the Space Needle food court. There's also a McDonalds near the Space Needle. If you go a few blocks north on Denny Way, there's a Whole Foods Market. And if you're in a hurry, there's a convenience store/gas station on the corner of Denny and Aurora, about 2 minutes walk.So I would not be afraid to stay here. I hope this hotel will move up in the rankings. ',GOOD,
'Decent hotel, nice location.       View out window 2 ',GOOD,
'OK if you just need a clean space to sleep... I just finished a 5-night stay from Comfort Suites Downtown Seattle and moved into this hotel down on the road for another night before heading back home. Boy was I surprised to see the difference of hotel facility between the two! I have stayed at other Quality Inn/Suites in the past but this one by far is my least favorite one. While Quality Inns/Suites is not the same as Comfort Inns/Suites but since they are operated under the same hotel family chain, I do expect equivalent or at least similar quality standard, especially when both hotels are only within 300 feet away from each other. Despite that the Quality Inn/Suites Downtown Seattle offers clean basic rooms with maybe 5-10% less in pricing, it is a somewhat run-down facility with a bear-cave feel - small, dark and old. I guess if you just want a simple basic place to stay for a day or two and are budget conscious, the Q hotel Seattle will be an okay choice. It is mediocre overall, upgrades are definitely needed for the hotel. ',POOR,
'Issues with the Quality Inn and Suites in Seattle We booked and stayed in two rooms. The one room had a telephone that did not work and a heater that did not work. Then there was a problem with the toilet in that room. These problems were taken care of after we complained. We stayed three nights and not once was the hot tub warm enough to sit in, even after we requested that they turn up the heat. The other room had bugs in the shower. ',POOR,
'Middle of the line hotel We stayed here for about 4 days. It is not a terrible hotel, however, things need an upgrade badly. The best thing about this hotel is free parking and location. I would only recommend this hotel to people who are on a budget and want a decent location, and who are spending most of their time out of the room. ',POOR,
'Horrible service, front desk gave key to stranger at 2 am My boyfriend and I were looking for a room with a jacuzzi in Seattle and this one was in our price range so I called them to book a room. The girl at the front desk told me in a very [----] and curt way that there was no rooms available for the dates I wanted, then hung up. I looked at the website and there were tons of rooms so I called back and was able to book a room for the exact same dates I said the first time with no trouble?!?!?! Should have been my first clue....Then when we get there she wouldn't process my Canadian debit card at the front desk and told me I needed to find an atm. She told me I could go up the street to a gas station. We did, but then the next day realized that there was an atm that worked fine for our card right in the lobby of the hotel?!?!!? THE WORST PART - At some point in the middle of the night, someone opened our room door. It caught on the chain but it opened. I woke up but wasn't sure if I was imagining it or what, so I just stayed awake all night after that. The next day we went down to breakfast and then tried to come back, and our key cards wouldn't work. We went to front desk and it turns out that when we paid the day before no one had bothered to check us in fully in the computer, so in the middle of the night the front desk guy gave our room to one of his friends.... Then he deactivated our keys because we weren't checked in?!?!? This hotel is disorganized and has terrible service. Also, the location isn't that great, but you can walk to downtown and its cheap. The jacuzzi was fun tho, I just don't recommend using bubble bath cause you can't control those bubbles with the jets on! ',POOR,
'Seattle stay The Quality Inn  Suites in Seattle is located three blocks from Seattle Center, home of the Space Needle. The area was originally built for the 1962 World's Fair. The area appears to be mostly offices and t.v. stations. We did walk a few blocks to find some restaurants and there is a food court in the Center House near the Space Needle. The monorail from Seattle Center runs to Westlake Center mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants.The hotel was built for the fair, but was added onto several years ago and recently the rooms were updated. Our room was rather small for four adults, but since we were out sightseeing most of the time it was fine. The room had 2 double beds and included a microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom had been updated with marble floor and new fixtures. The staff was friendly and helpful and we found the hotel to be clean. Although the hotel was full during our stay, our room was very quiet. The hotel is next to a very busy highway. With the window closed, the noise was not a problem. Parking is free at the hotel, which is great for a downtown hotel, but stalls are limited. They serve a nice breakfast, near the pool area. The breakfast room fills quickly, so the earlier you get there the better. Although the area around the hotel was not very tourist friendly, we thought the hotel was a bargain. $115/night for 4 adults, free breakfast, and free parking in downtown Seattle. ',POOR,
'great price, great location, great hotel This gem of a hotel was much better than I thought it would be. We came down to Seattle for a Seahawks game. The hotels in downtown Seattle were way too expensive for us, so we choose the Quality Inn which is only about a 15 - 20 min walk to downtown. Or you can take the Monorail which is only 2 blocks away from the hotel and takes you to Westlake Center. We took the shuttle bus to Qwest Field which only cost $5 return per person. We paid $112 (before taxes) for a room with two double beds. There's free parking. We saw plenty of available parking, so I'm not sure why other reviewers had problems. The complimentary breakfast was the best feature. Usually you just get cereal and baked goods, but here you get eggs, bacon, and potatoes. there's also a waffle maker, plus the usual pastries, cereal, tea, coffee, juice, etc. There's a huge indoor pool and hot tub. The room itself was clean and comfortable. There's a fridge and microwave which is unusual. I didn't like the pillows though because they flattened very easily so I had to ask for more. The staff was very helpful and courteous. No problems at the front desk whatsoever. All of the features combined with the proximity to downtown make this hotel a great stay. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Seattle. ',GOOD,
'What a dive!!!! Drapes looked like there had been a massacre in our room, balcony area (for smokers) was directly outside our room and had people partying and carrying on ALL NIGHT, bathroom was still dirty (spiderwebs under the sink), interupted by maintanence the next morning because my shower was leaking into the room beneath us, breakfast buffet resembled prison food with NOWHERE to sit...will never stay there again!!!! Was close to everything but we were afraid to move our car for fear of losing what few parking spots they had....were forced to take cabs at huge prices to go a few blocks. So much for giving my kids a nice getaway birthday weekend...the only good thing was Disney Princess Wishes on Ice at Key Arena. ',POOR,
'Great Bang for you Buck! Took wife and kids to Seattle for the weekend for a shopping trip. We had a great stay at this hotel...great comp breakfast and very nice for the kids to swim in an indoor pool in November.Excellent location as the space needle is 2 blocks away and easy to get to public transportation.When asked directions to shopping malls the girl went online and printed us mapquest directions to a couple malls.Will be back! ',GOOD,
'Great for limited budgets and easy going travelers! We stayed at the Quality Inn Seattle in August for 5 days and have to say that we would come back. We were unable to check in as we arrived early, but the staff were kind enough to check our bags and deliver them to the room when we checked in. We were on a limited budget, so our room was small, but comfortable and we only needed to ask for more pillows, blankets, etc. and they were delivered promptly. The bed was very comfortable, sheets clean and soft and the bathroom and rest of the room clean as well. We just wondered how those strange handprints got on the ceiling...? The breakfast is fantastic, but don't forget to bring your breakfast tickets! The pool was nice and open 24 hours and there is a great looking gymn available. We didn't use the gymn... hey, we were on vacation! but I saw others enjoying it.If you don't want to rent a car or pay for a taxi, you can walk the 2 blocks to the space needle and take the monorail downtown, where you can walk anywhere or catch a cab for a few less dollars. Just remember the monorail shuts down at night, so don't get stranded downtown. All in all it's a clean, comfortable place, wonderful all you can eat breakfast, not doughnuts and coffee like others and in a good location for a reasonable price. Ricky is the man if you need anything!Hi, Ricky and staff and thanks for everything!Christine ',GOOD,
'great value for money! we spent 3 nights at this motel and found it to be everything we could have wanted. It is a little further out of the city than we would have liked, but a short walk to the space needle where we caught the monorail into the city ($4pp return). Free parking, complimentary deluxe breakfast (superb!) and free wi-fi made this the choice for us. the decor is modern, clean and all rooms come standard with a fridge and microwave (something other places charge more for). there is a great market on the next block open 24 hrs. only downside is the lack of restaurants within walking distance. perfect otherwise! ',GOOD,
'Decent basic accommodations.... I stayed here on a 2 day pre Alaska cruise weekend with my partner  2 sets of parents. We had no real problems, except I thought the one elevator was mighty slow. Took the stairs most of the time. Service was friendly  pretty efficient ( when I needed extra pillows they were promptly delivered to my room). Breakfast was a nice variety of things including eggs, bacon, freshly made waffles, etc. Enough for morning sustenance. I got a great rate on Quikbook.com of $95.00, which was a bargain for that area. We walked to the Space Needle, the monorail,  also walked downtown both days. It is a nice walk  I felt safe no matter where I was in the city. ',POOR,
'You get what you pay for Quality Inn Downtown, 225 Aurora N, Seattle WA., You get what you pay forPeriod of stay: Septe,ber 16-20, 2007The location is conveintant to the space needle and especially the monorail, which will wisk you directly to downtown in a few minutes for a round trip fare of $2.00. However, I would suggest the Travel lodge, Holiday Inn Express or the Best Western which are all within blocks of one another. This like many other hotels in high tourist areas, takes in a lot of group tourists arriving on buses from various locations. Warm breakfast was very good, scrambled eggs and bacon, toast, bagels, coffee, juices, cereal and even waffels. Unfortunately you had to walk through the lobby and pool area to get to the dining area.The corporation obviously had purchased the facility from another chain. The renovations included new carpeting and wall covering in the halls, a refrig, microwave and coffee maker in the rooms and marble, yes marble, flooring, vanity and a new tub surround in the bath. They forgot the carpeting in the rooms, which were terrible. In our room, when we walked across the floor it loudly squeeked as though the flooring was not nailed down tightly below the carpet.The first night we had to change rooms because the walls were so paper thin that you could hear the voices in the next room speaking in their normal tone of voice. We moved at 11:00 p.m.The resturants in the area are supposed to be within walking distance, they are if you are a young adult or an avid jogger, we rented a car on the thiord day just to be able to get to the local resturants.The room rate was $130.00 per day, I would suggest paying a little more and finding a hotel closer to downtown. ',POOR,
'Will not stay here again! While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham, WA to San Diego, CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Seattle Quality Inn  Suites. Yes, the hotel was within walking distance of the Space Needle. However, when I requested a 2pm check-out (we did not check-in until after 7pm) as per the special services extended to Choice Privileges members, I was told the latest we could check-out was 1pm; the room was small; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed; only one elevator worked and it was slow; the complimentary in room coffee service was provide only for one person; after showering, the bathtub took forever to drain (over 8 minutes) and left behind scum; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room; the business center computer was out of order; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service. ',POOR,
'Parking Huge Problem Here This place was ok, as it was within walking distance to Space Needle and that area, but most everything else had to be reached by car. Parking was insufficient for Memorial Day weekend, as several underground parking garage spaces were taken by mattresses and other hotel furniture. Suite was ok but not as nice as it was depicted on website. Breakfast was ok most times, though too crowded on some days. ',POOR,
'Small but good value Stayed here for 6 nights on our first trip to Seattle. Picked this because of the location, price and free parking. Hotel is older, but apparently being renovated. They had a big air compressor in the parking lot and were working on the roof the whole time we were there.Rooms were small (about 10' x 12'), but clean. Ours was on the Aurora St. side and tended to be noisy during the day and early evening, because of the RT 99 traffic, but quieted down later in the evening.Our security lock was broken when we checked in and found that the tub didn't drain after the first night's shower. Told the desk, but it took them 2 days of repeated requests to make the repairs.Breakfast was good, but always crowded and most people ended up sharing tables. Parking was never a problem for us, even over a football weekend.Convenient location for Seattle Center, the Space Needle, EMP, Science Center, etc. ',POOR,
'Fine location, take care which room you stay in We stayed at Quality Inn and Suites, 225 N Aurora Avenue on two occasions in late August 2007. As I understand human nature, there will be different reactions to this hotel, some of which we shared. As an aside, try to get rooms on the odd # side of the house, preferably on 4th floor. Advantages are 1) view of Space Needle nearby and most importantly 2) the din from the traffic clogged Highway 29 Aurora Avenue permeates all of the even # rooms; you need to keep your A/C on just to sleep. This is a hotel that is being serially upgraded. The hot breakfast is really very nourishing and filling. Tends to be crowded at the end of the breakfast hour. Parking can be problematic; it is free but limited on site (on 1F and in basement. Parking spot is not guaranteed and you have to be creative sometimes about where you park). Location is outstanding for convenience (near Seattle Duck Tour, Seattle Center, monorail stop for access to downtown, Pike Market, etc.) As of 8/07 there was a shuttered up diner next door, the location was basically safe, looked dark and a bit forbidding coming in late at night. But this is a lively, crowded, active hotel. Long waits exist for the elevator. ',POOR,
'Should Have Listened Lost my online reservation and charged me twice for the room. Breakfast room turns into a cattle call and bathroom was not cleaned properly ie. shower curtain smelled of mildew. I read other reviews and refused to believe the negative comments. They were true. Do yourself a favor and don't stay. ',POOR,
'Was ok We spent two nights at The Quality Inn Suites before heading north toward the San Juan Islands. I chose it because it was close to Seattle Center. Our stay was pleasant, nothing fantastic. We had the King Select Suite 2.The pool was nice and the breakfast was good but the rest of the hotel was mediocre. We could tell that they did a lot of renovations to the bathrooms which was nice but the jacuzzi handle was broken so I had to call maintenance. The beds were old and a bit saggy but I could tell they were trying to keep things updated. Just not quite there yet.The hilarity was when we were ready to check out and we realized our 2-year old son had locked himself in the bedroom. He was fine (finally allowed to do what he wanted to do without us telling him no) but I think it took maintenance longer to come unlock the door than it did for them to come fix the tub handle. But, that might be b/c I was more anxious about getting the door open than having a nice bath.All in all, I probably would not stay here again. If I had gotten the room at a cheaper rate, perhaps, but not at the full price. ',POOR,
'left hand doesn't know what right is doing Desk clerks were not helpful as they should of been in getting the type of room we had booked 4 month's in advance.The maids and baggage handlers were very courteous and helpful.Ricky was the only desk clerk who seemed to know what he was doing.The pool was closed the three nights we were there with promises that it would open very soon.Double room which we did not book was much nicer than the two queen bed room we did book.

'Great Hotel! Just returned from a 2 night stay at this property, and could not have been happier! The staff was very friendly.Check in was simple, room was spacious. Frig, coffee pot, microwave all in room. Pool, spa and free hi speed computer available in lobby. If you bring your own laptop, free wireless hi speed in room! The very best thing about this hotel is the beds...extremely comfortable mattresses, with 3 down filled pillows and down comforter! Full breakfast daily, including eggs, bacon, waffles, yogurt, danish/bagels/toast, fruit, cereals, etc....truly a feast!2 block walk to convenient store for snacks. McDonalds also about 2 blocks. Short walk to Space Needle and Mono rail to mall. Then short walk to Pikes Place Market. Can't wait to return and would not hesitate to stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Much more than expected! Arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am following cruise. Hotel is not far from pier 66, but if you arrive by car and are not familiar with the roadway system getting to it may be a little daunting. Spotted it easily from the highway, but there aren't any turn-offs to get to it. You must drive down a distance( around 45th street), and then turn right in order to get back onto 99/Aurora St. going south. Once you do that the hotel is on the right about 3 miles up.Check-in was easy, although they didn't have any rooms available when we arrived, they will check your luggage. Received our parking placard, parked in their parking lot(free), then proceeded to walk 3-4 level blocks to the Space Needle, Experience Music Project(EMP), Pacific Science Museum. Once there you can take the monorail($2-adults, 0.75-youths) to downtown. Walk 2-3 blocks downhill to Pikes Public Market and waterfront. We were told that Pioneer's Square is not far from there, but since it was raining, we decided to go back. With all that said, I believe the hotel is in a great location.  Front desk friendly and helpful, coffee in lobby, pool, hot tub and sauna open 24 hours. Our room was a 2 double economy size which was adequate for our needs (2adults, 2teen-age boys and 1-2 medium sized pieces of luggage). Bathroom was small, but our room, hallways,and lobby were clean. I would recommend though, if you are staying for an extended stay to opt for one of their larger rooms.Breakfast was filling ;consisting of bacon, eggs, cereal, fruit, yogourt, juices coffee, danish, bagels. cubed potatoes self-make waffles.Other than the small bathroom and slow elevators(this gave us a chance to get some well needed exercise in and take the stairs). The hotel was much more than we expected, especially for the $95/night we paid.Oh yeah, check out was a breeze. They place the bill under your door the morning of departure. If there aren't any descrepancies, you just dial 0 to let them know you are leaving. ',GOOD,
'Disappointing Location Even though this hotel is less expensive than many hotels in Seattle, I don't feel like I got my money's worth. The location is not good if you are not travelling by car. It's a 25 minute walk to downtown (Pike Street) over busy streets and areas that I was not comfortable walking in alone. The hotel is right off the freeway. My room was very small and in dire need of an upgrade. Also, the hotel staff tried to convince me that a limo service was the cheapest mode of transportation to the airport when a cab is actually cheaper. I would recommend paying a bit more to stay downtown or, if you have a car, staying outside the city to get a bit more for your money. ',POOR,
'Not Recommended!! Upon arrival parked in parking garage. Elevator was out of order (had to go to an outside elevator any time we wanted to leave or get back up to our room). Upon check in discovered POOL was out of order. This was a weekend stay and the pool was OUT OF ORDER?? PUH-LEEZ!!! Room was TINY. Was a smoking room but had to call desk for ashtrays!Bed was hard and HIGHLY uncomfortable (with 2 dips in the mattress - not just one! Probably there since hotel opened!)! No heat in the bathroom but there WAS a gob of hair on the edge of the tub and on the floor mat draped over the tub. No tv station guide so, being from out of town, had no idea what station was what. The only GOOD thing was their free breakfast. Not just a continental breakfast like most hotels have but a full buffet with a variety of choices right down to making your own waffles. That definitely did not make up for the negatives. Quality?? NOT!! ',POOR,
'Loved the Service! I'm an employee for Quality Inn in Vancouver B.C. I was a bit skeptical at first for booking at this hotel. Being an employee of a hotel, you know all the good and the bad. Upon check-in, I was pleasantly surprised at the service. There was a coffee station and a view of the indoor pool where you check-in.The two gentleman (sorry, I didn't get the names) at the front desk were exceptional. They were friendly, polite and made me feel at home. Parking was a breeze and included with the price! (Considering this hotel is downtown and central to most attractions. Most downtown hotels in major cities charge ridiculous prices). The covered parking was a bit dim and the parking gates were wide open. The elevators are a bit slow, so I opted for the stairs instead.My room was great! However, my key cards didn't work, but the staff fixed the problem right way. I was suprised the room provided a fridge at no extra cost. The beds were comfortable and clean. (I could not find one piece of hair!) The shower was nice and hot and the pressure was strong. I requested an ironing board and it came within 5 minutes.I didn't take advantage of the breakfast or other amenities, there was just too much to do in Seattle than to stay in my room!Overall, this hotel was superb for the value and quality. The service made my stay a memorable one. They never once hesistated to answer my questions. ',GOOD,
'A variety of room sizes so look at it B4 you sign in! We should have asked Ricky the check-in clerk to show us the room he intended to give us before we signed for it. And we should have come right back downstairs and asked for a standard size room to replace the assigned closet size one. Although it was a quiet, non-smoking room with 2 beds as requested, our room 329 had almost zero floor space. No round table, no two chairs, no desk, no desk chair, no luggage rack, a very dinky sink counter left no room for toiletry kits, only one night stand for 2 queen beds, the 2 lamps (for the whole room) each had only an 18 watt compact flourescent bulb, closet pole 18 long. I kid you not when I say there was only 24 inches of floor space between the foot of the bed(s) and the dresser. BUT room 316 (with its door open for mtce), was a typical, 2 double bed room with all the furniture that was not in our room 329 plus a much larger sink counter and plenty of floor space. So this property DOES have larger rooms; ask Emily to give you one! Hot breakfast = A-; location = B+; property condition = B. We booked online with ChoiceHotels.com using our airline industry discount, $64/night + 16% tax during rainy, chilly, uncrowded early November 2006. Yes, we would return, as I now know the ropes! ',POOR,
'WOW Well done! Cool hotel! Great amenities, Pool, whirlpool, sauna, fitness room, and Fantastic breakfast! WOW the best we have ever had at any hotel with a free breakfast. Excellent and fast check in and out, great location, and parking was a bit tight, but we succeeded!We would definitly stay here again! ',GOOD,
'Not many complaints - overall good hotel! Bear with me - long review... but detailed for those who care!!!To start off, we looked for a hotel in downtown Seattle for we were going to the International District (Chinatown) for four days. My main preference was to have an indoor pool (who knows what the weather will do, so you can't go wrong with that,) and our budget was under $125/night. We got a deal of $100/night at Hotels.com and they indeed had an indoor pool. I've had interesting experiences renting hotels from just seeing websites, and this one was one of those times. The parking is BiZaRRe - not only does MapQuest or RandMcNally.com tell you they can't find it on the map, but if you find it yourself while driving around you only have 2 ways to enter the lot... if you overshoot the entrance then you end up on the frickin' highway. Moving on... check-in was crazy... a TON of people were having problems checking in (from online reservations of all things) and surprisingly when it was our turn they found our reservation easy and got us a parking permit and 2 keys without a problem. However, we booked a king and got to the room and it was 2 doubles, and 1 key didn't work. Bleh... I was tired and my husband and I just took advantage of more space and slept on the separate beds instead of stand in line to complain about that error. Bathroom was good, carpet was ok - not the horrible conditions I expected when reading everyone else's reviews. Thought maybe I'd have a view from the window, but all I got was a lovely view of the Travelodge right behind us (teeny tiny view of the Space Needle if you look at the right angle.) Definitely within walking distance to the Space Needle and only a few blocks to restaurants, the malls/stores downtown, and only a few (drivable) neighborhoods away from the International District. The pool's location isn't that great - right behind the hotel lobby (so much for privacy.) But the pool is really clean, and the adjacent hot tub was nice - could easily fit 8 (10 kids probably.) We opted for dim sum downtown every morning, but the one morning I decided to check out the breakfast I saw a pretty decent spread - lots of fresh bagels, huge fresh muffins, a juice machine, coffee, yoplait yogurt cups, and I saw them putting away eggs and turning off the waffle machine - and that's a lot of good food in my opinion. Overall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10 - only an 8 because they did screw up the room and the parking sucked - if there were no vacancies then there wouldn't be enough spots - good luck on the street. The Holiday Inn Express across the Street had the same parking issues, and the Travelodge behind us looked 4x more run down than where we stayed. But for the money and the indoor pool and the breakfast and location, I really don't have any major complaints. ',POOR,
'small  This place was a dump. The room was small, beds were uncomfortable  low to the ground, the carpet was gross, the noise from the street was constant and the night stand looked like it was picked up at a garage sale. Sorry we missed the breakfast everyone raves about. It was within walking distance to many sites. College kids would do well here, not recommended for a family stay. ',POOR,
'Worth the price This hotel was much better than expected. After seeing bad reviews i was quite surprised. The staff was very helpful. The food in the morning was better than expected. The neighborhood is a typical for a city this size. It is about a three block walk to the space needle. Never had a problem getting a parking spot, stayed for a week. The only problem was that the room was not very big. ',GOOD,
'Better than expected We were a bit disappointed at check-in. The lobby was rowdy and mistakes had been made with our reservation, but our patience paid off. The room , although small, was clean. We were on the Aurora Ave side, but heard no noise through the night. Slept quite well in fact. This is obviously an older hotel, so if you are going to Seattle to spend your time in a hotel, this would not be your choice. But if, like us, you need a convenient place to sleep, I would recommend it.The excellent breakfast every morning could cover a multitude of sins. There is no line if you go early. Hotel is very conveniently located. We walked everywhere. We received an excellent rate booking through Expedia. ',POOR,
'OK at the price Older hotel, somewhat run down. Our check in was quick. Our room had a king bed and was very, very small. The A/C was very noisy. Good breakfast, but dining area grungy looking.Hotel plus, it is convenient to the Space Needle.Their transport to Safeco Field is small shuttle bus, we were told it could handle 14 passengers. After realizing that it could not hold the crowd waiting we had the hotel call us a cab - never saw the shuttle in a 35 minute wait. It is a slow trip to the game at rush hour, don't see how the shuttle can make many trips back and forth. ',POOR,
'Avoid at All Costs This place is a nightmare! It is understaffed and messy. When we arrived around 10 PM, guests were three deep at the front desk, the telephone was continually ringing, and there was only one employee. We later found out that this lone employee had only been hired a week ago. While our room was clean, the medicinal smell from the cleaning fluids was overwhelming. The hallways and elevator were dirty and littered. This place has absolutely no appeal and not anywhere close to being worth $140.00 per night. ',POOR,
'Great value We stayed for 3 nights at the Quality Inn  Suites. We had a newly renovated room with a complete kitchen - even a dishwasher. The room was huge with plenty of space for a family with 2 teenage children and the children loved the pool. Even if it is not right in the city center it is close enough to walk to Pike Place market and only a few minutes walk to the space needle. We found the hotel clean and the staff friendly.The breakfast was good with fresh fruit and wafles, but the set up not very practical causing a long line from 8.30 onwards. All in all very good value for the money. ',GOOD,
'Huge disappointment! Spent the weekend as a girls weekend/Mom's weekend away. Plans included relaxing  shopping. Unfortunately there was no relaxing to be done at the hotel. It began with our reservation for two queens. When we arrived in the tiny room, we had two doubles. There was hardly room to walk around the beds, in fact the tv stand didn't even fit at the end of the bed, so they have it in the corner. The bathroom was tiny and with four ladies, the two sets of towels didn't cut it. We requested more towels and they never came. Saturday I wrote a note in English and Spanish requesting four sets of towels and left it in the room and that did the trick. We asked the front desk to call a cab and after waiting 20 minutes went back inside to confirm that they had called, and they forgot. (We were standing right outside their glass window.) The breakfast was only open 7-9am and there was a line snaking down the hall along with the tiny room bulging with people so we didn't attempt it. Upon arrival the shower had hair in it, and we had two used cups in the bathroom. The bedding was almost dirty appearing. Really dingy and scratchy. Old, flat pillows. We attempted to use the hot tub and it had a green film on the wall, along with about 4 inches of soapy bubbles. I reported to the front desk and was told that she told maintenance to take care of it a week ago. I do not believe it was sanitary, and therefore should not have been open. The hotel in on a highway, and does not represent their website's pictures in the slightest manner! Enough of my complaining, a huge disappointment (at $100 a night). ',POOR,
'Avoid this hotel! I recently stayed at the Quality Inn  Suites Seattle and was hugely disappointed. Place advertises parking, but the number of parking spots were limited (on a first come first serve basis, with available spots located in a dark scary basement). We had paid for a non-smoking room yet the room we were given had clouds of smoke still lingering along with numerous cigarette burns on the bed blankets! We assertively requested another room yet this new one had clearly not been cleaned as there was food still left on the dirty carpet floor. We were told there were no other rooms available. Elevators are limited and smelly. Breakfast room had seating for only say 20 people, so this forced people to wait in a long line that wound all the way back to the poolside area (many like us gave up and went elsewhere). Hotel was clearly understaffed; we waited 10-15 minutes for a staff member to assist us when arriving and trying to check in. Staff were friendly, but themselves seemed frustrated by the chaotic environment of the hotel. Take our advice and go elsewhere! ',POOR,
'An ok hotel After reading some not so great reviews, this hotel wasn't too bad. My boyfriend and I were with his family (we had a total of 3 rooms) who of course had better rooms than us but that's ok. Our room however had peeling wallpaper and a crack in the wall, but otherwise was pretty clean. We were in the back so we didn't hear any highway noise like people spoke about in previous reviews. One thing I didn't like about our room was that the one and only mirror was in the bathroom above the sink which made for a pain when I was getting ready. The other rooms had the sink and mirror outside the bathroom. The breakfast was good just crowded and the elevator worked while we were there unlike previous reviews mentioned. The Space Needle is literally 3 blocks from the hotel which is nice and the area seemed ok not too seedy, but we weren't out late so I'm not sure how it was after 11:00. It was ok for one night but I probably wouldn't stay here again, I'd spend the extra money for a better place. ',POOR,
'Not Worth the Money! Reasons why it sucked:1. the room smelled2. the front desk was not helpful at all when it came to tourist advice 3. it is right off the highway4. the immediate area around the hotel is very sketchy5. I questioned the cleanliness of the hotel constantlyReasons why it's ok:1. about a 5 minute walk from the space needle2. breakfast looked ok, although I never tried itOverall, I'm a budget traveller and $107/night is a lot of for me. It was ok because of its proximity to the tourist area, but they shouldn't be able to get away with such aweful rooms for so much a night. ',POOR,
'Great pool, better staff, best breakfast The free breakfast was the best breakfast I've had at a hotel, including full-service hotels where you have to pay! It topped off a great stay that I was worried would be doomed from the start. It didn't begin so great because Mapquest gave me impossible directions. DON'T TAKE 99 TO GET THERE! I had to call the hotel and the guy at the front desk got me back on track, he seemed like he'd done that a lot before. Keeping the pool  hot tub open 24 hours was a nice touch, too. Staff was on top of things- when they initially ran out of pool towels the staff ended up coming out from the desk  bringing replacements right out of the dryer to me! ',GOOD,
'Truly a dive, and I don't mean the pool area The neighborhood wasn't very good, and didn't seem real safe. It is literally on the corner of a street also known as a highway, and traffic noise was loud. Our room had a sliding door in it out to the balcony (we were on the 3rd floor). The balcony was only about 2-3 feet wide, and overlooked the traffic and the roof below. This sliding door was broken and I couldn't lock it. We didn't want to leave any doors unlocked in that neighborhood. It must have been broken for awhile, because there was a wooden dowel in the slider to keep it closed. I expect more than a 39 cent wooden stick to secure the place for what I paid for that room. It was over $100 for that night even after they made an adjustment for the broken door and noise inconvenience. The roof below is open at night so people can go out there and smoke/party/whatever. Some girls were giggling and screaming most of the night. The elevator was broken and out of order. The room was depressing looking, as was the whole place. The breakfast in the morning was boring and tasteless. I could have gotten a better one at the local 7-11. On the bright side, at least now I know where NOT to stay when I go back. ',POOR,
'good for travelers on a budget positives: great breakfast buffet, quiet room(i was not facing the highway though), price($71), location in citynegatives: hotel could use some renovation, breakfast room way too small, elevators not all working.  the room and dining room were clean. the pool area was questionable, it just seemed old and overly used and in a terrible location (right off the lobby) definitely not a luxury hotel, and i would hate to stay there during busier times. but a decent choice for those on a budget. ',POOR,
'HORRIBLE!! The worst lodging experience of my life. We (my husband and two of our children) booked and scheduled a late check-in after the Seattle AMA Supercross. The initial check-in was good then it all went down hill from there!! There was no parking available at all so the desk clerk told us his shift was over in 5 minutes and told us where he was parked so we could take his parking space when he left. We went to our car and pulled off to the side next to his car and waited in the car (with kids that had to pee!) for 45 MINUTES for his shift to be over. When he finally left, he came out with another guest and gave the parking spot to them. We questioned him and reminded him he had offered the spot to us and said oh, well I decided to give the spot to these people instead. The other desk clerk was rude and no help either. Her response was that we would just have to drive around downtown Seattle until we found somewhere to park. There were 12 other guests checking in after the Supercross as well that were all complaining of the same problem and not getting any help or alternative suggestions. The group of unhappy guests finally took it upon themselves to double park in the hotell parking lot after approximately an hour (which made it about midnight!) of frustration.When we finally got to our room, it was tiny and didn't have the amenities they had listed on the hotels.com web site. There were two used water cups left in the room that room service didn't clean up and no clean cups for water or coffee. The rest of the room was clean though.Then, if the check-in wasn't bad enough, we were awakened at 4am to a HUGE fight in the hallway between what sounded to be guests and hotel staff. It went on for about 20 minutes and got heated enough that I was afraid to go to the door and ask if they would keep the noise down. I was very fearful that it was going to turn violent.We were awakened again about 8am by noisy neighbors. The walls seem to be very thin and not noise proof at all. There was a coffee pot in the room but no coffee, creamer, cups, etc. There wasn't even a water cup in the room so that we could get a drink of water or take medicine. When we went to take a shower, we found a used wash cloth left hanging over the shower rail.All in all, the stay was miserable. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms were tiny, the walls were thin, there was no parking available anywhere and the attitudes of the night staff was rude and disrespectful. I don't stay out of town often so I don't have high expectations at all but this stay didn't even come close to meeting our expectations. ',POOR,
'Could use some upgrading Stayed here for two nights while attending an event at a neighboring hotel.I was able to find parking when I arrived on Friday afternoon.Check-in was a little inefficient as the person who was checking me in kept running to the back room for instructions... then referred to a paper list for what rooms were available for the bed type (King) that I'd selected.Received two keycards and proceeded to the 3rd floor. Neither keycard opened the door. Returned to front desk where they re-encoded the keycards and gave me a regular key.Neither keycard worked, but the key did.King bed took up most of the room. There was room for a nightstand on both sides and then a desk on one side. TV armoire was in the corner, but the drawers were difficult to open.They need to buy sheets that fit the beds.. the fitted sheet on the bottom kept slipping off during the night.There was free wireless internet available and it worked fine the whole weekend.Breakfast was most excellent... best hotel breakfast I've had in a while.Saturday night I got the last parking spot in the north end parking area.I paid $70 plus tax per night. I would stay here again for that price... but would look elsewhere if it was priced higher.... ',POOR,
'Can't Recommend My husband and I stayed at Quality Inn Seattle in April 2006 for two nights. We had intended to stay four nights but had to leave early due to illness. We plan to return to Seattle next year but I would not stay at this hotel again. It was quite shabby both outside and in and it does not appear that the hotel is kept up very well. I did not realize that the hotel was so close to busy roads and the window of our room looked out over the highway traffic. The room was very small, cramped with the bed taking up all of the space. The room was barely clean, not well furnished, the mattress old and the bedding sparse. We found the room to be rather depressing and the bathroom was also small. The elevators were unreliable. Although the parking was free, hotel staff could not guarantee that we would have a space if we left with our car and returned. This made us feel nervous about leaving the hotel with our car. The breakfast was very plentiful, more choices of food than I've seen at most hotels but the room was very crowded, unpleasant looking and it was difficult to manuever around everything. The layout of the hotel is awkward as well. It appears that the hotel needs a complete renovation. I learned a lesson from staying here that in the future I will pay an extra $20.00+ per night if necessary and stay in a place that has a clean, attractive and cheery atmosphere with rooms large enough to move around in. I did appreciate that when we had to check out of the hotel earlier than planned, we were not charged for the two nights we had planned to stay. ',POOR,
'Best buffet breakfast ever We stayed one night, so we won't complain. The room was small for a family of four, but only $70. The bathroom tiny.The pool was fine, but the hot tub was not functioning. Free parking, suitable location right near the Space Needle. The breakfast was the best of the best. That was probably worth about $50 alone! More food than you could imagine. We even made our own waffles. The best.Come for the price. Come for the breakfast. Come for the free parking. With all the amenities, we can't complain. ',POOR,
'No internet service as stated... 1st. No internet connection like it was hyped up to be free?.2nd. When I called to tell them this they refered me to some 1-866 number that told me to install a disk that will allow my ethernet to connect to the dsl they use?.3rd. That was nonsense and just a runaround...4th. The rooms were hollow to a point I could hear the people next to me make loud noise which were intimate in a sense ALL NITE LONG...5th. When I tried to call them to get a wake up call they forgot? ',POOR,
'Very Close to the Space Needle... Basically we wanted the closest budget hotel/motel to Seattle Center that had free parking AND a free breakfast; these two features are worth probably $30/day alone (for a family of 4).Parking was not a problem and there were a limited number of covered spaces as well. The breakfast is a full buffet and tends to get very busy about 45 minutes before closing (0930). Coffee is good, and bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, etc. make it worth the 5-10 minute wait.The indoor pool/hot tub is nice, especially with kids, and is open 24/7.The rooms are a little tired but include a fridge and microwave.Location is great - maybe 5 minutes to the Space Needle. You can walk to the Pike Place Market as well in 20-25 minutes or so.The only real downside to this property is its age, though they were renovating while we were there. The pool area and halls didn't seem particularly clean but it wasn't really a problem. I have seen comments about no restaurants close by but there is a full food court near the Space Needle that was open until 7 p.m. while we were there. We also walked downtown to numerous restaurants (20 minutes) but could have taken the free bus if the weather was bad. McDonald's is only a couple blocks away as well...All in all, not a bad deal for the location. Honestly, if you are a tourist on a budget then why would you want to spend 2 or 3 times as much for a fancy property? Spend the money on a nice restaurant, the local attractions or whatever! ',POOR,
'You get what you pay for If we had spent an extra $20 per night we would have stayed in $100 worth of a better hotel. Our family of 4 booked this hotel because it looked like good value and had a nice looking pool (on the website).At $86 cdn per night, we really did get just what we paid for. We might have saved $20 each mornig at the complimentary breakfast, so that didn't leave a lot of wiggle room for the facility to provide the little things that make the stay pleasant.We never did swim in the pool, it wasn't very inviting in person. Its location, next to the lobby separated the lobby from the rest of the main floor the windows looked out onto the adjacent freeway. Staff and guests would regularly walk through on the deck in street shoes to get to the other side of the building. The hot tub was a residential type, placed on top of the pool deck. There are no changerooms.Our room was very small, beds and pillows were old. the temperature is controlled by a loud A/C unit.The Bathroom had recently been given a makeover. I was looking longingly out our window at the Holiday Inn Express across the street.The location was good for access to Seattle Center, but a $7 cab ride was required to get downtown or out to eat. It's also dificult for cabs to access because its on the southbound side of Hiway 99. ',POOR,
'Decent and great location We used this hotel for a trip to the Nutcracker. I thought it smelled like old chinese food but the the pool, breakfast, and service was really good. The rate was good too considering we had 5 girls. I would say average. ',POOR,
'Worst Ever! The rooms were old, worn out and dirty. We were in the honeymoon suite and every time you shut the door the metal utility door fell off the hottub. I don't know if they have ever cleaned the carpets, our socks were black on the bottom in less than five minutes. None of the cleaning staff spoke any english and just forget about getting any help from the front desk. Half way through our stay I requested a list of the hotel charges to date and was told that the accountant does that and I would have to wait until the next day when they came in ( I guess they just didn't know how to do it and couldn't think up a better lie). The breakfast was good, however not nearly good enought to justify the rest of the nonsense. Save yourself the trouble and stay elsewhere. ',POOR,
'Good value motor lodge I stayed here 1 Saturday night. This is definitely not a Hyatt Regency (where I stayed on business the night before), but it is good value for its class - it is conveniently located, clean, comfortable and affordably priced. This is an updated 1960s motor lodge - about 150 rooms on 3 floors, with plentiful free parking on the ground and lower levels. The desk clerk graciously gave me a complementary upgrade from a king room to a double queen room, when I asked to be on the back side of the hotel. The room was good sized, clean and comfortable. The decor was simple and bland, but the furniture was solid wood. The bathroom was small, but both the floor and one-piece bathtub set appeared brand new. The only downsides were that the small window unit didn't cool or warm the room very quickly, and the small window just looked onto the Travelodge next door. There is a free hot breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage and fresh waffles. The motel is right between the Holiday Inn and HI Express (on the other side of highway 99) and the Travelodge and Best Western. Route 99 can be busy and loud at times, and the area is a bit deserted but safe at night. The hotel is 3 blocks from the Space Needle, but there are no restaurants or much of anything in the area. Nice place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep while seeing Seattle. ',GOOD,
'Nice clean hotel at great price! This is not the Grand Hyatt, but it doesn't cost an arm and a leg either! A good convenient location, within walking distance of all neighborhoods, a clean room, great staff, very good free breakfast, free parking. With advance planning, I was able to stay for $53 a night, which included covered parking and a full breakfast. I never moved my car; I used the free bus service (only 4-5 blocks away) or walked. It was great!!Quality Inn is to be commended on their hard work in making this a pleasant option for reasonably-priced accomodation in Seattle. These are not luxury rooms, but clean and comfortable. No complaints from me; I will stay here again!! ',GOOD,
'Definite Improvement This place is definitely on the up  up. I always stay here when I come to town (twice a year) mainly for the pool, breakfast,  free parking. Sure, it's an older hotel, but I'd never been choosy otherwise because the good outweighed the bad  it's under $100. Lately I've noticed the improvements as they've remodeled, and the desk staff doesn't get beat up anymore by people with their picky problems. (Seriously people, your life is not going to end if your TV is fuzzy. Quit freaking out on the kid at the desk.) I met the new manager at breakfast and mentioned this, and he upgraded my room to a suite! That's style. This place is definitely heading in the right direction. ',GOOD,
'Great value!!! I don't understand all the negative reviews. We stayed 3 nights there last week and we thought for the price and location it was a pretty great value. It's located 3 blocks from the Space Needle, where you can catch the monorail and be right downtown in a few minutes. The parking is off-street and free. The staff was absolutely wonderful, the rooms were clean and spacious. The beds are comfortable and they have a large indoor pool. I was also surprised by the free breakfast. I was expecting cereal and rolls and instead they actually have a full, hot breakfast. We are looking forward to our next stay there. ',GOOD,
'What A Dump! We booked this hotel because it offered free off-street parking and was near the Space Needle.When we arrived they didn't have our reservation because their FAX machine was broken. (That should have been our first hint.)Only one elevator was working; and from the sound of it, that was iffy. We often shared the ride with cleaning people and dirty linens.The room was small and barren. (I've stayed in boutique hotels for less.)After the first day our room key did not work. I guess no one could stand this place for more than that. The dining area for the Comp breakfast was understaffed and unclean.The entire hotel seemed to be in some sort of repair of disrepair. The front desk personnel were pleasant, but useless. They were always making excuses for bad service. There was always a guest there complaining about something. Even the snack and soda machines did not work.The really disturbing point is that Cruise lines and Travel agents are sending their clients there. They should be warned. ',POOR,
'Breakfast Was Great We were satisfied with this hotel. The front desk staff was great. We were there before noon (we didn't realize how close Bellingham was!) and were still able to get our room. Later on, when we were asking directions to the Zoo, the clerk offered us her own personal coupons for the Zoo!The room was quite small with not a lot of extra room. There was also an extra chair in the room that was rather rickety, but we took a chance and sat in it anyway. There was enough room though for the four of us (two adults and two children). The room was clean enough and there were lots of supplies in the bathroom. Our room looked over Highway 99, but the noise was not too bad. The hotel is in a great location - just a short walk to the Space Needle, Seattle Centre and the monorail that will take you to downtown.I think Quality has just recently bought this hotel as there seem to be renovations going on. While we were there, maintenance was being done on the hottub. The breakfast was amazing. We knew that breakfast was provided and were expecting muffins, cereal and maybe fruit. We couldn't believe it when we walked in to scrambled eggs, bacon, sausauge, bagels, toast, cereal, do-it-yourself waffles and a variety of beverages. We were able to get a table (it was between 8 and 8:30 am). It seemed to be getting quite crowded but then we noticed that they had also opened an additional conference room for more people and it was still empty.We would probably stay here again, particularly if we wanted to partake of the attractions at Seattle Centre. ',POOR,
'Horrible stay, stolen credit card number Not only did my credit card number coincidentally get stolen the day after our stay, the hotel did not meet my expectations. But then, for the cheap rate, I should have known. I will never stay there again! ',POOR,
'Seedy I was surprised to learn from the other reviews that the hotel had recently been remodeled, because my first reaction upon checking in was that it seemed outdated. Perhaps we were put in one of the older rooms. The elevator was sketchy, the halls were dark and scary and had people just hanging out in them chatting (late at night), and the room was dirty. I don't think the sheets had been washed--seriously. And there was a hole burned by a cigarette in the comforter (in a non-smoking room). Hair in the beds and bathroom. We begged the front desk clerk for mercy and changed hotels before even unpacking. ',POOR,
'If you have kids- stay here! This hotel is in a great location and is very reasonably priced. Staff was very friendly and recommended a wonderful pizza place (Milano's) that delivers in 35 min. They also give great directions! If you have kids, they'll love the pool/ hot tub and make your own waffles at breakfast! It's about 3 blocks from the space needle where you can catch the monorail to go downtown. This makes everything within walking distance for a family. I would definately stay here again.  ',POOR,
'Great Price and Great Location This is just a average hotel. Our Room was very clean and the staff was very helpful. 3 blocks from seattle center made it easy to get around without a car. I will stay here again with my family. ',POOR,
'So much better I stayed a few years ago and it was not that great, I decided to give it another try and was very happy!! Other then the cold lobby, everything else was wonderful!! ',GOOD,
'Worth less than the low price The staff tried hard, the high speed internet is great, (I am writing you from the room) but otherwise, bad news. One of 3 evelator works, some of the time; they didn't make up our room today; the free breakfast was fine but the line was out the door to get to it. The listing on the net said there was a workout room but it is closed. We actually had to complain and switch rooms to get the internet; the web site implied every room but, not yet. The price was great but I fear it didn't buy much. ',POOR,

'Just make sure you get good rates I stayed here simply because I was working with a client and they were staying here as well. My company paid premium dollars ($349) per night because by the time I booked the only rooms available were Ocean View Executive Suites and I have to say, before I went, I was quite excited at the thought of staying in such a room. However, the reality was quite different (or maybe they put me into an ordinary room and pocketed the difference). Let's put it this way - if this is their Executive Suite then I would hate to see the standard rooms. There was a sitting room area that you entered first and then the bathroom and then the bedroom. It was all very ordinary and definitely not what I expected. To top it all off I was on a low floor and so didnt have much of a view at all - only really of the kiddies playground by the swimming pool. I did have glimpses of the bay area and I could just about see the jets as they came in to land. Apart from that , the room stank of cigarette smoke and I had to get an ionizer brought up.The location, however, is good and I do agree if you need an airport stopover that is is probably a way better choice if you dont mind the taxi fare to here (as opposed to shuttle buses for the airport hotels). The restaurants around here are truly great and I would be amazed if anyone couldnt find somewhere to eat that they enjoyed. On top of that the hotel itself has quite a good complex of shops and places to eat so all in all it is a good placce to stay but justmake sure you get a good deal thats all.I think if you do a deal with the hotel and it includes breakfast etc then it is possibly worth it but honestly I was super disappointed especially considering what my Company paid for this. So make sure that you get a good rate and make sure you have a room on a high floor with proper Ocean Views and this would be a good place to stay. ',POOR,
'A good hotel for a conference I did not choose to stay at the Novotel Brighton Beach, it was booked for me to stay at while I was at a conference.Check in was fast and the rooms were very clean  spacious. The cleaning ladies were very polite  thorough. My room had a lounge room and bedroom which was separated by the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. The room also had a nice balcony with views over the water to the city in the background.Breakfast was really good with lots of choice of hot  cold foods, such as eggs, cereals, several different breads, juices coffee  lots more.The gym is complimentary and also great. Lots of cardio machines, and all very modern.All in all, the Novotel was a very clean comfortable place to stay for work. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is because Brighton Beach is not an area that I would recommend to stay at in Sydney unless it is a stopover as it is close to the airport. ',GOOD,
'A good experience overall I had to write an exam in Sydney and requested a room away from street noise when I made my booking. Not only did they give me a room as requested but they upgraded me to a suite at no extra charge. I though the staff were very friendly and efficient. Check in was easy and quick. The room was clean although a little bit musty smelling when I arrived. Its a nice location, 5 mins from the airport, across the road from the beach, and there are loads of eateries in the area. Given the reason for my visit, I didn鈥檛 get to use any of the amenities at the hotel so I cant comment on those. ',GOOD,
'Real problems with checkin Recently stayed here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. The service was appalling. Arrived at 2.00pm and two rooms booked were not ready. The group was going out for dinner so availability of only one room for the group all requiring showers before dinner was to say the least annoying.We all used the room to shower and dress and went to dinner. Second room became available at 7.30pm. As it was a celebration one of our party asked the reception upon arrival to store some champagne. It was agreed that it would be taken up to the room with some ice and glasses when the room became available. This was delivered hours later with no ice or glasses.Hotel blamed staff being sick for problems with rooms. After complaining the group was given a free breakfast and car parking.When you plan a special occasion you put your trust in the hotel to deliver a room by at least 3.00pm and keep commitments.Never again will we use this hotel. If you cannot deliver rooms you don鈥檛 deserve customers. ',POOR,
'Mixed thoughts about the Novotel I stayed at the Novotel on Christmas night and got a special price - but their normal rate looks overpriced for what you get. we were in a Bay side suite which has a litlle separate lounge area from the bedroom. this gave us plenty of room. View was half Bay (which is not very exciting) - half city. Everything was fine - bed comfy, pillows comfy etc. Old TVs with a couple of extra cable channels - worked fine. usual mini bar. We only got 1 towel in the room (and no bath robes) so that was a bit damp. I was surprised that the bathroom is all marble and gold and then really cheap white plastic, chipped tap handles. Usual array of usual standard toiletries. Only 1 cockroach visited us in the night. reasonable sound control from the planes and traffic.Being Boxing Day the health centre was closed - so no indoor pool. Heaps of kiddies were making good use of the outdoor pool. My big gripe was the christmas dinner buffet. We paid a whopping amount to have a special christmas buffet only to arrive and find that they were doing the usual buffet with a few extra touches. Inquiries brought the response that the chef thought the christmas advertisement was wrong and so the special meals were not going to be cooked. This must surely be some form of false advertising and no discount was offered!The breakfast buffet was the usual fare. I think you could do better with your money in Sydney ',POOR,
'Nice place, watch the detail As you would expect in this price category the hotel is excellent. Nicely located within $20 taxi of the airport with a good selection of restaurants in and around the hotel. Although I was at the hotel on business, there were plenty of sunburnt holiday makers.Check-in all OK and my booking was correctly handled. I was upgraded to a Bayview Suite which was appreciated. I had an in room meeting with two other guests that day and the extra space was needed. In room furnishings were in good order.Some areas of the hotel were showing their ware. On first arrival onto my level I fel tthe hall smelt musty and the carpets looked worn. This was also the case in room where the carpets are looking worn in the doorways.In the rooms there were some minor issues. An old Pringles packet in my bedroom cupboard. A neighbours breakfast tray was left to sit in the hall from 8am to at least 8pm that night. On checkout there was an attempted mini-bar charge for jelly beans which were still in the room. Not sure what they were up to with that one.Overall, a very pleasant stay and I would like to go back, although next time on holiday allowing more time to enjoy the facilities.By the way, if you are a seafood lover, try Petas restaurant opposite the hotel it was excellent. ',GOOD,
'Great location and service I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I found the staff to be very friendly. I was upgraded to a Bayview suite which was lovely. I had a large room with separate lounge room, bathroom  bedroom. I had 2 Televisions a large balcony overlooking the water, the city skyline and the airport. The location was superb, located across the road from Brighton Beach. Outside the hotel dozens of restaurants and shops, even a Coles Supermarket. Great location and friendly staff, I would definitely return. ',GOOD,
'Good location. Good service. Good room I booked this hotel due to its location. It is 15 minutes from the airport and right across the road from a Botany Bay beach.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I received an upgrade to a Bayview Suite and I loved the room. It had a great view out to the bay. The only complaint was there was no room in the toilet. If you are claustrophobic or trucking a little too much in the backside you may have trouble.The buffet breakfast is awesome. The buffet dinner was disappointing.Overall though, a very good hotel. ',GOOD,
'Less than expected Stayed in a Bayview Suite for 3 nights (7-9 Feb) for a conference held at the hotel.Room: Our room had an internal door and thus a separate lounge area (with sofa that would have been a second bed if required) to the bedroom. The door is good for having the office available for work and to keep the bedroom quiet -- although the airport is not far away, so the jet engines are easy to hear. Mascot (Sydney international airport) does have a night curfew though. We had nice views of both Botany Bay and the Sydney CBD skyline, although half the hotel just faces the bay, not the CBD (L-shape).The bathroom design was a little awkward -- the toilet shoved in next to a separate shower, with not much manoevering room. You'd want not to be a bigger framed person (as I am), as you'd find the toilet placement a little uncomfortable. Something to put up with only on a short-term basis, although better toilets on the conference level of the hotel. I'd rather the shower and bath together to not have to squeeze in the toilet.We had some ants in the room (and one wandering cockroach, who we put back outside -- we guess he probably came in through the balcony door). The ants weren't prolific, but a little annoying wandering around the lounge area and bathroom. Not enough though to ask housekeeping to attend to them.Soft bed, pillows ok and 2 tvs with limited channels. We had to get the battery changed in the remote, but that's a random chance of happening I guess.Staff were okay. No sign of concierge/door staff to help with our bags on check-in though -- the lobby was deserted in that respect, so our up to us with the bags, even after checking in. It was also worth re-confirming the booking by phone the day before we arrived, as the hotel had only put down nights, not 3 as originally booked. And we also were originally told it might be hard to get a room with a king bed (rather than twin beds) -- although on our second call the hotel staff member was surprised by this information -- and assured me king beds were the main option (all beds king, not queen or double).Facilities: The conference facilities were fine, food and seating typical for this style of hotel. The business centre must have been out of order: there were only 3 computers inside the front foyer of the hotel with abysmal printing facilities: a small laser printer with toner saver turned on -- at $0.20 per page for awful toner coverage, it wasn't suitable for any business purposes. Perhaps there is another centre in the hotel that usually operates? My wife was directed to the foyer computers for this purpose: coin operated, not too hard to use, but useless printing facilities for business documents.The hotel's internet access was provided by outsourcing ISP Azure, and was wireless. My 1-month old PC's wireless was too new, and I had to use a wireless bridge (supplied by the hotel for free, but then not very practical to take my notebook PC into the conference room with the added peripheral and need for a power outlet). This service was $20/day surcharge, or $66 for 10 hours (less hours were available). Bandwidth varied, from really slow to low end of broadband -- download speeds from 3kb/sec to about 35kb/sec. Thankfully I knew how to disable my wireless connection and enable a LAN connection for my notebook PC -- it did require some IT skills to get it setup and working.The pool and outdoor gardens were closed for renovation -- black plastic bordered the restaurant so the whole outdoor area was not visible during our stay. This wasn't mentioned when booking, although as we were there specifically for a conference it didn't spoil any plans.Food: We had room service dinner twice in 3 nights -- and had a side of fries with tomato relish on one occasion. The relish turned out to be plain tomato sauce in a little jar, but otherwise the service was prompt (to the time they said they'd take -- about 15 mins one night and 30 mins the next). Pricing was pricey, but typical and expected for this type of hotel. There was a convenience store outside the hotel, but under the same roofline: this was very pricey and not temperature controlled, so some food on the shelves was soft/melted. And at $6.95 for a 100g packet of chips/crisps, this was not your usual 7/11 pricing!Food in the restaurant for lunch (conference buffet) and breakfast (full buffet) was fine and nice quality. Plenty of seating, although on a sunny day, the sun in the east-facing windows (and the reflections off Botany Bay) was too bright so we sought seating away from the view (plenty to choose from).Nearby restaurants were affordable, relaxed and very enjoyable, less than 2 minutes walk from the hotel lobby. There's a food court as well as some cafes and the main shopping street for Brighton-le-Sands, so good range of choices.If I had a choice, I wouldn't book here again. If I had a car in Sydney, I'd probably find somewhere nicer to stay and drive to the venue each day. (After 20-odd trips to Sydney, I'm feeling now like I'd be comfortable driving -- Sydney drivers seem more chaotic compared to Melbourne, where I live!). But I'd stay here again if it was required for a conference venue (I don't think there is much other choice in the area south of the airport, and certainly not much convenient public transport other than taxis of course).Overall, rating of average.

'Ok but could be better!       View over the Restaurant ',POOR,
'Could be better We stayed here again enroute to the US mainly because of proximity to the airport and it was pretty good when we stayed here last year. We booked a suite for $20 more so we had more room. It is not a cheap hotel in our view so look for good deals. The king bed was very comfortable but there was no bed for the two teenagers. The queen bed advertised turned out to be a sofa bed which we had to ask to be made up. Quite frankly, if I were the hotel manager I would have been embarrassed by the dilapidated state of the sofa bed. The matress was literally undulating! It was falling to bits. They left only one pillow so we had to ring again and ask for more which were delivered promptly. The towels left for the kids were thin and fraying. The location is great and the pool and garden area are very nice. There is a walkway to the beach. The room had views of the garden area, the bay and the airport. Next time, I think we'll look around for something else. ',POOR,
'Just OK We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in August 2006. It was OK but I would have expected more for the price. The room was average, the TV didnt work and the staff were indifferent. We were offered another room as the TV didnt work but because we had already unpacked and it was just one night we declined. The outdoor pool was very nice with a waterslide for the kids but it was cold(not heated in winter). The location of the hotel is pretty good, there are lots of nice restuarants around and the water across the road but it was quite noisy and the rooms were not very soundproof. Whilst we have no real complaints I just thought the hotel was very average for the high price charged. It is close to the airport and there was plenty of underground parking for $15 per night.

'Good value, but could be much more. On street front, noisy but double-paned glass works. Centrally located to walk everywhere, and safe. Very clean room  bathroom. Small beds and bed-fitting blankets, not good for big people. Limited tv. Good AC. No 110V power port, but adapter available sometimes at front desk. Free wi-fi internet in lobby only, and it was a bit slow. Restaurant bar in lobby looked nice, and had good coffee. No free breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Nearby market, shops, food. Flower market walk down the street. ',POOR,
'very hot and loud In Amsterdam for a 4-day stay. Would never recommend this hotel during warm weather as there is no AC and the room was very hot. We couldn't open the windows at night because we had a room at the front of the hotel and the street noise was so loud. Shower flooded the room resulting in a foul smell from the carpet. The king size bed was two twins pushed together resulting in a crack in the middle of the bed which you would slip in to. The breakfast was anything but grand as was our experience with this hotel. Also-very explicit porn on the TV regardless or whether it is puchased. Would not recommend for children. The only positive thing about this hotel is that you don't want to spend in time in your room as it is so uncomfortable and the great location. That being said-there are other hotels with good locations in which to stay. ',POOR,
'Great choice for a short break Quite a good location - could walk/tram to most major tourist attractions in the city. Some nice places to eat/drink close by too.Room good value for a major European city. We went for a Deluxe room - worth the upgrade for the late check-out alone (2pm)!Breakfast v.good, with a wide range of options, including many suitable for vegetarians.Friendly  efficient staff on reception.Would recommend it. ',GOOD,
'Great location The train station has a facility to print a map to the hotel of your choice. We walked from the station to the Albus Grand. (Plenty of trams available for only 1.60 Euro) Once there we were upgraded as all non smoking standard rooms were full. The deluxe room was very comfortable and clean. Some road traffic noise had to be offset against the super location. Restaurants and bars close by. Staff very helpful and friendly. We did not have breakfast in the hotel but many people did. The get together restaurant did not seem to attract people in the evening but so many other interesting places close by this was not a problem. We had breakfast in Rembrandtsplein watching people catching trams and cycling around. Easy walking distance to all attractions and close by the canal boat stop. We would definitely stay there again.

'Booked short notice, good experience My g/f had a long weekend off and decided she wanted to meet me in Amsterdam. Well, after doing some searching trying to find a place to stay on short notice during peak tourist season, I came across this place. I didn't want to book a place outside of the city center, and the price was right for this place. Getting to the hotel is pretty easy. Its right on a tram line that you can get on at Centraal Station and hop off a block away from hotel. Otherwise it's a 15-20 min walk to the train station. The inside lobby was nice, and the front desk staff helpful. I had booked a room with a double, but instead we got two singles that you had to push together. Not very impressed with that. The room itself was OK, but the window opened to the busy street below. Not having A/C was somewhat of a draw back as you'd have to open the window which REALLY brought the noise in. The shower was another thing that wasn't the greatest design. The tub was in a weird corner and there were no shower curtains so water went everywhere. We stayed for four nights, but I don't think I'd go back again. The price was too high for what we got. I'd had better experiences in budget hotels/hostels than this. ',POOR,
'Good location, everything else was very poor This hotel is situated in a good central location, but there is nothing about it which is remotely Grand. The reception was well presented but the rooms are very basic and the 'power' shower was appalling and wasn't even good enough to wash properly with. The lift was broken twice during a 3 night stay and the cleaners were very inconsiderate every morning having a chat outside the room early in the morning. The inclusive breakfast was cold and of limited choice but certainly wasn't a full American breakfast, I would recommend eating out if you choose to stay in this hotel. The restaurant staff were generally unhelpful and rude. The TV in the room didn't work and when asking for this to be fixed the staff could not help or offer any solution like an alternative room. The hotel is located in a busy nightlife area and the road is very noisy and busy until the early hours of the morning around 4 am if the window was open the bedroom door rattled constantly. The beds were very soft and not comfortable at all. Generally very disappointing but Amsterdam is a great place to visit. ',POOR,
'loved the albus grand!!!! we stayed here for 3 nights in dec and it was brilliant, great location, very clean and modern and we couldnt of asked for more. .. i was slightly worried afetr what i had read on here. but i really couldnt find a fault with the place. we had a standard modern room with a big bath and television and it was extremely clean and the staff very helpful. if i was to go back again i will def be stayin here!! x ',GOOD,
'Not so Grand Its very central to the Dam Square and the central shopping areas. Very easy to reach from Central Station on the tram. You get off at Muntplein.Hotel is located on a busy road. 3 of us shared one room facing onto the busy road. Not the best for noise and traffic.Overall hotel is very average. Facilities are too dated and for 3 stars we have stayed in better and at better value for money. Breakfast was not included on our package ( we didnt realise) and went for breakfast just 1 of the 2 mornings of our stay. What a mistake!!! Far too expensive at 14 euros each for what it was. You find far better and cheaper outside to eat.The room had stained and burns on carpets and bathroom was very basic.Smoking is permitted in public places and this meant the hotel had a awful smell of cigarettes from the reception area to the hallways of the bedroom floors.Lucky we were only there for 2 nights. ',POOR,
'Not so Grand Good location in basically an old hotel with some cosmetic upgrades.I was lucky to have a room facing the back of the building so I avoided most of the street noise my friends suffered with a room facing the street. Bathrooms were a bit odd - no tub, which is fine, but only a shower curtain to reign in the water so for you splashers out there beware or the entire floor will end up soaked. Also piddly water stream from the shower, it's like taking a shower under a spray can. Good for water conservationists, bad for heavy bathers.Also for the price we paid, breakfast should have been included. But it wasn't. ',POOR,
'Terrific Location While it's certainly not the Krasnapolsky at Dam Square, the Albus Grand proved as a solid home base for my girlfriend and I's 5 day stay in the bustling city of Amsterdam.The rooms were very basic, but adequate. They were small, but not overly small where we felt cramped. Make sure you get a room with a window facing the main street for more lighting. The beds were firm, but comfy. The bathroom was also adequate, but got very wet, which is the norm in Amsterdam. The walls were very thin, but I expect this is a common issue in Amsterdam hotels. Don't expect luxury here, but we weren't t planning on spending much time in our room anyway.The location makes the Albus Grand. It's centrally located. It's a quick 2 minute walk to Rembrandt Square, and a short walk to Dam Sqaure and Leidse Square. The only area tough to access by foot was the Red Light District. A tram stops about a block away and takes you everywhere.The only complaint, and this was minor, is the front desk staff. They lacked professionalism and were not courteous for the most part. They seemed uninterested in making our stay more pleasurable. One attendant said, we don't give anything away for free here. Another, this is only a 3 star hotel, what do you expect? And the lounge downstairs is well decorated, but worthless.All in all, money well spent. Book through the hotel's web site. ',GOOD,
'great location We are a couple aged 19 and stayed at the albus grand hotel for 4 nights. The hotel it self was ok, the rooms were rather small and the rooms were boiling. I would not recomend going here in warm weather. The hotels location was brilliant. It was only a short walk away from dam square. We only had breakfast in the hotel once and it was horrible, i would not recomend this at all. The tram stops just outside the hotel and it costs less that 2euro to get to dam square.Would not recomend eating in the pizza resteraunt next store, but dam square had lovely places to eat. Overall this hotel is great for its location, and if like us all you want is just a place to sleep as we were out most of the time exploring the city, it is ideal ',GOOD,
''Grand deception' about Albus Grand Hotel The only 鈥楪rand鈥?thing about the Albus Grand Hotel was our deception. Breakfast (14 euros) was poor, sheets were not changed. The overall quality of the room and bathroom was much below than what is normally expected from a hotel at this price (there were many burns in the carpet, no bath and the shower was just a hole in the floor of the bathroom). Although stated in the description, there was no wireless internet access in the room. There was a wired access though, alas the staff was unable to state whether it was dial-up or broadband. Finally, when one night there was someone shouting outside and knocking at our window (we were unlucky enough to have been given one of the bedrooms located at the ground floor), the staff said that 鈥榠t is just someone on drugs鈥?and we should go back to our room as they were busy checking in other guests (inputting data into their computer as there was no one in the reception area) ',POOR,
'Loved the Location Great location - just a block from the floating flower market and from Rembrandt Plaza. Plenty of restaurants nearby as well as a grocery, bakery, etc. Hotel breakfast very generous (eggs, bacon, sausage, granola, cheeses, etc). Planning on returning this Fall and staying here again (this is my 6th trip and the only time I have decided to stay at the same hotel). ',GOOD,
'Great Location! Do not expect Luxury at this hotel, the rooms are very basic, though the room was clean and myself and my partner were provided with fresh towels each day, and you cannot beat this hotel for price and location, it is central to all the shops and attractions in Amsterdam.The staff at the hotel were very friendly, though it was a disappointment to find the hotel bar closed early each night and on the last day of my stay with my partner it was not open at all. Though because of the hotel's good location, we were lucky to find plenty of other bar's and restaurants within the area. ',GOOD,
'Great Location (behind the Flower Markets) Great location when we eventually found it!! Hopped onto a tram from Central Station but unfortunately nobody spoke English so we missed our stop, but found after going into one of the shops nearby. When we arrived Sat 10th March and went to check in, the receptionist explained that she did not have a room for us that night but only on Sunday, and we could stay in a 4 star nearby and then come back the following night. Told her not happy about it. So I contacted Hotel Connect (who we made our booking with - fantastic company) to ask what was happening with our booking, she promptly phoned the hotel, we could hear the conversation as we were sat in the lobby - quite funny really. After the receptionist put the phone down she then informed me that they did have a room afterall, but we could not check in after 2pm. ( We arrived @ 11am!!) We went out for a well earned drink and came back and we were actually given a family room on the 7th floor, nice view ( but a very warm room) given that the weather was fab for the duration of our stay. Breakfast was good but staff had a bit of an attitude to be honest. Would I stay there again, yes ',POOR,
'Great location! I returned from a trip tp Amsterdam yesterday having stayed with 5 friends in this hotel. We had a really nice time there and would recommend the hotel to any one travelling to Amsterdam. The staff at the reception desk are very friendly and helpful. A few points to note however, we had booked three non-smoking rooms yet we all ended up in smoking rooms where there was a very strong smell of smoke. There is no safe in the room which I did not like and to leave valuables at reception costs 鈧?.50 a day. Now,a potentially big problem:This hotel accepts stag/hen parties. We were lucky as there was a gang of English guys who did not make a sound and did not wake us but not everyone might be so lucky! When they say breakfast is served until 10.30 at weekends that means you must be in and seated with your breakfast in front of you at that time......don't arrive at the last minute as we did or you'll be turned away(we had gone by the clock on the T.V. in the room which was slow). Some of our gang went for breakfast one morning and felt that it was not particularly good value for what they got and did not go any other day. The hotel in well situated anyway with lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. (Do NOT go to the Italian next to the hotel....poor food, dreadfully slow and an unpleasant whiff from the loos!). The rooms are very hot with no A.C. so be sure to leave the window open during the day to keep the room cool. If you enjoy walking around a city then you will love the location. Although a few minutes south of Dam Square it was not far at all and was quite near the Heineken Brewery so we could walk there too. It is just around the corner from the Flower markets(lots of nice little cafes here, try the first one on the left Amaryllis for breakfast). We really enjoyed our stay and liked the hotel(you also get a complimentary drink from the bar between 5 and 7 p.m. which is a nice gesture). ',POOR,
'Great value and location We got this hotel on recomendation of the tourist board at the airport on the 29th so were a little wary but it turned out to be a lovely hotel.The twin room was small enough but clean and basic. The first night was 105 euro but it shot up over news eve but was still cheaper than a lot of hotels on offer.We were located to the rear of the hotel and there was no tram noise at all.The only down side was no tea or coffee facilites in the room but as I'd heard mixed reviews about so many hotels in Amsterdam it seemed a small price to pay.The staff were helpfull and there is a nice restaurant attached to it.At 15 euro the breakfast isn't worth paying extra for as there are so many nice cafes near by.There are good restaurants in the next street down and plenty of trams going by to take you to the museums etc.All in all a good place to stay in a great city. ',GOOD,
'Nice stay Nice hotel, and good service. Rooms are OK. Shower room is very simple. No shower cabin, but shower is just seperated by curtain from rest of the shower room (toilet, sink etc.)Breakfast was less than I expected. They have the standards (bread, scrambled eggs, bacon etc.), but the quality is not so good.Staff is good and friendly. ',GOOD,
'Albus Grand was Grand Myself and my friend stayed there last weekend, and as said before it is in a great location (after we went around in circles). Staff are very friendly and the rooms very clean and quite big, we were at the front of the hotel on the 4th floor but heard no noise even with the trams outside. Getting around with the trams is excellent. Get a tram outside central station to the hotel as we got ripped off by taxi at 20 euro's!!! Great hotel, good location and lovely staff. ',GOOD,
'well worth it I stayed with my fiancee and 2 friends for 5 nights and thought this hotel was grand. Me and my partner stayed on the ground floor which was quiet and had a balcony, so you could have a smoke or getr some air. I found the room comfortable and the staff friendly. Its a great location beside lots of shopping and restaurants. theres a cheap coffeeshop just round the corner and a lovely tapas bar. If you walk 2mins you get to the tram stop and then its 5 mins into town. Would definitely stay again. ',GOOD,
'great location Two of us stayed one night in the Albus. The location was perfect for us. It is a two minute walk to the flower market and the canal tour, and a few additional minutes to Rembrandt Square for eating and people watching. We walked everywhere and loved the atmosphere. The young, dark-haired man at the reception desk was extremely helpful. He pleasantly gave us information to our questions, and he sent help up to our room when needed.The room was basic and clean. We booked one week prior to arrival and paid 109 euros, or $126.00 U.S. , excluding 5% tax. The price had gone down over the previous days I had checked. The one big drawback was that it was a gorgeous day for sightseeing, but that meant our room on the top floor of the hotel was extremely hot because of the lack of air conditioning . We survived and would go back there again.Upon checking out there was a shuttle bus for 12 euros each heading to the airport. We picked it up across the street. The very efficient front desk arranged for this, and we paid the shuttle bus driver. Smooth and simple.We totally enjoyed Amsterdam. ',GOOD,
'Brilliant hotel, in the middle of everything Booked this with a group of friends as we were travelling over there on a stag weekend. The hotel was pretty quiet over the weekend. We stayed in a deluxe room (which is great because you also get a later checkout time of 2pm). We were in room 215, which becase the hotel is sort of L shaped, we were off the main front road and our window looked out to the back of the hotel. We certainly had no tram noise as noted by other reviewers on here, but the room was notably smaller than the other rooms that other people we were travelling with had. It might be worth asking for a room facing the back if you think it will be a problem.The hotel staff were great all through the weekend. The rooms are clean and spotless (if a little warm - there's no air conditioning in the rooms, so windows have to do). If you want a taxi booking they'll do it, they'll tell you where everything is and the hotel is centrally located so that everything you need is only a maximum 20 minute walk away - and the flower market is only over the road, and there are some great restaurants too. (The italian next door doesnt look like much, but the food is really good).Had a great weekend there and I wouldnt hesitate in recomending the place or staying there again. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Location This is a lovely little hotel in a great location. All the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The room was comfortable and plenty of space for 2 girls, each with a weeks worth of luggage! The only niggle was that the bathroom, although large and very clean, did not have a window or extractor fan and got very very hot. There are loads of nice restaurants and bars in Rembrandtplein and along Reguliersdwarstraat. Particularly liked the Bangkok (Thai) and Roses Cantina (Mexican). Don't miss the half price cocktail hour at the Aussie bar either!The location was great, with all the major sites within walking distance. Try to walk along the canals (gracht) rather than the main streets which can get very noisy and busy. Besides which, it's a much nicer view on the canals.The hotel has an arrangement with a shuttle bus service (Connexions) which will bring you straight from the airport to the hotel for 12 euro each way. You can also book this to go back to the airport on departure (just ask at reception). I found this service really convenient. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic I returned this evening from a 3 night stay in the Albus Grand. On arrival we were upgraded to a superior room at no extra cost. I asked the receptionist why she had upgraded us .. she said she wanted us to have a happy day. That was a great start to a wonderful weekend. We were given room 202. It was beautifully clean, had plenty of toiletries and tea/coffee etc. Beds were extrememely comfortable with crisp white bedding. The only draw back was that it was very noisy coming from the street (no double glazing). However this could be rectified with ear plugs .. no big deal there. Breakfast was good although my friend thought the scrambled eggs far too creamy. After check out we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room at no extra cost. Amsterdam is a lovely city with very laid back people. I look forward to re-visiting and would definitely be staying in this hotel again. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel but very noisy Stayed at the Albus Grand for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. We had a basic room which was very nice , although extremely hot and very noisy. Great location, close to everything. The staff were very friendly  helpful. I would recommend this hotel for location but do not expect to get alot of sleep. If using a taxi to get around ask the hotel to call one for you, its double the price if you get one when out. ',GOOD,

'Very Enjoyable Stay My boyfriend and I stayed in the Albus from the 30thApril - 3rd May this year and I must say we had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is very clean and bright. The check in/out was quick and reception staff were very friendly. Our room was of average size, very clean and bright. Our bathroom had no extractor which was a bit of a pain but apart from that it was fine. We were delighted with the location of this hotel, you could not get a more central location. I couldn't believe how quiet the hotel was seen as it was so central, no noise from the trams or anything.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning on visiting Amsterdam. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Stay Check-in was easy. The room was very clean and spacious-room 701 Triple. The staff was friendly and helpful. Best way to the hotel from Center Station is to take Tram #4 , but you can walk. It's about a 15/20 min walk. The location was excellent!They offer an extended check out until 2:00.The only complaint was the shower water pressure-very weak. ',GOOD,
'Great hotel, great location We stayed 3 nights from 26th - 29th March. We booked the deluxe room, non smoking and with a shower. The room was spacious and we were at the front of the hotel. We did not find it too noisey. Beds were comfortable. We felt 14 euro was a bit much for breakfast and found a lovely cafe facing the flower market and had a good breakfast for 6.50 euro. The hotel is well situated within the city and close to all the major attractions. We would definitely come back to this hotel on our next trip to Amsterdam. ',GOOD,
'Average hotel - great location We stayed four nights at the hotel. We had no breakfast as we thought that paying 14 euro per breakfast was a bit expensive adding 28 euro to our hotel bill. The staff was very polite and helpful.The hotel's location is great. Its near the Rembrandtsplein. Many restaurants are nearby, the flower market, shopping area and its easy to get there by tram or walk (half an hour to the train station without luggage). The rooms are very basically furnished, no bathtub in the standard rooms, but if you are lucky to get a room at the back, its also very quiet unlike the front rooms.I do think that you can find better hotels for the same price range.

'not great at all I always use trip advisor to check hotels before booking and the reviews for this hotel were ok. When we were last in Amsterdam we went in to the reception area and it looked ok and new. I booked this hotel for my parents as it was a present. I was so disappointed when they came back and had so many little but annoying problems. They booked an upgraded room and they said it was ok, the rooms were very noisy from the road outside, the window catch was broken, the room amenities were not toped up. There was nowhere in the hotel to get a drink or anything after the breakfast room shut in the morning. Over all it is not somewhere they would go back to. The room wasn't cheap, the location of the hotel is great but doesn't out way the other down falls, including the unhelpful reception staff. ',POOR,
'Average, nothing special. We stayed in the Albus Grand for 4 nights in Aug 2005. Having stayed in other 3* superior hotels in Amsterdam I was a little let down by this one and I don't think there was anything superior about it.The place is easy to find, just walk down along the flower market to the end and the hotel is opposite the Jolly Carlton Hotel. It's in a great location in that it's very close to the flower market, Dam Sq, Munt Square. You can also get the tram from Central Station and it stops diagonally across from the hotel.The receptionists were nice and friendly and myself and my partner were quickly booked into our room and our two friends into theirs. When we got to the room the first thing we noticed was a balcony! Up on the 6th floor, not much of a view of anything but a balcony all the same. We did much better than our friends who got a supposedly de-luxe room with a view of the wall and a scaffold. I then noticed the blood stains on the walls and I can only guess that these were from the previous guests squashing mosquitoes, disgusting never the less. The walls are even easy to clean but they never bothered. Looked terrible. The beds were clean as was the bathroom. The shower doesn't have a basin, just a plug-hole in the ground so the water covers the whole bathroom floor when you have a shower. This was off-putting because you had to get dressed outside the bathroom so as not to get wet again and when you go to re-enter the bathroom you have to be careful not to slip on the floor.One other thing that really annoyed me about this hotel, especially after reading one reviewers story of having their room robbed, was the fact that if we didn't lock the balcony door, the people in the room next door could enter our room. The balcony was shared with the room next door and so we were extremely careful to lock the door before we went out. But the cleaners didn't really care about us being robbed and so when we'd arrive back from being out for the day the balcony door would be unlocked, open to whoever wanted to come in from next door. The cleaning staff were loud, very loud in the morning and didn't understand 'Do not disturb' signs on the door. They just barged in anyway so be careful to lock your door from the inside. No safe deposit boxes in the room but of course you can rent one at the desk for the pricely sum of 鈧?.50 a night. There is a restaurant downstairs but no room service.I don't think we'd come back here again as it really was just average for the money. There are far better 3* superiors not far away. ',POOR,
'Superb!!! Superb hotel, great location only 10 mins from dam square and 15 from cenral station. Room was good size very clean with modern furnishing. We stayed in room 102 on the ground floor. Hotel is done out lovely with a modern touch, if you want a hotel that is not in dodgy areas of amsterdam this will be for you.The only fault would be our room was not ready till 1.30 hours after check in, but apart from this slight error we will definitely be returning, as the hotel was priced at 205 euros for 3 nights in a standard room via lastminute.Highly Recommended!!!

'If I could change hotel....... WE stay for four night, Great location, However the front desk staff was not very friendly or knowledgable about their wonderful city. THe room we stay in was large and dark, not enough to light to light up the space, so no reading could be none (and we are not over 40) . They had dirty sheets on the bed upon arrival  could not change until the next day.I could go on but I wont. A great location but not a good hotel match for us . I rate this hotel a 2. ',POOR,
'Surprising Booked this hotel as a last resort as every other one was sold out. Did not tell my wife it was a 2 Star hotel. Pros:locationCentral - easy walking distance of the DAM, Redlight District and Amsterdam Central StationRoomsClean, Bathroom a real surprise, I have stayed in 4  5 Star hotels in the UK and Carribbean and this one exceeded them all.StaffFriendly polite - found the Dutch to be extremely helpful, had no use for a phrase book. FoodRestaurant was tendy, only had a coffee and desert, but very stylish and always crowded. Cons:Room facing the street are noisy from passing pedestrain traffic. Some people felt the need to shout all the time. ReccommendationIt's very clean and exceeded my expectations. Staff were good, no room safes, but one could be rented near reception for 2 Euro a day. Get a room at the back of the hotel to escape the noise on the street.Will definitely go back ',GOOD,
'What a little trendy hotel! We found the Albus Grand a highly stylish, modern 3 star hotel, conveniently located in the very heart of Amsterdam, literally steps from Muntplein and virtually around the corner from Rembrandtplein. Mind you, such privileged location also meant our exterior room could get slightly noisy at times despite the double glazed windows! The staff were friendly and helpful, with a good command of English. Our room was spacious and very tastefully decorated, with brand-new furniture, satellite TV and a fancy press iron, but no mini bar, safe or air con though! Luckily, the weather was quite mild during our stay, otherwise we might have found it rather difficult to sleep with the windows open and all the noise outside. The bathroom was also very spacious and well appointed, with free toiletries and a hair dryer.Breakfast was simply delicious, served in a small, trendy restaurant on the ground floor, consisting of all sorts of bread and rolls, hot and cold meats, fruit, yoghurt, tea and coffee. All very nicely prepared and presented. Definitely something to look forward first thing in the morning!All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Albus Grand and would not hesitate to stay at this property again, although next time we would definitely try to get an interior room. ',GOOD,
'Warm welcome in the snow Stayed at the Grand Albus for 3 nights late February. From start to finish the hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The room was good. It is in an excellent area of Amsterdam with nearly all major sites within 15 mins walk. At night it is close to some nice eating places and some good bars. To me it's a good place at a good price in a good area. I'd stay again. ',GOOD,
'Unforgetable stay As we travel all over the world and have seen so many hotels, we really can say this is a hotel to recommend, wonderfull, helpfull staff. very nice, clean rooms and a supurb location !! All sightseeing things are on walking distance and the nightlife starts around the corner. If you want to go for a nice weekend then this is the right address, but also when you are in Amsterdam for business, no doubt you will enjoy this hotel with free internet connection in the rooms. ',GOOD,
'great value and great location I have just spent 3 days at the Grand Albus with 9 members of my family with an age range of 68 to 21. We were all impressed by the hotels excellent rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. The location of the hotel is absolutely ideal with only a short walk to Dam square and most other attractions.The only compaint would be the tiny breakfast room but as this was been refurbished while we were there this problem should soon be solved.Overall a very pleasant hotel and which we will be visiting again. ',GOOD,
'Not bad for the price Stayed here for 2 weeks in November 04. This hotel is very basic and the restaurant only serves breakfast (extra 15 euros! - better to eat outside). The bathroom was below average, a dribbly shower head and one of those non-cubicle showers that soaks the whole bathroom, perhaps explaining the grotty state of the bathroom floor.However, it's not all bad. The location is perfect for both sighseeing and entertainment, just off Rembrandstplein, and walkable to the (better) nightlife off Leidseplein. The bedroom was fine, if basic - well heated, comfortable bed, generally clean. One minor incident - I got back to my room one evening to find a mysterious pair of ladies panties on my bedroom floor (nothing to do with me!). Not sure what this says about security or what the cleaning lady gets up to..I paid 109 Euros per night, which is a very fair price for this hotel. I would stay here again if I'm travelling alone (I'm a business travellor) but would look for somewhere with more charm if travelling in a couple. ',POOR,
'It is good! We would go back! We spend the weekend of 6 and 7 november in Amsterdam, Albus Grand Hotel.The hotel is at a central location in Amsterdam. Only 10 min. walk from station and a few min. away from several musea etc.The staff is friendly and helpfull. The room is clean and good. Breakfast is good. Eggs, bacon, cereal etc... also the staff in the morning is friendly and very quick.We would def. go back to Albus Grand Hotel in Amsterdam! ',GOOD,

'Great locale, delicious breakfast, small room I'm a bit late posting this review, but we enjoyed this hotel. We were there for our honeymoon and would have preferred a larger room and a much larger bathroom. However, the locale was perfect...It was at the end of most of the shopping and right at Wakiki Beach. Lovely, open-air hotel with amazing views, whether beach-side or mountain-side. The pools were spacious and nice. Our favorite part of our stay here was the breakfast. We were still on Atlanta time and woke up around 6:00 am Ohau time! The buffett and spread for breakfast was amazing...the freshest fruits, smoothies, omelet bar, cereals, juices, pasteries...sinful:) erall, this was a great place to stay. ',GOOD,
'OK but could have been better. Had a room on the 17th floor overlooking the beach so view was very good and we had a prime position for the fireworks display on New Year's Eve.The room was OK but we had a lot of noise from neighbouring rooms and also the room above us. The bathroom did not have a seperate shower which I would have expected in a 4 star hotel - in fact the bathroom was very small and shabby. However the toiletries were of good quality and they even left a tube of toothpaste which I though was a nice touch. No shower caps though!We only tried one of the restaurants - the Ciao Mein. This was good but expensive. Portions should be smaller and cheaper.Loved the shops in the hotel and as the Hyatt is very central all amenities are readily to hand.On a general note there are a lot of tramps and prostitutes in Waikiki and this spoiled the area for me. ',POOR,
'Wonderful room For me the large room on the 31st floor with view of the city was wonderful. The restauarant was good and the service fast. The pool area was small for a hotel this size. If I had a car I would have been in panic mode because there is very little parking in this area. The hotel is in walking area of all sorts of shopping and restaurants! ',GOOD,
'Great Value for Money My husband and I spent 4 shopping  sun days in Waikiki recently, and stayed at the Hyatt Regency. Typically we do not stay at chain hotels, but our our travel agent convinced us with an incredible special. $299 a night with breakfast for two, with an ocean view. The room we stayed in was immaculate, modern, and looked as if it had been recently renovated or refurbished. The view was excellent. We only had the buffet breakfasts which were about what you would expect from a large chain hotel. The health club and spa were excellent. Overall I can recommend this hotel, and would go back. ',GOOD,
'Wet but wonderful Uptown from the moment we arrived. Parking is an issue unless you are staying at least 5 nights I think. We were on the 35th floor looking at Wikiki Beach- it was great, rooms are not that big but the bed is very comfy and room has everything you need. There is even a small fridge and a free inroom safe. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet- very yummy. Staff was excellent from time we arrived till we left. We were however unaware of how much Hyatt caters to Japanese as well, all signs are in both English and Japanese and buffet caters to both tastes . This is a very populated area of the island but it does make shopping and getting around easy. The title is because there is no real roof over the Hyatt - it is an open design and we happened to be on the island during lots of rain. Made for walking thru hotel a little wet. ',GOOD,
'It Should Have Been Better Then It Was . . . . We stayed 5 nights at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki during Thanksgiving week. We choose the Hyatt because we鈥檙e Gold Passport members and have found the hotel brand to be consistent over the years with very few unpleasant surprises along with the generally favorable feedback on TripAdvisor. We normally have a room on an upper floor with a king bed, but king beds appear to be few and far between at this hotel, making the upper floors (with a king) difficult to get. We received a room on the 5th floor with advice from the receptionist to check back in the morning to see if an upper floor King room was available. The room was warm when we arrived, but we assumed it was because it had been unoccupied so we just turned the AC on and left to see some sights. When we returned the room temperature was still not comfortable and it got very warm later in the night. I tried to turn the AC on/off to see if it would reset with no luck. I tried to turn the fan from Auto to High and it still didn鈥檛 make an apparent difference. I called the desk the next morning to see if we could get an upper floor and was told there wasn鈥檛 one available so I asked for someone to fix the AC. Maintenance did come to the room quickly, but they told us just to leave the fan on High because the unit wasn鈥檛 very sensitive to room temperature and would cut off on the Auto setting. I told them I had turned it down to 60 with the fan on High and it didn鈥檛 seem to work and they said it wouldn鈥檛 get to 60, but it would cool eventually. The next night was better, but not great. I called the desk again on the 3rd morning of our 5 night stay and there was still no upper floor available so I just gave up. Hyatt鈥檚 response to the issue was 鈥榡ust keep calling back鈥?and that鈥檚 not what I expect from a Hyatt. Normally, they would take care of finding a resolution instead of putting it back on the customer so I鈥檓 disappointed with this location鈥檚 customer service. Other then the AC/customer service issues, the hotel itself is an older property, but the public areas are relatively well maintained and the location across from the beach is good. Since it is an older property, the shower/toilet area is like many from days gone-by when the bathroom door would barely open without hitting the toilet and tub making the area a tight squeeze for one person. The dressing area is bigger and has a large closet so two people can navigate that area without interference. One oddity that I noticed was that the sink/counter height looked like it was designed for the munchkins or something. Since we鈥檙e not short, it was a little awkward, but still functional.I emailed the Hyatt General Manager last week detailing my disappointment with our stay and didn鈥檛 receive a response. I thought he might want to know, but from looking at the TripAdvisor feedback - our problems must not be representative of most guests. It was just unfortunate for us that our milestone anniversary celebration wasn鈥檛 perfect and for this reason, we would select other accommodations if we return to Hawaii. ',POOR,
'great...but... its a beautiful hotel! but it is across the street from the beach!The rooms are nice and the hotel staff are great, they gave us a free oceanview upgrade.This hotel is nonsmoking, however some visitors do not adhere to that rule. so if you are a nonsmoker and sensitive you might want to think again about reserving this hotel.The rooms are noisy because of the doors and they are in very close proximity to the next door room...so you will hear alot of slamming of doors...not on purpose. Its just the way the rooms are.Skip the breakfast buffet nothing special there. ',GOOD,
'Loved it! Booking: Booked on Costco.com. They had a great package for Executive Members. Two free robes, free parking, 2 for breakfastsCheck In: We were given little bottles of Hawaii water upon check in. Saved them and refilled, since the water was good to drink in Hawaii.Concierge: If you have your phone and text messaging, you can sign up to get access to the tex messaging concierge service. The would send texts about events going on in the area, as well as they would give us locations or answer questions while we were away from the hotel. Very prompt! They also have a list of which buses to take to get to different attractions. Oh and they were great at printing up the bus times for going and returning. Parking: We had free parking as our package and that included free valet service. We didn't have rent a car, but when our friend would visit, she utilized our free parking. All they needed was the name and room number.Room: The room was very clean and spacious. We got one on the 39th out 40th floor rooms. The view was a mountain view room, but was very nice. So nice we didn't need to hike up Diamond Head for a view of the city. Also could see the ocean a little. There was a nice long hallway to our bathroom, so it made it feel like plenty of room. Toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, and lotion were replenished everyday. There was also a fridge in the room, which didn't show up as an amenity on the website, so that was a nice surprise! The safe was easy to use and unlike another reviewer, the safe was free. I'm thinking they stayed at a diff. Hyatt, since we didn't have slippers in our room. The patio was spacious with two chairs and a table. Nice place to dry out our suits, even when it was super windy! It was pretty well enclosed, so we didn't have underwear flying away.Pool: The pool is small. We never used it, since we were right across from the beach. They also let you check out towels for the beach.Terrace Breakfast Buffet: It was $26.90 a person, but with our buy one get one free vouchers, it made it okay. They had an omelette bar and crepe bar. Also fresh fruit, smoked salmon, meats, cereal, rice, miso soup, potatoes, crepes, pastries and yummy juice. Oh and Starbucks coffee :) I liked the breakfast we ate at a nearby restaurant better and it was about the same price for two of us. I think it was called Keoki's. ',GOOD,
'Nice place, a mere stone's throw from the beach The hotel is right smack bang in the middle of Waikiki, so you couldn't be closer to the beach. The pick-up service from the airport was friendly and efficient, and all the staff we came across were welcoming.We were fairly high up and had a good view of the sea, and the room as spacious and well appointed. I was a little disappointed with the lack of things such as shampoo, and the fact you were charged for every day you had the in-room safe locked. Use of the slippers incurred a cost, too. For such a good brand, and for the price, little things like that should be standard.The hotel contained many shops, some more appealing than others, and the whole place had a good feel to it. Food was good, especially in the restaurant which provided a fusion of Chinese and Italian cuisine (called 'Ciao Mein', if memory serves). The Japanese restaurant provided decent fayre as well, although the chef did the 'usual' juggling act with spatulas and the like - seems to be common in many Japanese restaurants the world over apart from those actually in Japan(?) .There is a decent pool, and they provide towels for those wishing to pop over the road to the famous beach.All in all, a good place to stay. That being said, I would recommend having a word with the concierge to arrange a hire car for a day or two - a trip away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu to the quieter stretches of beach elsewhere on Oahu island is not a bad idea. ',GOOD,
'Loved the Hyatt Regency Waikiki I could not say enough good things about this resort. We were treated exceptionally well from the time we checked in. Very professional staff. We booked an ocean front room that was actually ocean FRONT (unlike some resorts where you never know what you are going to get). Beautiful 180 degree view from the 36th floor. The elevators are also very quick. It is across the street from the best of Waikiki, and close to all shops and restaurants. If I had to complain about one thing, it would be the parking garage, which is difficult to get in and out of due to its size, but that was a small price to pay for a great 10 day vacation. Much better than the Outrigger or Moana Surfrider that are on the beach. ',GOOD,
'Best location Stayed at the Hyatt in October for 5 nights. Check in was excellent very pleasant. The staff couldn't do enough for you very helpful..Buffet breakfast was fantastic great selection and all staff there were wonderful. Rooms were comfortable, great amenties and a good hairdryer. Also safe in room and a fridge which was great to have. Our room had a nice view. Had a deluxe room we were on the 8th floor. The pool was on the small size but adequate. The location of the hotel was excellent close to everything.The fitness centre had state of the art equipment so if you wanted to do a work out you could. There is no ATM in the building but one directly across the road. I would highly recommend this hotel as being just fantastic. It had everything we wanted. Happy to answer any of your questions. If I was to return to Hawaii I would definetly stay at the Hyatt.Cheers Maggie1111 ',GOOD,
'Good location, service was lacking. We paid for an Ocean View Room but were checked into a partial Ocean View. You had to stick your head out the balcony and look around the corner to see the Ocean. We were moved to a Deluxe Ocean View the next day but had to check out at 11am and they wouldn't let us back in until 3pm that evening. This room had a head on view of the ocean, which is what I expected to receive. Staff were unapologetic.I felt the staff were distant and a little cold. I think that鈥檚 because the hotel is too large and you鈥檙e just another random when you need to interact with them. No personal touches in this hotel. The rooms are fine and comfortable. House keeping was appalling. Everyday we came in the surfaces had not been wiped down, bed throws and pillows were still on the ground. Toiletries were not replaced until we asked for some shower gel. There were only two glasses in the bathroom, nothing for drinking in the room otherwise. Overall, completely insufficient servicing of the rooms on a daily basis.Location is really excellent for all that Waikiki offers.We received a substantial discount on the normal rate when we booked, thankfully. Waikiki, Hawaii and the hotel location is really great. I would not book this hotel again unless getting a substantial discount on the normal rate. ',POOR,
'Gigantic Hotel - but on perfect Waikiki Beach This hotel gives you the feeling that you purchased it as part of a package. In fact, all of Waikiki feels that way. It's like Hawaiian Las Vegas with a beach. First of all, the hotel is gigantic. It takes a few days to just figure out how to get from the street to your room. Lots of wasted and confusing space in the hotel design.The rooms are nice and seem updated and modern with the exception of the bathroom. The vanity is nice and is outside the bath/toilet room...the bath/toilet is small and not updated.The pool is tiny. The hot tub (one) is tiny too. Odd considering how many rooms/guests. Luckily with the beach just across the street we didn't use the pool area. The parking rate is OUTRAGEOUS. I agree with a previous poster that you pay more to park the car than for the rental. Again, I'm guessing most people book this hotel as a week-long package including hotel transfers and don't rent a car.We ate breakfast at the hotel as it was part of the room rate. Large buffet breakfast with something for everyone.The location can't be beat. It's right across from awesome Waikiki beach. An ABC store is in the downstairs and has everything you might need drinks, snacks, necessities, gifts. The hotel is also right in the middle of the shopping and restaurants - all within easy walking distance. ',POOR,
'Nice Hotel!       Fountain in main atrium ',GOOD,
'Hotel was wonderful Well the hotel itself is beautiful, but difficult to navigate. This was our first trip to Hawaii and didn't expect the hotel to have the first floor be all shopping and the check in on the second floor over in a corner that was hard to get to with kids and bags. Also the hotel was supposed to have a car at the airport to pick us up, but messed up and we had to take a cab. HOWEVER, when we arrived at the hotel and our room wasn't ready (we were early) the guest services manager met us and comped us lunch in their wonderful patio restaurant. Also she paid for our cab ride, which was above and beyond what we expected. Our room was wonderful with a phenomenal view of Waikiki Beach and the setting sun. We were all in heaven. The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was small. We only stayed one night because we were catching a cruise the next day. This hotel caters to lots of Japanese tourists who have priority at check in. Also this hotel sits in a perfect spot for all the shopping that is famous in Honolulu. Great for families with teens and groups. ',GOOD,
'great great hotel My husband and I LOVED this hotel overall. I will list why we loved it and some things we didn't like. We liked it because...1. It's in the heart of everything. Right across the street is the Waikiki beach. It's also on the road with all the shops and street entertainment. You won't be bored. On the other hand, if you're in your room or in the hotel outdoor pool area, you won't hear much street noise.2. People are super helpful and nice. We told the front desk that we were on our special anniv. trip and asked if they can give us an upgrade and we got it! Floor 27, beautiful view of the beach... awesome. Also the concierge is really helpful. Specifically Jim (I think that's his name--a japanese gentleman with glasses...) was SO helpful. He also gave us tips on local restaurants that are known for good food that are not touristy. 3. Beautiful! The lobby is open air and gorgeous. The rooms (I got a corner room which is bigger) are beautiful. Nice decor, flat screen tv, clean. The 3rd floor pool/bar area is really nice. It's super clean and they really take care of you. You can rent out towels which they will lay on the chairs for you and you can just lay there and relax after a day full of activities with a book and a drink. They also let you borrow towels and chairs for the beach outside the hotel, which is nice. We also took advantage of the indoor workout area which is great but i wasn't on vacation to work out so i only did it once. it's there if u want it tho. :) We didn't like it because...1. We rented a car (which i totally recommend bc we spent half the time up in the north shore of the island which is about 1-1.5 hrs drive) and the parking cost us just as much as renting the car. I think it was 20-25 bucks a day. and to park is a hassle because the lot is really small and squeezed so after a long day of doing stuff, you don't wanna get your car out to go out for dinner again. 2. They charge money on local phone calls! It's a buck for a call. We didn't know and were making calls to restaurants to make reservations and such and turns out we were charged a buck for each call. If you're from the mainland, just use your cell phone. 3. Internet costs. They also charge $$ for wireless internet. But that turned out OK bc it made us not think about our life back at home and just enjoy our trip. :)Some other things we loved about honolulu:Good asian food! There was a Thai restaurant 5 minute drive away from the hotel called Puckett Thai (sp??). Excellent!!! This is one of those places tourists won't know about. Seoul Jung 2 minute walk away had excellent korean bbq. Alan Wongs was 5 minute drive away. Really expensive but if you wanna end your last night with a great dinner, this is the place to go. You'll spend between 60-100 bucks per person but it's well worth it and i'm not even that rich! Dukes is right on the waikiki beach and we had dinner our first night there. Great food and ambiance. ABC convenient store had really good japanese pastries and their to go japanese noodles and rolls weren't that bad either! Mr. Musubi (spam+rice+egg wrapped with seaweed) was actually really good too. if you're on the go, i'd totally recommend it. Keonis is a thai restaurant just around the corner from the hotel but they serve good and cheap breakfast. Pancakes are really good there.Good activities! We went surfing at the Fire Hawaii surfing school. They are firefighters who are really great teachers. I am NOT athletic mid 20s female and I got to stand up and ride the wave for about 30 seconds! it was exhilarating. Definitely worth it cuz when are you going to surf if not here?? We went Snorkeling at Hanauma bay. The water feels kind of hazy at first but if you go out a bit more, even tho it's not that deep, you'll see LOTS of fish. It was GREAT. Northshore beach-we went to Waimea bay or something like that. There's limited parking but if you get a spot, it's SO spacious and clean there. we went back multiple times to come here. We even saw sea turtles here!!! Diamond head was nice. I'd hike it if you haven't done that yet. ',GOOD,

'very nice place, and a good deal if done through Priceline We stayed here in early Oct 2008, and were pleased to have received a good deal ($129/night) through Priceline. The hotel was everything you would expect from a high quality Hyatt, with attentive service and helpful staff. One downside is that there is no free wireless internet, which is the paradox of the most expensive hotels. Hyatt has furnished their rooms excellently, and everything was comfortable and flawless throughout. The hotel has beautiful grounds and shopping areas, and easy access to the beach, ABC stores for food, snacks, etc, and lots of restaurants all over the place. One important tip for others staying here, if you're interested in avoiding the incredible $25/day parking charge, simply drive half a block over to the Pacific Monarch hotel, where you can park in their garage any time in/out for $12/day. Or even better, go over to Ala Wai Blvd for free parking after a little bit of a search if you're storing the car for more than 12 hours. enjoy! ',GOOD,

'Great Hotel in a great location! I really loved this hotel. It was in a great location, walking distance from the beach- 2 min and good rooms.We got this room on Hotwire for $229 which I thought was a great deal for a 4 star hotel. We got upgraded to partial-ocean view room and a got a disables room which worked great for us since the bathroom and the room was huge! My only compliant was the double beds were too small, I guess they were full size.The hotel is big and you can get lost at times, the entire hotel seems popular to a lot of Japanese tourists.They have the trolley and bus that stop right across the street. Overall great value! ',GOOD,
'excellent hotel The Hyatt Regency Waikiki was just about perfect. Had an Ocean Front room on the 28th floor. Daily breakfast buffet was included. The room was large and nicely furnished, 32 flat screen TV was a nice touch. Housekeeping was efficient and everyone we came in contact with pleasant. We ate at the buffet daily, (naturally). It was excellent, the regular basics plus a few different items each day. Also ate at the Seafood Village, (2 times). Dinner specials are excellent, service impecable. There are two ABC stores in the building that are like small supermarkets. All kinds of other upscale shops as well. Location was perfect, if we return to Honolulu we'll stay at the Hyatt for sure.

'Clean and Comfortable But Noisy Street Traffic I decided to stay at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki after admiring it during the last ten trips to Oahu. The Super Sunshine Free Breakfast Partial Ocean View and 3rd Night Free was the best vacation deal. I also picked the hotel because the room was larger than many of the surrounding hotels. The d茅cor is basic and the room was soundproofed. It was nice keeping the lanai doors open throughout the day and evening. The only drawbacks were the noisy street traffic despite Kalakaua being a one-way street and an untalented street performer drummer who would not quit until 1:30AM. I discovered a Laundromat on-site but the maintenance department should service the dryers. There is also a medical office on-site. The hotel employees are friendly and courteous. The next time that I stay at this hotel, I will pick a room with a mountain view which should be on the side street with less traffic noise. ',GOOD,

'Superb Hotel Superb accommodations in the Ewa Tower and the staff and others (Expedia.com desk and Budget Rent-A-Car) couldn't have been nicer. The hotel is as gorgeous now as it was 23 years ago when we were there on our honeymoon, with a beautiful open and airy three-floor lobby with plenty of shops.I mentioned that this was our first time back since then and the General Manager, David Lewin, sent a bottle of champagne to our room. Classy!Other notes: We booked a package through US Airways so the room was cheaper than had we booked it a la carte. It also included free breakfast, which is an impressive buffet with freshly-made omelets and waffles. Find a package that includes breakfast as it'll set you back $25 per person if you don't. With four of us over four days that was $400 saved right there.Worth mentioning, but not a deal-breaker: The bathrooms, while clean and in fine working order, could use some upgrading--they look a bit old. Also, at a hotel of this caliber and price, free wi-fi should be part of the deal. Right now it's $10 for 24 hours. The hotel business center was also a pay service, so it could cost you $5-10 to print something like boarding passes so you don't have to deal with doing it at the airport. I've stayed at cheaper hotels where this was a freebie, so there's no excuse why a high-end place like the Hyatt Regency can't do it too.But again, that's small potatoes in comparison with the beauty of this hotel and the professionalism of the staff. I'd gladly recommend it to anyone and wouldn't hesitiate to go back there myself. ',GOOD,
'Exactly what you need in Waikiki! First let me say that I have stayed at the Four Seasons in the US and abroad as well as at $10/night hotels in SE Asia and this really met all of my expectations. Not super fancy, not a dive, good value for my dollar. This is Waikiki after all so yes, it's noisy at night, yes, there are expensive restaurants and lots of people. If you want a different experience, stay at Turtle Bay on the North Shore or head to another island.I got a $192/night rate on Orbitz for an Ocean Front Deluxe and ended up in room 2761 in the Diamond Head tower. Tried to check in at 1pm, but the room was not ready. Came back at 3pm as advised and we were set. They did try to put us in an Ocean VIEW (rather than Ocean Front which is a nicer category) room, but when I pointed it out, they made a speedy change.The hotel is in a great location 20 steps from the beach and our room was nice and large with a spectacular view. It had a large side chair/ottoman, desk and chair, flat screen, dresser, separate dressing  bathroom area. The pool is tiny, but the lounge chairs are very comfy and if you want to be in the water, the beach is 20 steps away. Service was excellent and for the price we paid, it was a bargain.I also really liked that when you called or spoke to the concierge about doing an activity, they gave you all the options including how to take a bus ($2) to get somewhere vs. pushing you into one of the tours.PROS: Big room, great view, good price, they loan you sand chairs and beach towels to take to the beach for free, car rental on site, laundry on site if you need it, live music at the pool/bar in the evening, and right in the heart of everything WaikikiCONS: Restaurants in the hotel are only so so and kind of pricey (but lots of things in walking difference that are better/cheaper), the door has a big gap underneath so lets in light from the hall, the non-smoking rooms allow smoking on the decks so if you have your door open or are outside it smells when others smoke. The bed is not super comfy, but the linens are great. ',GOOD,
'Liked it a lot! I'm a huge Marriott fan, but I went off course this time and picked the Hyatt over the Marriott in Waikiki. The pricing was similar, but the Hyatt was offering free parking since we booked through Cosco Travel. Although the Marriott looked nice enough from the exterior, they Hyatt's location can't be beat.. Our room was large and clean. It could probably stand some updating, but with the gorgeous ocean and sunset views, who really cares what the bathroom  dressing area look like?!We had wine each night on our lanai, while watching the nightlife below (and fireworks on Monday  Friday nights). The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the daily breakfast buffet was nicely vaired each day so we never got tired of the food.Although we're probably getting a bit too old for all of the action of Waikiki, if we ever return, we will definitely choose the Hyatt again. Our vacation was lovely. Thanks, Hyatt! ',GOOD,
'Exceptional We stayed here for the first 8 days of our honeymoon.It was quite simply gorgeous.Great location, right accross the street from waikiki beach.The staff were superb, and the room was extremely spacious with superb view. ',GOOD,
'Great Service, Free Hurricane This was a Priceline last minute special, so I wouldn't feel right about posting a bad review. Fortunately, I don't have to.This was our first visit to Waikiki (we'd been to Big Island in 07), and though we're from LA, we weren't quite prepared for the intensity of the area, the huge numbers of people crammed into a small space, etc. Some people sniff at Waikiki, tawdry, plastic, etc., so our expectations weren't that high. Pleasant surprise: didn't see tawdry. Did see upscale chain stores and restaurants, all familiar from malls across America. Also many more reasonable and original places to shop and eat.Did not eat in the Hyatt, so can't rate their restaurants.Everyone was friendly and efficient, especially Michael, the parking kahuna. Everything near-new and scrupulously clean. Patrons at least 50% Japanese, mostly in families. Pool and spa too small and hopelessly crowded, essentially unusable.Room: we were [gratis] bumped up to a mountain-view room on the 25th floor; loved the view, and room was fine, but within five minutes became aware of banshee-howling winds, winds that sounded like a blizzard on the Montana prairie, I'm talking screaming winds. We tinkered with the lanai sliding door, no luck, called the desk.Extremely polite repair person showed up within minutes. While the Hyatt's octagonal design is in part at fault for the wind-tunnel effect, there was a problem w the door. Repair guy added weatherstripping, pounded, hammered, etc., really threw himself into his job. Later we heard him buzzing and drilling in the unit just upstairs from us. The hurricane stopped, but design flaws continued to be apparent, in the form of drafts and flows of air in and out of the room at all times. Put a towel under the door to help control this.That's most of what I can say about the place. The lobby is huge, 3-story waterfall as advertised, three levels of shops almost entirely uninhabited almost all the time. How do they stay in business?? Very overpriced goods, all available at 1/3 the price down the street. Escalators to and from the lobby were confusing at first, but we learned the pattern. The Hyatt is indeed across the street from Waikiki Beach Central, canoe rides and all, but it doesn't have a beachy feel. We wandered through the Sheraton across the street and that empties onto the sand -- far superior -- far higher price, too.We were out of the room most of the day, and ate out with friends 3 nights out of 4, so Waikiki Beach itself remains something of an abstraction to me. Swam at Kailua -- or rather, got battered, but no harm done -- and at Waimea on the North Shore. Loved the North Shore, by the way: gorgeous, friendly, much more like Hawaii as we mainlanders like to imagine it.Saw the Brothers Cazimero at Chai's Island Bistro on Wed., 7/23. They were incredible: just stood there three feet away, opened their mouths, and that music came out. Robert left early (he had a plane to catch) but Roland hung around and shmoozed with customers and generally acted like an ordinary mortal, at home in the middle of the sea. I loved it.The food at Chai's, however -- there was way too much of it. We ordered the prix fixe and were full by the end of the appetizer course ... yet it kept coming, like another wave over already seasick passengers. I don't want to look at a coconut shrimp and Thai peanut sauce for a year -- and I generally love those things.Last word on the Hyatt: if you get it on Priceline, as we did, take it. You'll have the luxury feel and top-quality service. If you can afford to pick and choose, the grande-dame Sheraton is actually on the sand (as are several other hotels, of course, but this is the one we saw) and has triple the ambience nd aloha feel.I just have to add: if you're on Oahu, see Pearl Harbor. I won't get into that now, except to say that watching 67-year-old blobs of oil float from under the sunken USS Arizona ... like the souls of the deceased ... I remembered that for all its exoticism and enchantment, Hawaii is still America, and Americans gave their lives in this place. Not to be forgotten.sw ',GOOD,
'Exceptional Hotel Our family stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 12 days in June 2008. We cannot say enough about this hotel! We booked a Deluxe Oceanview with double beds. Since we are Hyatt Platinum members, we were given the opportunity to upgrade to the club level. After inspecting the upgrade, we decided to stay in the room we originally booked because of its spaciousness. The breakfast buffet was unbelievable! What a way to begin your day on the terrace overlooking Waikiki Beach! Our daily server even gave our children (7 and 10) hula lessons!  We cannot wait to visit the Hyatt Regency Waikiki in the VERY near future! ',GOOD,
'Hyatt hub of activity Just returned from 3 nights at the Hyatt en route back to the East coast from a Western Pacific islands buisness trip. Although I had been to Honolulu previously, this was my first stay at this property. The Hyatt is located in the center of Waikiki and is walking distance to many restaurants and all of the shopping (except the Ala Moana Center). My room was next to the elevator and somewhat subjected to a lot of noise as guests came and went. As other reviews mentioned, the accomodations are comfortable with the bathrooms needing renovation. My primary complaint was with the pool area located on the third floor overlooking the beach. While it could be a pleasant place it was overrun with children both in the pool and hot tubs. Despite signs saying 12 and over for the hot tubs, there were numerous unattended young children using the hot tubs as a playground. When I mentioned this at checkout, there was little concern or response. So if you desire peace and quiet, I would suggest a more adult oriented property (i.e., Moana Surfrider). ',POOR,
'Had A Great Time! My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for our 10 year anniversary and we had a great time. The room was a Deluxe Ocean View on the 28th floor. Our lanai had a great view overlooking Waikiki Beach. The room itself was nice, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nothing special but it served it's purpose.Included in our stay was the breakfast buffet. This is one of the few negatives that I have to say about our stay at the Hyatt. We were not really impressed at all with the food and if we would have paid $20 per person for that we would have been greatly disappointed. We did not try any of the other restaurants at the hotel.The pool was nice but pretty small considering how large the hotel is. They give you fresh towels with each trip to the pool and will even give you chairs to take across the street to the beach. Barbara, the waitress at the pool, was awesome. She remembered us after day one and kept the drinks coming!The location was great. Directly across the street from the beach and just a block or two away from great restaurants and shopping. The police station is right across the street from the hotel so do not be worried about anything you may have heard about the crime. We did not see or hear of any!The concierge was also very helpful in getting us a different flight back to the mainland. There are ABC stores everywhere in case you need to pick up an item you forgot, anything you may need to snack on or those little trinkets to take home.I would be confident in recommending this hotel to friends and family and would definitely stay there again.One last thing, check-in is on the 2nd floor...go up the escalator or elevator one floor when you get there. ',GOOD,
'Japanese oriented hotel but everyone can enjoy :) We stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon, which was spilited between Honolulu and Maui. At time of checking we found out our room is not ready and when we got it we found it the room has double queen bed with half city half ocean view, which was against our wish. When we complain they offered us free parking ( $20 pn ) for our stay and they promised to move us to the first available ocean view king bedroom. So we stayed in 2 different rooms each with different amenities and views and I should say both rooms were great. Very big and comfy...the best thing was the gorgeous view of ocean and city light at night. To be honest we liked half ocean half city view better! This hotel is located right cross the beach so it is like you almost got your own private beach! There are many restaurants, shops and boutiques in the lobby and they are all very Japanese oriented!!! One thing that was obvious is the fact that Honolulu has many Japanese residents and tourists and if you appreciate the culture ,Hyatt Regency is the best hotel for you. They even offer Japanese style of breakfast along with many other excellent food for daily breakfast buffet. Over all happy and book again ',GOOD,
'Loved the Hyatt We stayed at the Hyatt in October of 07 and loved it. The service from check in to the breakfast buffet to the pool area was impeccable. We especially have to give kudos to Barbara and Paws at the pool. By the 2nd day they knew we would order a lava flow and were very friendly. We researched the rooms and knew we wanted a great ocean view so we opted for the deluxe ocean view and got the view we were seeking. The room was great and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was the only negative and there was nothing wrong with it but it was just an average bathroom and we were expecting a bit more but no deal killer...it's just a bathroom. Our room included a free breakfast buffet and it was excellent. Generally we are hotel hoppers because we enjoy trying new places but if we can get as good of a price as we did last time we will definately stay at the Hyatt again. The location is excellent, service is excellent, and we just had an excellent stay! ',GOOD,
'Will never stay in this hotel again Considering the price and the so-called reputation of this world wide hotel we were dissapointed with this one. The hotel is not on the beach, You have to cross the street to a public beach always crowded, even homeless people, its dirty. Do not be fooled by the pictures of the pool in the hotel. The pool is just like a kiddie pool. Considering the size of the hotel, two large towers, it is simply ridiculious. The hotel itself is more like a mall. You have to carry your bags to the second floor to check in, and access the elevators. It was clearly designed to attract shoppers, because as guests you are forced to go around and around to access the elevators and the escalators. We paid for ocean view room, and their ocean view means going out to the corner of the balcony and see a glimpse of the ocean. We took our lap top with us, only to find out we had no wifi access in the room, we had to go to the corporate center to access the internet, at additional cost. On top of that we had to pay extra to be able to lock the laptop in the room. The only good thing about our stay was the breakfast. The hawaiian chef making the omelettes was great, the food and the variety were great. Other than that I do not recommed this hotel. Their advertisement, and all the nice pictures in their ads are misleading to the customers. ',POOR,
'Good Location The hotel is a huge property  has a nice lobby area with a waterfall. The location is really good because it is right across Waikiki beach and foot steps away from all the amazing shopping (which there is a ton of from the Ala Moana mall to the International Mkt- located just footsteps from the hotel for buying souviners  trinkets). The rooms are standard and no big deal, same goes for the bathrooms. We were on our honeymoon, so the rooms weren't what we expected at first so we asked to change it so we can have a nice view of the ocean. The staff is very friendly which is always important and they were always willing to help us with anything we needed.  For the food, room service food sucks, but the breakfast buffet is pretty good and you can have breakfast with a beautiful view of the beach. As for dinner, we always went out so no comments on the restaurants located inside the hotel, other than it seemed like they were never really busy. In general, if I ever come back to Oahu, I would probably stay at the Hyatt again. Especially from looking at the other properties in the area, it seemed the Hyatt was the best one. Oahu (Waikiki area) is very alive and croweded so if you like quiet and non-commercial areas, Waikiki is not your place. ',POOR,
'great staff, hotel and location There are only 2 negatives in this review and both happended right at the start.we arrived at around 11:30am , too early to check in. They gave me a pager and said it would go off when the room was ready, or to come back at 3pm. So we waited and waited around, coming in San francisco clothes into te heat of Hawaii, well it seemed like a long time. At 2:45pm I went back and it seems the room had been ready for ages. Anyhow we got to our room which was lovely, a king as requested, spacious with a working (and empty) Fridge, and everything you could ask for. We flaked out for a while and after about 20mins I noticed that planes seems to be flying over every min or so, that cant be right we aren't on the flight path. Evntually I realised we were right beside the elvator shaft and we were hearing the elevator goin up and down all the time, what a noise ! I guess I coulda asked to move, but they generally quiten down around midnight and so we decided to stay put. (room was 1651 btw)Everythng else about this hotel was great. Staff were extremely friendly, pool area, was really well staffed. The pool itself is very small, but you are well looked after by the staff. Room service food was fine, and both the food and the drinks at the bar/pool were quite reasonably priced given the quality of the hotel.Location is literally right across the road from the beach. ',GOOD,
'The Hyatt was outstanding First of all, thank you to everyone who has submitted reviews on Tripadvisor. These really helped me plan what was an amazing holiday in Hawaii (I returned only a few days ago).I stayed at four hotels during my stay, so I will review the other ones separately on the website (being Westin Moana Surfrider Waikiki, Four Seasons Resort Maui and Westin Resort Maui).I was extremely impressed by the Hyatt Regency. It was in a great location across the road from the beach, in the centre of activity, and offered superior hotel facilities. From my perspective, it was probably the best place to stay in Waikiki if you wanted that 5 star hotel feel as it was the largest hotel there, featured an impressive lobby and interior, nice guest rooms (all of which had balconies/lanais) and had a range of restaurants, high-end retail shopping and many other facilities (even a doctor's surgery which I found surprising).I booked a Deluxe Ocean view room to ensure I had a good view of the beach (I had read several reviews to indicate that Partial Ocean view rooms in hotels generally provided views of buildings or mountains, with just a speck of water!). My other room specifications were for a room in the Diamond Tower, as suggested by other reviewers (I think due to views down the beach towards the main area of Waikiki) and a room higher in the hotel to avoid any street noise. The hotel offered me the exact type of room I wanted which demonstrated their high level of customer service from the beginning.In fact, in other reviews I had read some people mentioned about good or bad customer service at hotels generally, which I hadn't previously perceived as important, but I was given such good treatment at the Hyatt I realised how much I appreciated this. I was quite surprised at how friendly and helpful the staff were.In terms of the restaurants, I only went to the Terrace Grille for the breakfast buffet, which was excellent. Again, the staff were very attentive. The restaurant was open-air and overlooked the beach, so it was a nice way to start the day. There were also other restaurants in the hotel which looked nice (including an award-winning restaurant).All in all, my stay at the Hyatt was excellent and I will be keen to book there again when I return to Hawaii (hopefully soon). ',GOOD,
'Fun Fun Fun Location, Location, Location - the beach is directly across the street. Large and accommodating. The beach offers rentals of any and all water toys. Catamaran tours are also waiting for you to enjoy. The Hyatt offers a grill right there on the beach. The Trolly pick up is right outside the hotel. This is very convenient. The hotel has a lot of upscale shopping in the mall. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful place.... Nice honeymoon My Husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 10 nights in April for our honeymoon. The hotel is very nice, and the location is perfect! It is right across the street from Waikiki beach, and within walking distance to a lot of things! Breakfest buffet- Is a good size, and has a variety of fruits, muffins, pastries, eggs, bacon, cereal. Enough to get your day started. Hotel- Rooms are nice, good size and really comfortable beds. The bathrooms are outdated, but who cares. Beach- Waikiki beach is really nice, water in some parts have high waves, but they have sections blocked with barriers where the water is calm. The staff at the hotel ranged. Some where really nice, and some where not! We informed them we were on our honeymoon, and they suggested we pay an addition $150/night for an ocean view room. When we told the front desk we were not interested, she was some what insulted! The view didn't matter to us as we didn't spend to much time in the room, and the view of the mountains that we had was beautiful- especially in the morning when the sun came up. Sunrise over the mountains, was breathtaking! The expedia desk was very helpful in booking your excursions, we went on: Ocean voyage (dolphins, sea turtles, and whale sightings) you also snorkle on this one. Pearl Harbor, Germaines Luau, Circle Island tour, Diamond Head crater, Monoa Falls rainforest hike, honolulu zoo is within walking distance from the hotel. Overall our honeymoon was excellent! Honolulu/Waikiki is worth every penny is cost to get there, and every sent it cost to eat. ',GOOD,
'Regency Club Worth Every Penny We had a wonderful time at this hotel. PROS: The staff was so accomodating it was ridiculous. On check in they upgraded our Mountain View deluxe room to a room on a Regency Club floor (34 - 40 I believe). This meant that the Regency Club room on the 39th floor was open to us as was a nice spread for breakfast and cocktails, drinks and appetizers in the evening. Our bed was turned down and chocolates left behind each night. The view from the room was beautiful although an ocean view would have been nice. The location was good as well, Cross the street and you are on the beach; it's maybe fifty foot from the hotel wall to the sand. All the high-end shopping you could want and good restaurants are to the right as you face the beach. A block inland brings moderate priced American fare.Almost forgot - They put out tangerines by the elevator every afternoon!CONS: Waikiki is loud and bright. If you are looking to relax, the hotel is nice, but it's very noisy on the balconies and on the street. If you really want relaxing location don't come to Waikiki. Paying for parking is the only thning I can really complain about, although this is standard for most hotels, especially in a city. ',GOOD,
'Fabulous We stayed between April 21 - 28. Everyone was so so courteous and always referred to us by our names. The pool was a bit small but it was good enough for my 9 month old baby. It has a great view of waikiki beach. There are rocking chairs for you to just sit and enjoy the view. The room does not have a mini bar anymore but the refridgerator is still there so you can stock up on your own booze. We did valet parking because the parking garage was across the street not far but i rather pay the extra $5 for someone to bring my car to me. There are in and out priveleges. Also keep in mind that there is no parking in waikiki. The only down side of the hotel room was the washroom. It needs some updating to match the rest of the hotel. Can't wait to go back next year! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic (If you dont need an internet connection) Overall, absolutely 1st class. The only gripe I had was the internet connection being absolutely 3rd world! In their defence, we were upgraded to the Regency suite and given use of a limousine, free cocktails between 5pm and 8pm AND free breakfast.I trade on the UK markets, so I was still upset as this is classed as a 4* hotel, but, to their credit, they did try and do everything that was in their power to sort it out.Overall, fantastic stay and I would definitely go back (if I dont need an internet connection). ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel in Waikiki This is my second time at this hotel and it is THE BEST in Waikiki !!!!! Both of my stays were in March of 2008 and included my wife and I and our two sons. Our first stay was in a deluxe ocean view room that looked over the outdoor dining area and the swimming pool. This was a very nice room because it had views of the ocean and the Waikiki strip. The added bonus was the Hyatt plays Hawaiian music in the pool area and we could always hear the music from our room balcony and we loved that. When you go, remember to ask for your free-use beach chair at the pool cabana before you head down to the beach. The onsite ABC stores can provide you with anything else you need day or night.For our second trip to Waikiki, we booked our room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village just to try a different hotel. The property was nice, but the staff were so rude it spoiled it. So after only one day, we missed the EXTREMELY nice staff at the Hyatt so much that we cancelled the rest of our reservation at the Hilton and moved to the Hyatt. After we got moved to the Hyatt, our room was a deluxe ocean view room on the diamond head side of the tower. The view from this room was absolutely fantastic! We were again greeted by the wonderful staff at the Hyatt and our fun time in Hawaii was back on track!So, after two trips to Waikiki, I can tell you that the Hyatt is the only place to say. My hat is off to the management at this property, because the staff go out of their way to make sure you have an excellent visit to Hawaii. ',GOOD,
'This was my favourite! I ended up here purely by default as the travel company had overbooked my stay at another hotel. The Hyatt could offer 3 nights out of 6 but that was enough to make me fall in love with the hotel. I can't fault it one bit. It was clean, comfortable, friendly and in a great location. What more could anybody want. Ok it's a bit on the expensive side and there are lots of other cheaper alternatives just a stones throw away from the beach, but if you fancy a bit of luxury then I'd go for this hotel. I'm hoping to come back here for another stay one day. ',GOOD,
'great location Received free up-grade when I arrived to a club room. I am very glad I did not request this room from the beginning- although I had a great view! the room was just average (although a bit above average for Waikiki) the price for what you get is extreme. It was a large room with two double beds, btw double beds are only slightly larger than twins, the bathroom was very 3 star-tops. The club floors offered a lounge where they provided minimal snacks and drinks- they provide a bartender. Not quite like the free range at a Sheraton club lounge. The breakfast buffet was- ok to good. They do have a guy (great guy) that makes omelets, eggs and waffles. One word of caution, the valet is s-l-o-w. I did manage to have an issue of misplaced keys which caused an hour delay in them retrieving my car. Positives- great location right beside market place and across from beach. Quick and efficient check-in/outWould I stay again, no... ',GOOD,
'Absolutely LOVE the Hyatt Regency Waikiki!! I just came back from Hawaii (Honolulu) and we stayed at the Hyatt Regency. It is an absolutely beautiful hotel and in the best location. It literally takes about 30 seconds to walk from the hotel lobby to the famous Waikiki beach. The rooms are comfortable (albeit the view was not great...overlooked rooftops and a parking lot), and the cleaning staff is very nice. Actually, the entire hotel staff was welcoming and helpful. Inside the hotel, there is an Expedia tours, Hertz, and Budget car rental stations where you can go to book same-day tours or rent cars, etc. which is very convenient. They have an amazing spa that overlooks the beach and ocean. We took hula dancing lessons in the spa ($20 per person and is offered on Tues/Thur/Sat) and had a wonderful time. I love this hotel...no doubt I shall stay again!!In terms of tours, we booked the following excursions:1. Pearl Harbor: booked through the Home of the Brave Tours and not only did we visit the USS Arizona memorial, we also toured the Home of the Brave Museum which has a nice selection of WWII memorabilia. The tour guide (Kelly) was professional, friendly, and very informative2. Horse-back riding at Kualoa Ranch: amazing experience; the horses were mild-mannered and well-trained. The view overlooking the ocean, lush trees and Chinaman's Hat was amazing. The staff is super, super friendly!3. Hanuama Bay: definitely should visit as the water is as clear as can be and there are lots of fish to see if in the deeper part of the ocean4. Germaine's Luau: highly recommended; the tour guide (Georgie) was professional and hilariously entertaining. The show was not very long but the quality was good. This was also the most reasonably priced (less than $100 unlike other ones that are available). It is large (~500 people) but did not feel out of control...it was like having a backyard party...with 500 of your closest friends...sort of! ',GOOD,
'Dazed  If you want to be in the center of Waikiki action and across the street from the beach, you can't pick a better spot. than the Hyatt to lay your head at night. But be prepared for a high-rise hotel that's basically built on top of a shopping mall. There are scores of shops on the first three levels, and you have to navigate your way through a maze to reach the room elevators. Other than the constant need to get your bearings, the hotel has everything you need when you'r e not enjoying the incredible variety of Waikiki shopping and dining options.  Rooms were recently renovated in a low-key style and rather non-descript decore. Beds are plush but batherooms are cramped and still somewhat dated. Spa is top notch, and restaurants are good but not great, partcularly given the high tarrifs charged. Pool is intimate (read: small) but comfy chaises and attentive service compensate--and don't forget the beach is right across the street.If you want big, sprawling and convenient, this hotel is highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'Overall good hotel Recently stayed here for a few days while visiting my godparents in Honolulu. I chose this hotel primarily due to its location (across the street from the beach, only 4 blocks from my godparents' condo building). Overall, my husband and I were pleased with our stay. The room (in the Diamond Tower) was large  spacious. It was also comfortably furnished; the bed to us was very comfortable, and there was a refrigerator and a nice flat screen TV in the room. The bathroom was not luxurious but was adequate. The maid service during our stay was excellent. Desk staff was friendly. Parking is expensive ($20/day self park, more for valet parking). The location of this hotel is excellent, being within easy walking distance of the beach, shopping,  restaurants. The hotel also provides free shuttle service to any locations within a 5 mile radius. It is very large, so someone looking for personalized boutique service will not find it here. However, my husband  I were both pleased and agreed that we will stay here again when we come back to visit my godparents. ',GOOD,
'Great spot, great service I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency from 2/23-3/2/08 and had a wonderful stay. I went for a conference and roomed with another person and found the room to be very clean and spacious at an affordable rate. I stayed in the EWA tower which is supposedly older than the DiamondhHead, but was fully renovated. I had a partial ocean view/mountain view room which overlooked waikiki beach. I recommend staying high up in the hotel to reduce noise from the street and an overall better view. This hotel is literally across a 2 lane (easy to cross)highway right onto the beach. You can get beach chairs at the pool to take across the street, but make sure you go early because they run out. And if the beach gets old, because it is very small ,the pool is great and the pool chairs are very comfortable. There are 2 hot tubs on the deck of the pool which overlooks the beach and the waitresses are very friendly and accomodating. At night on some nights of the week there is live music by the pool which I didnt care for but it stops at 9:30 which I was grateful for.The concierge and the activities people are very helpful and not pushy at all. This is a great location as it is within walking distance from all the hotspots in downtown Waikiki. It is also right on the bus route to get to DiamondHead which is awesome and a variety of other attractions. We took a Catamaran ride one afternoon at 3pm on the MaiTai Catamaran which was a 90 minute boat ride for 23 dollars. It was well worth it. Totally laid back with a really cool crew mixing cheap drinks with an opportunity to jump in the ocean and take a swim. We saw plenty of humback whales on that ride...no extra charge. On the day we left the hotel was so accomodating for our late flight out. We got a hospitality room to shower and change in and they stored our luggage for the day. No problems and no extra charge. Everyone in the hotel is friendly and helpful. There are tons of places to find cheap food around the hotel within walking distance. A great restaurant on the more expensive side a friend recommended was Nick's Fish Market down Kalakua Ave. it had great food and great service. Overall I was very satisfied and would return without hesitation. I have stayed in Ritz Carlton's and other 5 star hotels and I thought the service here was much better. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel, Great Location! We booked this hotel through Pleasant Hawaiian- which was a TERRIBLE experience and I highly recommend you AVOID the company entirely- but that's another story.Pleasant Hawaiian pulled a bait-and-switch and promised us a room level that they did not deliver. Fortunately, the staff at the Hyatt Regency was SO kind and accommodating that they gave us a complimentary upgrade simply because we asked. The room they offered us as an upgrade was beautiful, with a fantastic view of the ocean.Clearly they have paid attention to some of the negative points people have mentioned previously- they had free coffee, refrigerator, irons, hair dryers, etc. in our room. They had every amenity one would expect, including free valet parking (which is an absolute must in a place like Waikiki!).The hotel is VERY large and definitely not your quiet, romantic getaway on the beach kind of place...but if you enjoy being in the center of everything, just steps away from the beach in a beautiful setting- this is a wonderful hotel!The staff was AMAZING- every single person we dealt with was helpful, professional and very, very kind. The room was clean and comfortable and nicely decorated with every amenity necessary. The location is fantastic- right on the beach, within walking distance to every kind of shop, restaurant and close to everything. The only cons would be that the hotel is very large, the street outside can be noisy at night- but we were so tired, we hardly noticed! And the shops and restaurants on site are predictably expensive (but very good!). Overall, we loved this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to be in the center of everything and doesn't mind the hustle and bustle of the big city! It's no secluded tropical hideaway, but everything you could want or need is right on site! ',GOOD,
'Hawaii ...as it is today. Our travel agent screwed us. We paid her for ocean front delux at another hotel. We were transfered here after she failed to make the reservation. The staff was superb at the Hyatt. They took over where our agent left off. It was our anniversary and they left champagne in our room. And our view..I tell everyone that you know that photo you always see of Hawaii ..the one with diamond head and the beach..well it must have been taken from our room #3063. The girls at the front desk were WONDERFUL!! Comfy beds, Clean. Wonderful room service. Fast elevators...and all the free coffee you desire. Now if only the street noise could be blocked out.... But that is NOT the hotel's fault. The breakfast buffet is a bit high at 25 per person but Denny's is always around the corner.  Above all else...location!! you dont need shoes to walk to the beach directly across the street. Take the $20 catamaran ride off the beach and tell them the folks from Buffalo sent you.You WILL have a great time. Mahalo ',GOOD,
'Okay for free I stayed here for free on Hyatt Reward points, and it was good enough, all things considered.Positives: the staff is very friendly and helpful, the location is superb with a direct view of the ocean from some rooms, and I really liked the breakfast buffet. Negatives: There are 2 towers: Diamond Head and Ewa. Being there for free, I was placed in the Ewa Tower, facing the sheraton, the source of Hawaiiian lounge music which dominated the room (sound coming through the balcony's sliding glass door even though closed) until almost midnight. If you pay to stay here, INSIST on the Diamond Head Tower. 2) Room service menu is overly limited. 3) No mini-bar any more. 4) Pool is tiny. Overall, this is an acceptable hotel, but hardly 4 stars if that's what you're seeking. ',POOR,

'Solid Honolulu hotel Stayed at the Hyatt the week before Christmas. Stayed on the Regency Club floors with a fantastic view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Balconies are also very nice size.The staff was very accommodating in putting us in rooms that were connected and next to each other, as we were traveling with several family members. Generally found the staff to be quite responsive.Overall the hotel is a bit older but management has done a good job of maintaining the rooms and furniture. Depending on the price differential, I would consider booking a Regency Club room, both since the higher floor rooms are further removed from the street noise (which can be very loud), and for access to the club facilities and amenities such as breakfast (especially since the hotel breakfast is pretty subpar for the price)My wife used the spa facilities and was very impressed.Negatives: the pool is definitely too small for a resort of this size and quality. The breakfast buffet is very overpriced, particuarly given the poor selection of foods.While I believe there may be better deals in Honolulu, overall the Hyatt is a very pleasant place to stay. ',GOOD,
'Good location Very nice hotel! We got this on priceline for $165. Right across the street from Waikiki. Room was very clean and beds were so comfortable! Area seemed very safe. The only complaint that I have is the Budget car rental car pick up is in the basement and is very difficult to get to. ',GOOD,
'Pleasantly Surprised       Lobby- waterfall ',GOOD,
'Beefy Boredom A steak place along the lines of Morton's or Ruth's Chris but not as good. The room looks tired with no particular theme. The service was efficient but service people should avoid using no problem in response to everything. The caesar was good and the beef tender but tasteless. There was an unfortunate incident with some guests who seated themselves which annoyed the host who insisted they return to be seated elsewhere. The place wasnt busy and this non-English speaking couple seemed bewildered by what was happening. ',POOR,
'It Was Just Ok We stayed at this hotel for 3 days after having switched from another hotel because it was too noisyI booked through the hotel on a pay for 2 days and get the third one free with breakfast included. The price did not include tax which they dont mention so you get a surprise when 12% is added on per night at the end.We booked a deluxe ocean view room. It was on the 28th floor and the views were wonderful. The room was nice but the bathroom was very small and was a disappointment for the price you pay per night. The beds were great and lots of pillows. It was not noisy on the 28th floor . The Hyatt is in a great position with the trolley stop right across the road.On the last day our phone did not work and we reported it straight away. Six hours later it still was not fixed and i reported it again. A nice lady from reception came out very apologetic and recommended we move rooms. She found us a room on the 20th floor and promised us she would send us up a nice bottle of red for our inconvenience - we never saw it !!. So that was disappointing giving up our nice room with a full view to a room with a side view only of the beach for the same price.I would not stay there again. It would have been a great hotel 20 years ago but not now. The breakfast buffet was very average.I think you are much better off spending the same amount at a hotel right on the beach that the Hyatt. ',POOR,
'Nice, but overpriced and crowded The location is great...right across the street from the Duke statue and the trolley stop. You can't beat the location but I didn't think it was worth the money. I have had better service and ammenities elsewhere. There are hotels for half the price within a block of the Hyatt that seem to be just as nice. ',POOR,
'Pleasant stay Normally I expect less for a resort hotel than a hotel catering to business travels, but this one is an exception. We arrived late at night but were arranged with the room and parking in a timely manner. Then we found that the room we book ed originally was near the elevator. So we asked the front desk whether it is possible to switch to a different room. Joji at the front desk immediately arranged an upgrade to an ocean view, which is fantastic. There are two towers within this hotel. Some tourbooks suggest not to book a room other than those in the diamond head tower, but we found that is not necessary. We did not stay at the diamond head tower, but the room we originally booked and the one we got upgraded are spacious and clean, and both offer a great view.The overall service at the hotel was quite professional. We stayed during the peak season and the hotel was crowded. But we called the guest service three times, and each time the door bell rang within 5 minutes after we hang up the phone. Both the house keeping and the luggage handler were prompt and professional.Now some notes:(1) You can choose a self-parking or a valet parking. But the parking ramp is next to the hotel's 2 towers, and the ramp is extremely narrow and difficult to navigate. Most time only one car is possible to pass. The first 3 levels of the ramp were reserved for valet. So you have to drive up in the ramp quite some time to find a good parking spot. If you plan to drive and want to park in the ramp, make sure you get a small rather than large size car if possible. (2) We loved the restaurant Ciao Mien in the hotel. The food is great. But the quality of their cocktail seems to vary a lot. The first night we had a dinner there we both ordered a cocktail and it tasted fine. Next time we were there again, the cocktail was poorly done. (As a comparison, the red moon at the Grand Hyatt Beijing is superb)(3) The hotel is huge and therefore during high season is crowded with tourists. There is a long line at the breakfast place in the morning, so make sure you get there either very early or later of the day. The breakfast serves from 6 to 11:30 am during our stay.(4) The pool is rather small (but who needs a pool when you are just steps away from the ocean?). The fitness room is also small but the equipment is first-class. ',GOOD,
'Would return next time in Oahu This was my first time in Hawaii and I wanted to stay at Waikiki. My husband and I enjoyed this hotel and location immensely. I loved the Hawaiian music they played throughout the day in the lobby area, the pool, and most especially the breakfast brunch we were spoiled with every single morning of the week! You get to sit outdoors and enjoy the ocean air.This hotel is located in the most convenient spot on Waikiki. The place is clean, has friendly staff, is secure and quiet at night. I would not dream of staying anywhere else on Waikiki and risk not enjoying myself as much as I did on my first visit to Hawaii! I dream of going back every day... ',GOOD,
'Hyatt on Waikiki Beach, soooo nice This hotel is a blast, my wife and I stayed 1 week, got a deal with breakfast that overlooks Waikiki Beach. The hotel is beautiful, rooms are generous, the hotel is open on the bottom floors because the weather is so nice. There's shopping and lots of stuff to do right on Waikiki walkways. This is essentially the heart of Waikiki/Honolulu. You'll find Pearl Harbor, Airport, major parks all within a short drive of this hotel. If you like working out, they have a nice deal with 24hour fitness for $10 dollars per 24 hour period. They have a spa and free use of their limited cardio equipment. You can't go wrong at this place, it's fantastic. Their breakfast is the best b/c you're not closed in and you have a wonderful selection of asian/international items on their menu/buffet to choose from. One bad thing, because the location is so prime, the parking is across the street and the garage is tight and tricky to get around in. Other than that, you will not be disappointed if you stay here, have a great time. ',GOOD,

'Terrible Terrible. Stay somewhere else. Zero concierge help. Girl at the desk recommended we eat dinner at the hotel or at a mall ten miles away. Expedia has some sort of service in the lobby but it mostly caters to touristy day trips. All we wanted was a recommendation of a restaurant. If a hotel staff can't manage that they need a different job.Bellman told us to take a cab to Pearl harbor when a bus ride would have saved us 40 bucks. Obviously the management does not enforce the notion of service. My wife and I are not fussy when it comes to traveling, but with the prices that the Hyat in Waikiki charges, there HAS to be a better way to spend your money. ',POOR,
'Just loved it I stayed at the Hyatt in Oct 07 for 7 nights. Now admittedly I may have been caught up in the whole Hawaii thing, but I just loved it. The hotel was elegant but not pretensious and the location was fabulous. I priced the Outrigger  Sheraton etc and I could not believe how much more they wanted for beachfront. Don't get conned this hotel may be across the road but it looks straight at the beach and Waikiki surf, and I think is towards the better end of the beach anway.We had Ocean View rooms and the outlook was incredible. Overall the rooms were great, large  comfortable with very comfy bed. Yes they were a tad dated but you could live with it because the position was second to none,. We ate at a couple of the restaurants and found them to be very good especially the italian/chinese place. The bar around the pool was very pleasant.Its proximity to the main shopping ares is ideal only being 200m to the international marketplace and across thr road frm the main beach area with all of the hire gear. It has a realatively large shopping area underneath it as well including 2 of those great ABC stores where you can literally get everything. I think this is the pick of the Waikiki hotels and would come back here without hesitation. Don't get sucked into the saving money argument and stay a street or two back. If you are in Hawaii you want to see the ocean, and trust me the Hyatt delivers! ',GOOD,
'Loved the hyatt I stayed at the Hyatt for 7 nights the end of November. It was clean and everyone was so nice. It sits right accross the street from waikiki beach and there are ABC stores everywhere. That is were you buy water snacks anything you can think of they are everywhere. ',GOOD,

'Loved the Hyatt Regency My Husband and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon in August 2007 and were absolutely blown away by the hotel and location.On arrival were were upgraded to a full ocean view room as we were on honeymoon. The room was huge and clean and tidy with the most magnificant view over Waikiki beach where we could watch the surfers and the sun set from our balcony. We were also left a free bottle of champagne in our room and all the staff (particularly the housekeeper) were very friendly and helpful.We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel if we visit Waikiki again. We cannot praise this hotel enough! ',GOOD,
'Assault I really liked this hotel in times past and as a travel agent for a very large reputable firm have sent quite a bit of business their way, however was gravely dissapointed by the way in which Hyatt neglected to ensure our safety and security! My family, friends and I were attacked and assaulted right in the jacuzzi and the hotel staff did nothing to prevent or stop this until it was too late. Then when it was over and the police came the hotel manager on duty refused to remove the assailants from the property as he said they were victims too when it was apparent these heavily intoxicated people perpetrated the act. For example, the primary assailant attempted to murder one of my traveling companions as her hair was pulled and head held under water while her husband who shouted sexual obsenities toward us watched. Hyatt failed to take care of us before and after this incident and for that I can never recommend them again. ',POOR,
'overdue review - stayed memorial day 2007 Picked the Hyatt b/c it is directly across from Waikiki surfing beach and my FI and I were there to improve our surfing by going out 2x a day. Didn't want to spend $$$$$ when none of the Waikiki hotels are that amazing and most of them are overpriced, but wanted to stay somewhere nice, and I got a pretty good deal thru Travelocity that included breakfast.The breakfast buffet was a very satisfying spread of a variety of foods and made the deal especially worth it - basically, we'd get up early and surf, come back and shower, and then head to breakfast around 10:30 or 11 and it ended up serving as our lunch too since we stuffed ourselves! It included made to order eggs, American buffet food (waffles, meats, fruit, cereal, french toast, pastries, etc.), and Japanese buffet food (miso soup, meat, fish, rice, and some other things I can't recall). Service was very nice with coffee and so forth brought to the table for you. We didn't have to wait in line to get in b/c we got to brunch so late, but if you get there before 10 there may be a wait (we'd see a long line when coming back from surfing).Our room was right behind an elevator which I feared would keep us up with the mechanical noise, but I guess we were tired (plus we brought along a sound machine). The room was small but the bed was comfy (especially compared to our horrible uncomfortable bed experience at the otherwise equally as lovely Marriott the previous year), and we had a view of Diamond Head although we had booked a city view (upgrade?). I registered as a Gold member before going, which made the coffee pods and a newspaper complimentary each day.While we were there our friends were at the Outrigger on the beach, and although they had an amazing balcony over the water, their room was a lot more outdated and motelish and they paid more than us.The gym was satisfactory. There were tv screens on the cardiovascular equipment, and towels were provided.I was very satisfied with our stay at the Hyatt considering my relative expectations of vacationing in Waikiki (for me has a primary purpose of easy surfing, or else I'd go elsewhere to my more favored areas of Hawaii). This was my 3rd time in Waikiki. ',GOOD,
'Met all expectations We chose this hotel based on the room size because we were going to be traveling with 2 teenagers. It was actually very large and comfortable. Wish that they had rooms with larger beds. Doubles are way to small no matter what your size! Otherwise the hotel was awesome. The location is better than being directly on the beach and much quieter. Everything you need is right there, even an ABC store on site. You can check out sand chairs to take to the beach, which is directly across the street. Barbara at the pool bar is absolutely the BEST, very nice and friendly. Check your bill closely cause they charge for everything whether you use it or not. But they were great about crediting any errors. Overall the right choice for us and would stay there again!! ',GOOD,
'Beautiful Honeymoon with personalized service! We stayed at the Hyatt Waikiki for four nights and wished we stayed longer. This was our first trip to Hawaii and the first hotel we stayed at during our honeymoon (we also stayed at the Sheraton in Kauai *BLECK* and the Westin in Maui *eh*. The Hyatt was the perfect place for us since we are from NYC and are used to the hustle and bustle of things. Waikiki is a gorgeous city with PLENTY to do. The Hyatt itself is a beautiful property with a room to suit anyone. It is located across the street from the beach where you can take surfing lessons (we did!) and rent equipment. The restaurants at the Hyatt were so-so. Our room rate included a breakfast buffet every morning, ch was nice and not something we ever would have paid $24.95 each for. Musashi was very mediocre sushi, but they sent us free dessert while we were there since it was our honeymoon. Oh, and the free champagne! The hotel is very family friendly and offers kids' room service, which we ordered for dessert one night (horray for brownie sundaes that look like clowns!) If you're there do NOT miss the Elegant Dive, their poolside bar and grill or their spa-their lomi lomi couples massage is not to be missed. Barbara is the nicest server I have ever encountered and remembered us by name after lounging by the pool only once. The check-in and check-out process was a breeze and the staff was attentive to our needs. We will return as soon as we recover from the jetlag... ',GOOD,
'Great Breakfast During our four days' stay in Hyatt, the most memorable thing was their breakfast buffet (which was included for the hotel guests). The breakfast serves western traditional breakfast food with the additions of tasty Asian choices (there are a lot of Asian tourists staying in the hotel). The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room we stayed at wasn't impressive. It was rather small. There is no fridge. We rented a fridge from the hotel for about $15. The fridge was tiny. We liked the pool and hot tubs. Every night there was live music entertainment at the pool area. The spa facility was nice, but pretty pricy. Overall, we had a pleasant experience staying at Hyatt in Waikiki, would recommend it to others. ',GOOD,
'Hyatt Overbooked We booked our stay for eight nights at the Hyatt for September in March 2007.We did read reviews on tripadvisor. We arrived after a day of getting up very early, being jammed in a plane for 7 hrs,and our shuttle bus to the Hyatt left us at the airport as our flight was late only to find out the Hyatt had overbooked and we were being moved for 1 night to the Sheraton Waikiki. We were not given a chance to say NO WAY, we were just put into a cab and off we went. Hyatt did pay for the cab to Sheraton and back to Hyatt the next day, but what a hassle, We wanted to unpack, find food and Relax. But no, we had to stand in another check in line, argue with the Sheraton about our room (it was to be equal or better than what we were to get at the Hyatt). They gave us an ocean view alright...RIGHT OVER THE POOL BAR !! Loud music til 10pm. We got about 3 hrs of sleep. We had breakfast (included in our package) Sheraton did have a great view of Diamond Head at the resturant. We walked along the beach that am and then took the cab back to Hyatt. Once back at the Hyatt we did get a nice room on the 27th floor with a great view of the beach and Diamond Head, the room was spacious and furnished nicely. We asked and were given a free dinner at the Colony restaurant, it was great! Good service and great food, very pricey. Also we were given a 200 dollar room credit. As some have mentioned the pool is small for such a large hotel, but we always found two lounges next to one another and the pool staff was great! Really enjoyed the ABC stores and Made in Hawaii Too stores in the hotel . Some service was spotty, did not get turn down every night as we were supposed to and also did not get paper delivered each day until we asked twice. Sometimes the room was not cleaned until late in the day, making it difficult to relax and clean up after a day at the pool,beach or snorkling before going to dinner. ',POOR,
'Nice Hotel but Nickled  Stayed five nights, Sept. 10-15. Paid $264 a night for a deluxe ocean front room through AAA. The hotel is beautiful, the lobby is basically a three story open-air atrium with all kinds of shops and a beautiful waterfall. We checked in at 3:00pm but the room was not ready and was told the room would not be ready till 5:00. They gave us an upgrade to the Regency Club lounge to apologize for the delay, but that did not open until 5:00 either so what was the big deal? (Side note: don't spend any extra money on a room with access to this lounge, it is a total waste of money, the breakfast was basically some stale bagels, orange juice, and coffee, (no decaf). The lounge is only open for cocktails from 5:00pm - 8:30pm, the exact time you will be probably showering up, going out to dinner and not in the hotel, what a coincidence). Our room was large and looked to be recently upgraded, new flat screen TV, etc. but we did not get the king bed we requested, only a double. When we called to request another room, we were told the hotel was completely booked and they would call us tomorrow, which of course they never did. When we called the next day they said we could move to a room in the other tower, (we had requested, and received the Diamond Head Tower which is directly in front of the center of Waikiki Beach, the Ewa Tower kind of overlooks the new section of the Mauna Surfrider.) The other room was much smaller than ours, had a much worse view and was kind of dark, so we just kept our original room and made do with the small bed. (The towers are shaped like octogons and the rooms on the front and sides are much larger than the ones on the angle sides, if that makes any sense.) They charge $25 a day for valet parking, which was extremely prompt in getting our car and all the valets were really nice, but still, $25 a day?! They will also charge you if you want an empty refrigerator, we put a couple of water bottles that we bought into the mini bar fridge and they locked it on us! And then charged us $1.57 on our bill for each bottle we put in the fridge! Unbelievable!Anyway, the hotel is really nice and the location can't be beat. It is a great deal compared to the hotels that are directly on the beach, our room had a great view for about half of what you would pay for a ocean front room across the street at the Mauna or Outrigger. The room was always clean and pretty quiet and the lobby area was by far the nicest of any hotel we saw in Waikiki, but the nickel and diminess kind of grated on us. ',POOR,
'Top notch stay(s) at the Hyatt Waikiki My husband and I had a three night pre-cruise stay in late July at the Hyatt Waikiki booked on Gold Passport points in the Regency Club, mountain view. The room was large, newly redocorated and had a flat panel tv, as well as a view of Diamond Head and a balcony. The bed wasn't as comfortable as most Hyatts we have stayed at, but we were usually exhausted so it was fine. It was a little dark as it was on the shady side, but cool and comfortable. There was a coffee maker, but we never used it as we had Regency Club privileges. The main pool is very small, but there is a private rooftop sundeck with padded loungers, a hot tub, and free bottled water and towels for Regency Club guests. You can get free backpack beach chairs at the pool to take across the street to the famous Waikiki Beach. The location of the hotel is perfect--across the street from the best action on Waikiki with the beach boys and surfboard rentals. And a thirty second stroll to shopping, from the most expensive designer store to the ubiquitous ABC stores. There's also a good, cheap beach bar for inexpensive lunches and snacks on this beach, called Hyatt on the Beach. We came back to the Hyatt for one night and most of the next day post cruise as we had a red eye flight to Vegas. Although we could not obtain Regency Club reservations on initial booking for this part of the trip, upon check-in we were upgraded to the Ambassador Suite since they could not get us a room near my parents, who were traveling with us. The suite was nearly 1600 square feet, with two huge bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living and a dining room with every amenity, including Regency Club service. Now that's an upgrade! Cary, Mark, and Micheline of the Regency Club staff deserve special mention by name for their outstanding customer service--and I have seen them mentioned on several websites. They all go the extra mile every day for their guests. Cary and Mark's smiling interplay with guests and each other keep the cocktail hour guests entertained. Regency Club includes free continental breakfast in a private lounge and free evening cocktails and snacks. The food and drinks are always great, the service is stellar and it's fun to meet other guests in an intimate atmosphere. Oh, the service....they mailed my postcards for me, they brought me a fresh vegetable tray when they noticed I was looking for more...they gave me a to go cup to take my gin and tonic to the airport...and Micheline recommended tours, as well as checking us out in the Club and arranging for us to stay in the suite until 6 p.m. on checkout day (instead of 11 a.m.) Plus we could enjoy Regency Club hospitality until we left for the airport at 8 p.m. In short, having a regular room at the Hyatt may not be as special ---but if you can swing it, or are a Gold Passport member, I would highly recommend a stay here in the Regency Club. I'm dreaming of the day when I can go back. It's all about the service! ',GOOD,
'Don't bother- overrated We were at another place nearby for 1 night before moving to the Hyatt for the next 2 nights. If I hadn't been redeeming Gold Passport points, I would have been even more disappointed.I learned (by asking) prior to my stay that although there are no resort fees, there was a fee of $19/day for a fridge in the room. Luckily I asked so we could opt out. Why do they need to do this? Is a fridge an extravagant luxury? These nickel and dime fees at upscale hotels are really annoying. This room was listed online at $300/night. I shouldn't have to pay $19/day for a fridge. Ah, the light fingered Hyatt touch. The room was large, yes, but unimpressive, blandly decorated. Small bathroom. We were on the backside of the property for the category selected. We had a nice terrace which would have been great for morning coffee, however, our in-room coffee maker included some set-ups, like sugar and paper cups, but no coffee. I assume there was a fee for the coffee. More Hyatt touch. We also had no bathrobes. Available, for a fee? I don't know. I know these are little things, but I indeed expect those little things. Isn't that the Hyatt touch? BTW, our $75/nt place down the street had plenty of in-room coffee, not to mention also free in-room internet, robes, free coffee in the lobby accompanied by a (free) cont'l breakfast and even a fridge, also complimentary. As a result, I continued to ask myself, why am I here?, then I asked, why are all these other people here? The check-in process was very impersonal. I assume they were hoping I'd use the check-in kiosk and not bother the desk staff. No bellmen for baggage ass't. On departure, we were directed to the bell stand for storing bags. When I asked the Hyatt person at the hotel entrance if he was the bell stand, he could only say nope, and wasn't int'd in directing me to the proper person/place. Unless I was interested in a taxi, he wasn't int'd in me or my bags. We did sort it out and found the bell person. I see all of the very high ratings of this hotel on this site and wonder if I was in the same place. IMO, it was pretentious, over-priced, under served, and those annoying fees. Thanks Hyatt, keep your fridge, I'll go back to the friendly place 2 blocks away and save my money for diving.As a 3 star hotel this was fine, but as a Hyatt, with Hyatt prices, I expected much more and was very disappointed.

'Awwfullll! Don't stay here! I stayed at the Hyatt since they were doing construction at my apartment and guess what? They were doing construction at the Hyatt also! I was so irritated! The last morning of my stay, they started hammering at 7:45 a.m. I stayed up late the night before thinking I could sleep in until at least 10:00 a.m. before I had to check out. There was no warning about the construction that sounded like it was on top of my head! Okay, the bedroom was nice but the bathroom was horrible! The lighting was dingy and everything about it was old! It's like they ran out of money at the bathroom. The door to the tub/shower and toilet was battered and worn, the tub was ugly. There were all these water stains and no light above the tub so when you closed the opaque shower curtains, you were practically in the dark. For the price of the Hyatt, I would expect a much nicer bathroom. Even the Super 8 Motel has brighter, nicer, bathrooms. To top it off, they charge you for the in-room coffee! They have one of those pod coffee makers and they don't give you even 1 cup of coffee free. Plus, if you take anything out of the minibar, they charge you for it. I took out some sodas and put them right on top of the minibar to put a cheesecake in, and they charged me for the sodas that I put back the next day. Unbelieveable! The parking is also horrible and dangerous! The valets there come speeding down the corners and the lot is just too small for all these SUVs that everyone seems to have/rent. It doesn't help that the marked stalls seem more narrow than normal. Lastly, the Japanese restaurant Musashi was awful too! Way overpriced and the food was mediocre. My stay at the Hyatt was an overall awful experience! ',POOR,
'Perfect Waikiki oasis The Hyatt Waikiki is located n the center of a very busy shopping mecca, directly across from Waikiki beach. For its guests, it represents a beautifully maintained, tranquil oasis .Our 3 night stay was wonderful. We were upgraded to a lovely, spacious ocean front room on the 19th floor overlooking Waikiki Beach. The view from our Lani was simply spectacular.Customer service was warm and accommodating, with attention given to every detail. The pool area is small but beach chairs and towels are available for use on the shores of Waikiki. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a wonderful waitstaff and a host who remembered our names and preferences by our second morning.Hyatt Waikiki epitomizes the Aloha Spirit and Hyatt's reputation for excellence.In comparison to our very disappointing stay at Hyatt Regency Maui, this was simply the BEST!. ',GOOD,
'It wasn't Great AT ALL!       view from pool deck ',POOR,
'Loved the ambience We were originally booked to stay for 2 nights on a budget Aqua Ocean Tower, but check out from that place after one night due to an extremely moldy room condition and smell. We landed Hyatt for $165 plus tax and fees (total of about $195) via Priceline on the morning of the check-in (about 10 am), packed up and arrived at Hyatt around 10:30 am, checked-in and left our luggage with the bell desk, and was admitted to our room around 1 pm. Overall, the hotel was in great shape, and the amenities were top class. We're usually budget travelers, so this was a real treat at approximately $50 more than what we paid the previous night at the Aqua Ocean Tower. The rooms were about twice as large as the Aqua, and carried a fresh scent as soon as we opened the door to our room. Locationwise, Hyatt is a crosswalk away from the center of Waikiki action, and our family thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay. After we checked out the next morning, our flight to the Big Island wasn't until late in the evening, and when we asked for a hospitality unit to wash up after a day in Waikiki, they graciously offered us a unit for one hour. Overall, two big thumbs up for the Hyatt Waikiki. We'll definitey come back. ',GOOD,
'Wasn't The Best  We stayed at the Hyatt Waikiki 8/1 - 8/3 in the Diamondhead Tower. I believe this area of the hotel is an older area, as it seemed a little outdated and needs some refurbishing. The carpets were a bit dirty in the cooridor areas and the rooms were not all that sound proof. You could hear the sounds from inside the rooms while in the cooridor area. The actual room we were in was in definite need of new carpet, it was grungy looking and some of the seams were coming up around the area of where it met the bathroom door so there were threads coming up. The actual bathroom where the toilet and shower/bath were was very small and the fixtures were very outdated. However, the bed was very comfortable and the linens were nice and the pillows quite plump and comfortable as well. The refridgerator of course was fully stocked with excessivly overpriced items, sode @ $2.50 per can, 16 oz bottle of Fuji Water was $5.50 per bottle, etc. but that's a hotel for you and to boot Hawaii too!! The location of the hotel is nice, however it's very hussle bussle and very busy all the time. The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is extremely expensive, $25 a person, however children 4 and under eat free at the buffet with a paying adult which is nice. You can definitely eat enough so you don't need to eat lunch, or just need something light for lunch, so it kind of evens out paying that much, althought it is quite expensive. One thing to note when eating outside at the restaurant is the bird/pigeon problem. There are birds every where constantly trying to get at food left on tables from previous diners, and if you get up be careful your plate is either guarded or empty, because they will swoop in while you're gone. The waiters are constantly doing what they can to get the birds out of the area, however it is a little pesky while trying to eat and kind of ruins the whole outside thing. There are signs posted not to feed the birds, although they do a good job of finding their own food with out having to be fed by anyone. The conceiarge staff was nice and helpful, although I can't say the same for the bell staff. I asked for a cab and sat there for 15 minutes before I realized that they either ignored my request or forgot about it, needeless to say I had to ask again. The front desk staff (Danica especially) was very pleasant. Beware, if you don't bring your own computer there is one available in the business center to use to the tune of $0.65 per minute, which is quite a rip off, but Hawaii for you. The beach is great, and there is plenty of space, although it's always quite crowded. All in all I felt the hotel was satisfactory, it wasn't over the top, but it wasn't a motel 6 either. I think it's got some work to bring it up to a quote luxury property, although that may not be what they're looking to be considered either. ',POOR,
'Loved the Hyatt This was my 1st trip to Hawaii (Honolulu) and I must the admit the Hyatt lived up to its expectations. The entire staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The location was great (on the beach and around the corner from the International Marketplace - a great place to buy souvenirs). The rooms were spacious and clean. We even received a free room upgrade just by asking. I would recommend trying to book a room with the breakfast buffet included as food can get very pricey. I would also recommend getting a massage. It, too, was a little pricey but well worth it. I would definitely stay here again with my next visit to Hawaii. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Location This hotel location is the place to be. You walk out the hotel's front entrance and cross the street, and you are on the best part of Waiki Beach. The hotel consists of 2 towers joined by a 3 storylush waterfall lobby. It's difficult to get your bearings when you first walk in the large lobby, and our group didn't master finding the tower elevators til the third day. Rooms were typical Hyatt rooms. Use valet parking, its so convenient. Parking yourself can be a challenge. Parking spaces are so small!. ',GOOD,
'Great location and that's all We stayed 3 nights at the Hyatt in Honolulu after a disappointing 4 nights at the Hyatt Maui (see review). Again, this Hyatt was not 5 stars either.We were on the diamond level - the carpet in the hallway was filthy. The room was ok - balcony small - bathroom dated (toilet seat color did not match toilet tank color) and again a plastic shower curtain over tub.Breakfast buffet was ok - but not worth waiting in line for. Never tried any other restaurants at the hotel. We used the in-room safe twice a day and was very surprised by the fee at the end of our stay. They charge $3.15 everytime you use it. We called down to question the bill and were told didn't you see the sign? We said there was no sign so they took it off of our bill.If we ever go back to Honolulu the Hyatt will not be on our list.

'Not too bad, not too good We just got back from our vacation at the Hyatt. We thought that Hyatt has one of the best locations in Waikiki....you can take a late stroll all along Kalakaua...with all it's major shops. Waikiki beach is just across the street....but not the best beach we visited in Oahu. We also found it convinent to get around Oahu....with the Hyatt kind of being at the middle of everything from Hunauma Bay to the USS Arizona Memorial. The hotel even has the little shops in levels 1 and 2 for everyone to shop at. For convience this is a great place. Oh, if your vacation package includes a daily breakfast buffet...then cool go try it out...it wasn't too bad. However, if I had to pay the amount that they were charging if it wasn't included with your trip...then I say: it's not really worth it.However, if you don't like the traffic/noise from all the cars/tourists then this is not the place you want to stay at. The parking situation was not the best. It was a torturous task everyday just to get in an out of the parking garage, which will cost you $18 a day...even if you are staying there....this doesn't include valet parking. The hotel room was okay....little older, but still nice. The towels were not the cleanest....they really need to try to get new ones or just try to clean the one's they have a little better! Overall it was a nice experience....just not sure if the price that we got charged was really worth it. May or may not stall here next the next time we visit. ',POOR,
'Great Location       Diamondhead ',GOOD,
'Excellent hospitality We booked this for our post-cruise stay for just one night. We got a room on the 10th floor with a very small partial ocean view. The room itself is very spacious(bigger than most hotel rooms we have stayed), clean and comfortable. All rooms have lanai. The best part is the location. It's in the most convenient part of Waikiki. Since we don't have a car, this is definitely a plus. There is a nightly hula dance show right across the street by the beach at 6:30. Why we rate it 5 star is their service. Our flight didn't leave until 9pm. We told them that we really want to do some snorkeling at Hanauma Bay after we checked out. The staff told us that we could check into their hospitality room(first come first serve) to freshen up before we head out to the airport. Now that is service! We simply dropped off our luggages with the bell boy that morning, then did our water activities. We checked back with the hotel at 6 and got our hospitality room for 1 hour use to freshen up. That was really great. We wouldn't have done any fun water activities that day if we weren't given a place to freshen up before we fly red-eye back to the mainland. Way to go! I would stay here again in a heart beat. ',GOOD,
'GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is an EXCELLENT HOTEL (location, rooms, food, common areas...) ',GOOD,
'Love Hawaii but not necessarily the Hyatt . . . . As with most of the 5 star hotels on Waikiki, this hotel is NOT a resort. It is a nice, upscale hotel that is comfortable. There are better values to be had than the Hyatt. The room is comfortable in that it is spacious and the bedding is very nice. The pool is TINY and given the hotel has 1200 rooms has the potential to be overcrowded. A band plays in the evening by the pool til 10:00 and if you have an ocean view room, it feels like the band is on your lanai! The doors slam in the hallway which is disturbing - the echo is quite loud. The Terrace restaurant was great for lunch. Try the Hula Grill (above Duke's in the Outrigger) for breakfast - it's a great value especially if you are looking for something other than the buffet scene (the staff are wonderful as is the food). Be aware you will be charged $15 to have refrigerator in your room ($15 for the entire stay) which is a ridiculous considering you are at the Hyatt! The least they can do is offer you a small frig. You can sign out beach chairs by the pool which is a very nice feature. The staff were very hospitable and accomodating. Drinks (poolside) are fairly reasonably priced. All in all, we would stay there again if the price was right . . . but it would have to be a great price. ',POOR,
'Excellent Rooms...horrible food       24th floor ocean view ',GOOD,
'Not bad, but not perfect This is hard to write. I stayed here for 6 nights for business this past Fall. There are some pluses and minuses to the hotel. Overall it's not bad and I would recommend it depending upon the price or deal you get.The room I had was a good size, clean, comfortable bed, decorated nicely, had a chair and ottoman, desk, big dresser, two end tables...armoire with TV. The closet nice sized, there was a large vanity w/sink outside the room with the shower and toliet. So, for a couple of people it's convenient and large.There were nice tolietries, hair dryer, iron, etc. You have to pay for the in-room coffee, which is unreal, but that's hyatt for you. The balcony was small, but ok. You can control your own room's temperature. I didn't hear the neighbors much other than when they slammed their doors, so it was comfortable for business traveling.The hotel itself has many restaurants, a coffee shop, is big, and requires a lot of walking getting around to the various places (front desk, ground floor, etc). The pool is very small, but we loved the pool bar and the night bartender is a GREAT guy!It is in a GREAT location in Waikiki. Not on the ocean side, but across kalekekua where there are no other hotels on the beach side, so if you get an ocean view room, it's across the street, but a decent view. There are enough ABC stores to go around and plenty of shopping in the hotel shopping area and on the street nearby.We ate at the hotel's italian-chinese (yes, that's what i said) restaurant one night and we found it to be way over priced (pay xtra for rice?!) and poor service, as well as marginal food. But, the ambience and decor was nice. The regular restaurant for breakfast is pretty good, and you can sit iin the open indoors or out on the deck (but it's up on the 3rd floor so you cannot see the beach from here -- like the pool deck).the parking location if you're in the ewa tower is a long walk to get to -- we chose to valet since the parking gararge was actual across the street from the diamond head tower .All in all, i would return here if paying on my own dime, however, not if it's more than the waikiki marriott down the street. this time was at least $350/night and i didn't even get the ocean view room. i was dispointed by that b/c the rooms themselves were just not worth $350/night to me, since i've stayed in waikiki and all over hawaii a lot and have had better rooms for a much better price. Try Duke's down the street for dinner and for the brunch. If you want local food, try the I Love Country Cafe, which is in a strip mall near the Ala Moana (bus or drive distance). Also, Ryan's in the mall is a favorite for the locals, decent dinners and food. ',POOR,
'Great place to stay My wife and i recently spent 3 nights of our honeymoon at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki. The hotel itself is beautiful. It has a 3 story waterfall inside and many shops and restaurants to visit. We had an ocean view room on the 27th floor. The rooms are neat, the beds are comfortable, there's plenty of dresser space to store your clothes and the view from the balcony was great. If you can, try to get a package with breakfast included. We saw this as a money saver, as most restaurants in Waikiki can be expensive (even the simple burger joints). As another money saving tip, I would also suggest going to the local ABC stores (they are small conveience stores in the hotel and literally on every block in Waikiki) and buying simple things like water, crackers, chips, etc and eating that for lunch. Trust me, we did this and saved a lot. The streets of Waikiki are always busy, especially at night. The Hawaiian islands are about halfway between U.S. mainland and Japan/China and Austrailia, so we saw lots of people from other countries which was great. The bell hop told us that they average about 5 weddings a day at this hotel (and i believe it because we saw plenty of brides and grooms!), so if you're looking for piece and quiet, this may not be the place for you, unless you plan on staying in your room:).Take a couple of the tours and learn about Hawaiian culture. We did the Polynesian Culture tour which was all day (leave at 12 noon and get back about 10pm) and we did a luau and saw a Polynesian dance show. We also did a short 3 hr tour where we hiked thru a rain forest (yes there are rain forests in Hawaii). ',GOOD,
'Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous We had the most fabulous stay at the Hyatt. Beautiful hotel, fabulous location, very clean. Extremely friendly staff. Great breakfast buffet. Convenient parking. East to navigate. Wonderful room. Maid service was first rate. We have traveled the world, and this hotel is at the top of our list. Will definitely return and stay longer. I don't think there is a better place to stay in Waikiki. ',GOOD,

'Very nice hotel We visited Waikiki for our 20th Anniversary. In fact, we were able to get a flight one day earlier than planned, so when we arrived, we called the hotel. The front desk person was very nice to us and gave us a room on the 7th floor. It was a beautiful room, but there was another hotel partially blocking our ocean view. The next morning, I called down to the front desk and requested a change to a higher floor. Within 1/2 hour a bellman appeared with new keys to our room on the 14th floor, a Deluxe Ocean View. He moved us and the room was fantastic. Very nice hotel staff! The room was great, the service was fantastic, but if you're looking for extras, not the place to visit. I'm one of those people who loves her morning coffee, but the room only had a small, one-cup-at-a-time coffeemaker. The only way to make coffee in this coffeemaker was to purchase from the mini-bar at $1.50 per cup. Not a bad price, but we're kind of used to a pot of coffee in the morning. So -- we went across the street to the Sheraton Princess Deli every morning. This deli is very convenient, with Kona Coffee and good, hot food.For our anniversary dinner, we visited The Colony Restaurant, the hotel's steak and seafood restaurant. Very excellent service! My husband had the Rib Eye Steak and said it was the best he's ever tasted. We had a wonderful time in this island paradise and would visit the Hyatt Regency again, but next time I'll bring my own coffeepot! ',GOOD,
'Waikiki Hyatt was great My husband, 11 year old son and myself stayed at the Hyatt Hotel in Waikiki for four nights at the end of July. Our travel agent bookd an ocean view room and upon check in we were upgraded to a full ocean front. The room had gorgeous views of the ocean and partial Waikiki strip. The room was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side but functional. Upon arriving at the hotel it was a little confusing locating the check in desk. It wasn't clearly marked. Ourselves and another couple wondered around for a short while until we saw a very small sign. We thought the location was great. The beach was right outside the front door across the street. Busy street but there was a pedestrian walkway right out front. We did not rent a car. We took the taxis and bus to where ever we needed to go although you may want to take another mode of transportation to Pearl Harbor. One way was close to $50.00 including a tip. We took the bus back. A lot cheaper but time consuming. Our travel agent booked the breakfast buffet with our package. If it was not included with our package I would not have gotten it more than once. The convenience of having the buffet was great but food was average. The pool was very small but there were plent y of wonderful rocking chairs and lounge chairs surrounding it. On our first night, they were showing a movie at the pool They put large floating rafts in the pool, which my son enjoyed. They also served plenty of popcorn. We had light fare at the Elegant Dive restaurant/bar near the pool. This also was enjoyable. All staff we encountered at the hotel were very nice. The Hyatt is a very easy walk to the International Marketplace. and many restaurants. We wanted to try the Colony Restaurant but did not. As other reviewers have stated the ABC store located in the mall adjacent to the Hyatt was great. Very inexpensive nice items such as t-shirts, snacks, water, etc. Kimos coffee in the mall had excellent coffee. The best coffee we had while staying on Oahu and Maui. They do get very busy early in the moring but worth a wait. We did use the Expedia Desk in the Hyatt to book a catamaran ride. The woman helping me at the Expedia desk was helpful. Booked the boat ride and took the ride all within a couple of hours.I would definately consider staying at the Hyatt in Waikiki should we return to Oahu. ',GOOD,
'Hawaiian Hospitality We stayed at the Hyatt from September 23-27. We had booked a package through Pleasant Holidays and had ocean view accomodations on the 24th floor Diamond Level. This floor is available to book only through Pleasant Holidays and has restricted elevator access. If you have any security concerns, this would be a big plus.Our room overlooked Waikiki Beach on the Diamond Head side. The high level of the floor combined with facing the less busy side of Waikiki meant that we heard almost no street traffic - only the sound of the ocean and the happy noise people make playing on the beach. The lanai was large enough for two comfortable chairs and a small table. Our lanai received morning sun, so it was very pleasant to sit in the afternoon and evening watching the surfers and swimmers and enjoying the view of the ocean.The Diamond Level had been recently refurbished and the room was beautifully decorated in subdued Hawaiiana. The beds were comfortable and the linens were crisp yet soft. The bathroom area is quite small, but they have done their best to update the fixtures and counters. There is a single sink set in a granite countertop. The furnished toiletries were very nice.We were impressed throughout our stay with the fine level of service. The valets were quick in getting our car, the front desk personnel were helpful and welcoming at check-in, the housekeeping staff greeted us with a smile and an aloha when we saw them. Our package included a daily buffet breakfast and the restaurant staff greeted us by name and welcomed us every morning.Given the comfortable accomodations, great service and superb location we will definitely be back to the Hyatt soon.

'Nice place bad service Staff: Beware of a few of the discourteous front desk staff. One of them had plenty of snooty and patronizing verbiage to dole out sans any eagerness to help. I was appalled by the belittling tone she used to address the Japanese tourists. She tried that with me. I put her back in he place within the first 5 mins. But she put us in a stinking hole. I guess she 鈥榳on鈥?and Hyatt must be proud of her. Anyway the front desk guy next day made up for her offensive demeanor. Room: Bait and switch. First 3 nights in a muggy room with the view of other buildings. The guy at the front desk helped us switch to a renovated room in the other tower. Can鈥檛 complain, that room was excellent with a partial view of the ocean. Loud music from downstairs, did not bother us that much though. Expedia staff: There was a lifeless guy 鈥榤anaging鈥?the desk, who was more interested in carrying on the phone conversation than doing business. I don鈥檛 believe that he was commission was a part of his incentive package. We went to get some advice on destinations and airfares to the Big Island and Maui/Kawaii, and came back with phone numbers etc. The next day luckily a senior guy was there who was very helpful and we sorted out everything. Overall service: Good. Breakfast: Good. Continental  Japanese. No variation, day in and day out. Facilities: NiceOverall experience: Fantastic. Repeat visit to HRWRS: Not in this lifetime. There are cheaper and better placesRepeat visit to Hawaii: Yes. Strongly, advice Kawaii or Maui instead of Waikiki. ',POOR,
'A nice, big place We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights before going to Maui. We chose it for the price and central location. We booked an ocean view room, which we were told at check-in only has a partial view. So, they upgraded us to an ocean front. The views were excellent. The room was spacious and clean. The service was pleasant. The pool was tiny, but that was okay just for 2 nights. We did enjoy having our coffee in the mornings sitting in the rocking chairs by the pool overlooking the ocean.As others have said, there weren't any extras - not even coffee for the machine in the room. Also, the hotel is very big, and it is easy to get disoriented. Overall, we did enjoy our stay. We would stay here again, but wouldn't mind trying something with a little more of a quaint feeling to it. ',GOOD,

'Would stay there again and again We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki for the first time and had a great experience. First of all, the location is unprecedented- two steps away from the beaches of Waikiki (where you can rent surfboards) and lots of shopping. The pool are was small, but very clean and uncrowded. The Na Ho'ola Spa is wonderful with grand views of the ocean and experienced the lomi lomi massage- heaven! Our room was very clean and the bed and comforter was extremely comfortable. The daily breakfast buffet was also nice- sit outside on the patio and feel the tradewinds as you enjoy your meal. We had a great time there and for those who want to stay in Waikiki, this is the perfect place. I would definitely stay there again and again. The one thing I would have liked is free parking...but who doesnt? And since this hotel is centrally located, if you want to just experience Waikiki, there is no need for a car. ',GOOD,
'Hyatt resort is just ok The hotel is rather out dated, meaning the check in desk is on the 2nd floor and with the escalator under construction this means lifting the baggage up the stairs or giving the porters a tip to take them up a elevator in the rear. The floors are wet from a water fall scheme that is very smelly and with grey water coming from the 2nd floor of a hotel it seems like something is wrong with the plumbing. The staff could do better but, with a looming union strike pending then I guess we got all that we could out of them.The location is ok and the sunsets are unmatched for Waikiki because we were in the center of the beach with no hotel or building in front of us.For Hyatt resort it missed the mark. for a hotel on the beach of Waikiki it just good.We had a chance to eat at several of the restaurants on the location and one was great and others ok.

'Great hotel and location My Husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Waikiki for 3 nights as part of the Perillo 12 day 4 Islander tour. (7/24-7/27/06)The hotel was beautiful and we had a spacious ocean front room. The bed was heavenly and we even had turn down service in the evening. The beach is directly across the street. The pool is small, but the beach is where you want to be. We ate at the Colony restaurant in the hotel one evening and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this hotel as well as highly recommend Perillo tours. The atrium in the hotel is beautiful and the ABC store has all the water, snacks, etc, that you may need. Honolulu was very clean and I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and how safe we felt walking on the beach, even very early in the morning. We cannot wait to return; Hawaii is like heaven on earth. ',GOOD,
'OK, but could have been better We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 2 nights, Jul 9th  10th. It was just OK. For the elite status of the name Hyatt, I was annoyed by the fact that you are nickle  dimed to death in your room. Coffee is $1.50 per cup. The in-room safe is $3.00 per day. For the price they charge for the room, those little things should be free. The room size was good and the room was very clean. I would not highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Great Location, but requires major renovation Great place to stay in the heart of Waikiki however, for the price the Hyatt commands for it鈥檚 hotel rooms it needs major renovations. Upon my arrival I was greeted by the Hyatt鈥檚 Valet / Bell Service representative that assisted me with my luggage and parked my rental car. I was also greeted by angry guess waiting up to 35 to 45 minutes for a car, which gave me a sense things were not going well for the Hyatt. Once you have taken care of your car and luggage the hotel service representative will direct you to its Lobby level, which is located upstairs via the escalators. Don鈥檛 worry about searching for the escalators you will hear them first, since they have some major maintenance issues. I did notice the attractive atrium with a waterfall and lush plants on the lower level. I had an Ocean Deluxe room on the 24th floor, in the Diamond Head tower. The Elevators are quick, but requires some major maintenance. I found the room very comfortable, particularly the feather pillows, though would have felt that supplying coffee with the coffee maker in the room would have been a welcoming touch. The Hyatt does have Coffee 鈥減er Cup鈥?for the Coffee Maker, but you will need to pay $1.50 for packet and it鈥檚 located within the honor bar, however if you signup to be a Hyatt Gold Club Member, it鈥檚 free. I suggest you go downstairs to get a cup of coffee from the shop in the mall. One comment about the maid service, rooms seemed to be made up at random times, any time from 9am to after 1pm.Restaurants: They have several on site - Ciao Mein, the Colony, Terrace Grill, Musashi, and the Elegant Dive. I had dinner at Ciao Mein with it鈥檚 combination of Chinese and Italian dishes to choose from, it was good. Note: On selected nights Ciao Mein turns into a Night Club, check with the Bartenders or hotel for these nights. The breakfast setting at the Terrace Grill is most attractive, however the buffet breakfast lacked any sort of bread or toast apart from mini bagels, or on one occasion French toast. The Colony focuses on Steaks and Seafood and Musashi is Japanese. Note: If you take a walk outside of the Hotel, just behind the hotel is Kings Alley and they have all sorts of Fast Food places to choose from, for those who want something else to dine on.Valet Service: Make sure you call at least 10-15 minutes before you leave your room. In this way, when you get downstairs, your car is waiting for you.Other Amenities: Laundry Room is on the 4th floor, for those that want to wash things. Remember, this laundry room is used by all hotel guess from both towers. Also located on the 4th is a Doctors office 鈥?good thing to know and remember. Shops 鈥?They have all sorts of Shops located on the lower level of the hotel 鈥?Very Expensive. Overall I think the Hyatt needs to spend some $$$ on some major renovations and upgrades. The staff and the Aloha Spirit is always present, which made my trip enjoyable. ',POOR,
'If price is right, great place to stay We stayed for four nights in June. We thought the location was great - right across the street from the beach with no buildings on the beach side of the street. We got a great deal on a package that included 3 nights for the price of 4 and a wonderful breakfast buffet for 2. (If you're a family, you have to pay for the kids. Buffet expensive if you pay - $12 for kids under 13 and $24 over but you can get breakfast off the menu cheaper). They provided a rollaway free of charge; you could get use of beach chairs and towels free of charge at the pool area. Pool very small but never crowded. It's in a great place for walking around Waikiki. Their parking garage is stressful to get in and out of and not cheap but is immediately across the side street and you can get valet parking, if you want to pay higher daily rate. The room was nice and bigger than many hotels. If I could get a similar rate, I'd definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Very comfortable hotel We (husband and I) spent ten days at this hotel, having stayed there previously a number of times in the 1980's with our children. We were curious to see whether it had maintained the standards previously experienced. We found the room very comfortable, particularly the feather pillows (big tick for this), though would have felt that supplying coffee with the coffee maker in the room would have been a welcoming touch. The hotel setting is quite attractive with a central atrium with a waterfall and plants, little coffee and snack bar for impromptu snacks and coffee (not Hyatt's, just one of the shops in the atrium). The hotel is just across the road from the beach and also the trolley stop. We ate at the Ciao Mein Restaurant, food was very good here. One comment about the maid service, rooms seemed to be made up at random times, any time from 9am to after 1pm.The breakfast setting is most attractive, however the buffet breakfast lacked any sort of bread or toast apart from mini bagels, or on one occasion French toast. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel, and would stay again. ',GOOD,
'A Class Act, a great place to stay       Lobby ',GOOD,
'Very Nice Rooms -not so nice Lobby We really liked this hotel. The first impression can be deceiving, and quite frankly, we didnt like the reception/entrance in this hotel, it has an Old Vegas Hotel feel with Shopping Mall included -worn carpet, noisy electrical escalators and elevators, too many stores, and all- (and in the middle of Waikiki! how bad could that be!) ... BUT, once we got to our room it was a whole different story, the room was newly remodeled, the decor was very nice, Hawaiian style but not cheesy (kind of zen) and had a big nice marble sink outside the bathroom which is always convenient. Our room had a balcony with a city/mountain view which was very nice too. Ask for a quiet room, some can be noisy facing the main avenue or pool area.The pool is very very small, so if you plan to spend time in the pool and hotel grounds you might be better off trying the Hilton Hawaiian Village which has lots of pools and green manicured lawns. The only thing we enjoyed about this hotel's pool area, were the wooden rocking chairs that overlook Waikiki, MUCH NICER VIEW than the overrated rocking chairs in the Shearton Moana (which face the street!), plus the Hyatt has live hawaiian music in the evening, so its pleasant to look down at the action in Waikiki and rest for a moment there after returning your towels. There are 2 small jacuzzis around the pool too, (usually full)Buffet bkfast is ok, not great, so if you get it included in your nightly rate its worth it, if not try different places instead. (We heard great reviews about brunch at Orchids Restaurant in Kahala Mandrin Hotel, but didnt go since we got bkfst included at Hyatt)We didnt spend much time at the hotel, and when we did it was only in the room so for us it was perfect. Service from all the staff was excellent, very friendly and accomodating. Every time we needed extra towels they came in a matter of minutes and we got a free champagne bottle for our anniversary, which was very nice!!!Valet parking is an extra $19 per night ($15 self park), internet $10 for 24hrs connection, room safe $4, so add all this in to your bill.The hotel is not ON the beach, but you can cross the street and be in Waikiki in a second. The pool lends you beach towels and chairs which is a really nice perk. There are several ABC stores in the hotel to get water, snacks, etc so you dont spend money getting snacks from the fridge.If you can, splurge rent a convertible and drive around the island, there are some great, less touristy beaches on the East and North sides of the island and you can take your towels and go beach hopping. If you can pack a colapsable/flexible thermo case for your water and drinks, its very handy to take to the beach. You can fill it w/ice at the hotel.Hike up Diamond Head crater for great views of Waikiki, Honolulu, and the East Coast.Duke's at the Outrigger is overated, we went there one day and saw COCROACHES on the floor around our table several times, I know its the beach and its warm but its very yucky to see that when you are having dinner, in any case just go for a quick drink to check it out.So in summary: if you want a really nice room, in a good location and dont plan to spend too much time in the hotel/pool/etc then stay here,,,, if you are looking for a 'beach hotel' experience in Waikiki, then maybe try the Hilton Hawaiian Village.Have a great time! ',GOOD,
'Great service! Stayed just one night at the end of April. The service was very good. I used my mileage points and had a city view room reserved. We arrived around noon and they let us check in early, I asked for a view room and because one was available they gave it to me no add't. charge. Valet service was a little slow when busy but overall the hotel was very pleasant and the service was above average. The room was a little worn but clean and the beds comfortable. Would stay again for sure. ',GOOD,
'We had a wonderful time! My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki from April 16-23. We arrived Sunday at noon so our room wasn't ready but the front desk kept our baggage and provided us with a pager. We then had lunch overlooking the ocean at the Elegant dive and relaxed with a cocktail while the room was being prepared. We were paged and went to check in. We had received a complimentary room upgrade to partial oceanview...the only downer was that all POV rooms have 2 doublebeds. Ah well, more cozier that way. The front desk felt bad and gave us a $50 credit to our room. The room was very elegant and well furnished. We actually had a handicapped unit and I think that gave us more room. The bathroom was huge! Overall the staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and make us feel welcome. Everyone was so nice! Also we had complimentary breakfast buffet every morning which was quite tasty as well. We ate at their Japanese restaurant once...the food was good. We also ate at Ciao Mein where we had the best caesar salad, a great meal and great service. We were able to book all of our tours through the expedia desk which made things convenient. Any shopping needs were onsite or nearby. The pool was small but refreshing:it never felt overcrowded and loungers were always available. Watching Hawaiian performers while sitting in the raised hottubs overlooking Waikiki in the evening was the best. We loved our stay there! ',GOOD,
'Good for Waikiki The first night we got there, the hotel gave us a a room with separate beds. You can imagine we were not happy considering it was our honeymoon. The next day, they gave us another room with partial ocean view.The location is great if you want to stay in the Waikiki area. The beach is literally a few steps away. Some of the fast food places are nearby as well. However, Waikiki is very noisy and is a lot like Miami Beach. We stayed back in April 2005.The hotel is nice overall. ',POOR,
'The Regency Floor is great.......that's about it I have been using Tripadvisor many times and now I can do my own review. We just returned from Hawaii where we stayed for 4 days.As another reviewer mentioned it is worth it to say on the regency floor. The folks there were very nice and helpful. The breakfast is a great way to start the day and in the evening the drinks are free flowing. ( did I mention it is all included in the price) The hotel itself is ok. I did book the Royal Hawaiian and also the Sheraton Moana Surfrider but cancelled because of different reviews. We droped by these hotels and I wish we had booked there. They have much more charm and activity by the pool and on the grounds. The Hyatt is attached to a mall if I can call it that and the pool is tiny. It is kind of sad. The fellow there told me they have allot of Japanese stay there and they are not big on drinks by the pool or the sun. I wonder why they go to Hawaii. (to each his own) The only saving grace ws the regency floor. I was there with my wife and 2 kids. We are not big party people but it is nice to people watch by the pool and perhaps strike up a conversation with others. It was plan to see that it would not happen at the Hyatt. The Royal or Shearton has that feel. I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando and it would put this place to shame. If you want a place to sleep and just head out from this is your place but if you want to see it all pick another place. It ws better than Toronto at that time of year ( ha ha ) ',POOR,
'Go for the regency club--worth extra $$$ My husband and I stayed here and the staff, amenities and hotel made it one of the best vacations we've ever taken. The service was attentive, the rooms and grounds breathtaking. What an amazing view of the ocean to wake up to every morning! Lastly, booking at the Regency Club level meant a room in the top 6 floors with ocean view as well as buffet breakfast every morning AND cocktails and happy hour snacks (like chicken wings, kalua pork, shrimp) every night! ',GOOD,
'Disappointing Second Visit We stayed here in September, 2005, and I raved about this hotel. It had been such a great experience that we decided to go back again in January. What a disappointment on this trip. I booked EXACTLY the same room type (ocean view) and when we checked in, we were told that we were being upgraded (?) to a deluxe ocean view from our mountain view. I never booked a mountain view-- I live in Las Vegas and am surrounded by mountains, I don't need a mountain view on vacation, I want an ocean view. Anyway, this deluxe ocean view was only an ocean view IF you went on the lanai and hung your head to the left.Our view was of the Sheraton Moana Surfrider. To add insult to injury, we were only on the 5th floor and the band playing near the pool kept us awake until midnight. In addition, two days later, as we relaxed in the room watching TV, we heard bubbling noises coming from the bathroom. We went to check it out, and the toilet bowl was bubbling with water as if Moana Loa was beginning to erupt. We called maintenance and he said he believed it had to do with air in the plumbing system and called the front desk to change our room. Our room change to room on the ninth floor and was not much better, still overlookign the pool bar and its noise and our view of still of the Sheraton. The bathroom was a mess to say the least. The fixtures in the bathtub were actually coming out of the wall, however, I was not going through another room change. I cannot understand how this hotel has declined within the four months since we were there. We went to the Sheraton Moana on Saturday night for a beautiful 鈥淧romise Me Again鈥?ceremony. Here we were each gifted with fresh orchid lei, a beautiful marriage vow renewal ceremony and certificate. This was free of charge and we were not even guests of the Sheraton. Upon our check-in at the Hyatt, we were not even so much as offered a cold glass of water. Speaking of cold water, when we were on the fifth floor, the ice machine was out of order and anytime we needed ice, my husband had to take the elevator to an upper floor to get it. This is ridiculous when we are paying for a room at the Hyatt and not at the Holiday Inn. My husband told an employee that happened to be near the ice machine on the fifth floor and he said that they knew about it. The next day, I called housekeeping who had no idea of the problem was going to report it to the proper person.Except for the personnel at the Terrace Cafe and the housekeepers who cleaned our room in a very timely manner, we felt totally unwelcomed at this hotel.When we were there in September, we were up on the 22nd floor, and I believe that this made all the difference. So if you decide to stay at the Hyatt, make sure you request a room on a high floor.In the defense of the Hyatt, I must say that I wrote to the hotel manager as well as the CEO of the Hyatt Corporation and received an apology letter with two free nights, which we will use at the Hyatt in Maui in December. The first part of our vacation in Waikiki will be spent at the Sheraton Moana, a truly grand hotel. ',POOR,
'Well Worth the $$$ I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights this past February 2006 for business and was quite pleased. As with many high end hotels, you don't get the free continental breakfast, free high speed internet, or free parking but you do get clean rooms, great service, and lots of ammenities. The view from my 32nd balcony was great! I had a view of the ocean and the city. The beach was right across the street and the mainline trolly was right outside. I highly recommend this hotel for the distinguished traveler who has high standards. My hats off to the many workers at the hotel! ',GOOD,
'Very pleased       Our room (photo taken toward the lanai) ',GOOD,
'Just alright! We stayed here for our honeymoon. We had an ocean view room but were very disappointed with the room itself. It seemed very outdated and wasn't really very clean. Definitely not worth the money paid, would have rather stayed at the Four Seasons. Room wasn't very appealing, would not stay here again. ',POOR,
'Worth the extra money!! My family and I stayed in the Hyatt Waikiki Resort in July 04' and loved it. It was definitely worth the extra money to be right in the middle of everything. Upon arriving we were disappointed that there was a twenty minute line to wait in to check in. Though once we got to the front we were greeted by a very friendly front desk employee that let us know that we could earn frequent flyer miles with out stay and that if we signed up for their free 'Passport' hotel point system we got free access to the gym. The room was okay sized and had a Hawaiian theme to it. The view was unbelievable. I definitely recommend the side view of the ocean rather than the rooms that directly face the water. From our balcony we could see the coast line for miles and down below we could see the daily free luau on the beach. I am not one of those people who like to sit on the front porch in the evening, though I can honestly say I sat on that balcony for hours a day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Do not even try the pool or Jacuzzi. They are tiny considering it is a 1,200 room hotel. They are also filled to the brim with screaming kids. Do yourself a favor and use the warm ocean across the street. I did however enjoy their gym (which as mentioned above was free with their point card). The gym did not have and weights and only had around ten machines though the gym was never busy. I especially liked their sauna. The only problem I found with the hotel was the price for parking ($10 a day). Every time you wanted to take our car out of the garage you have to wait in line at the front desk and pay an additional $10 to get a ticket to get out. Unfortunately, I did not find out till the day before I left you could go to their convention center lobby (just up the escalator near the garage elevators) and purchase the same ticket for just $3 from a machine. The other problem I saw was that there were prostitutes and drug dealers just across the street. Even though there is a police station across the street as well, this did not stop them. They only come out late and night and at no time did I ever feel unsafe. ',GOOD,
'Best of Waikiki After reading some negative remarks about this hotel, particulary from someone who didn't even stay here, I decided to write a review myself instead of just reading them. We stayed here for four nights in September, had a room with a beautiful ocean front view, and from the balcony could even see Diamond Head. The staff was welcoming and friendly and enriching our first trip to the Islands, so much so that we are returning in two weeks. The Terrace Grill breakfast that was included in our package was more than we could ask for considering that it was free. The convenience of having two ABC stores in the hotel was great and we NEVER had any reason to fear for our safety. The experience we had at the Hyatt was a fantastic one and we cannot wait to return in two weeks. ',GOOD,
'No complaints here! My husband says that I am a hotel snob, so I hope that this review will be helpful for other snobs out there. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt from 12/19 through 12/24 and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. We had a mountain view room in the Ewa tower on the 34th floor which gave us an excellent view of the city and surrounding mountains during the day and night. And, if I leaned over the balcony just a little bit, I could even see the ocean. Like previous reviews have said, we knew that the mini-bar would be a rip off so we brought a small portable cooler(it could collapse in our suitcase) with us, filled it with some ice, and went to the ABC store downstairs and bought water, juice, etc. to keep in the room.Our package came with daily buffet breakfast at the Terrace (which normally goes for $24/person). The buffet catered to various cultures, which provided an unique array of food for those who are daring. We were always greeted by friendly restaurant staff and the wait service was also excellent. They even obliged our requests to have our picture taken during breakfast. I would also suggest that folks check out the Hyatt spa. My husband, (initially) begrudgingly agreed to do a couples massage with me. Although expensive (but comparable to Hyatt spas elsewhere), he was thanking me afterward and it was definitely worth it.Yes, the pool is small. Yes, you will probably need to get there by 10am (11am at the latest) to get a nice spot, but it is decent and you can easily relax there. The Mai Tai and Blue Hawaii drinks are good and it was 80 degrees in December. I am not complaining.Overall, we had a great time and would recommend the Hyatt to everyone we know. We can't wait to go back!!Aloha! ',GOOD,
'I was assaulted here A word of advise: Be careful while walking in this area, violent crime is not unknown in these parts. My wife and I were attacked by some drug crazed local on Kalakaua avenue right in front of the Hyatt hotel while the hotel security stood idly by and did not lift a finger. We took refuge inside one of the ground level stores and called 911 thinking that police would show up instantly seeing as there is a police station half a block down the street. Sadly, no, it took the police more than half an hour to come and when they came, the two officers begun making small talk with the store clerk, all the while the individual who attacked us was probably close by. Both officers appeared really clueless but managed to give me a case number and, after admitting that this kind of thing does happen, departed the store 鈥榠n search鈥?of the attacker. Never heard from them again and it鈥檚 been two months since ',POOR,
'Great trip! When we arrived at the hotel, we were pleased with the beauty of the lobby and the close proximity to the beach. As it turned out, the hotel had overbooked and asked us if we wanted to give up our room for one night in return for for some cash and breakfasts and an upgrade from our city view to ocean front the rest of the week. We accepted the deal and ended up at the Sheraton on the beach across the street for our second night. Simple enough for us to pack a bag for one night. This allowed us to realize just how nice the Hyatt was. We couldn't wait to get back. The service at the Sheraton paled in comparison to the Hyatt. People just went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt. People at the Sheraton didn't give a damn. From the bellhops to the maids to the front desk managers, everyone was awesome at the Hyatt. I will try my best to stay there again if I stay in Honolulu.Breakfast at the Terrace was so nice every morning with good food ang a great view. The pool was small but the kids loved it. The nachos were not too good but the drinks were OK.The location is awesome. My son and I loved walking at night watching the street performers and shoppping at the international market. Everthing you could imagine is walking distance. We drove our convertible (definately recommended for the views) all over the island.What a great trip. Thanks Hyatt. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel and Location...very happy Honeymooners I came on here quite few times to read reviews and some made me very nervous. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt from Oct 23-26 for the first part of our honeymoon and we were very happy. The Hyatt is extremely beautiful and the location of the hotel is great. Yes its busy but this is Waikiki and there are TONS of tourists around. The valet and the front desk staff were beyond attentive and extremely polite and sweet. Our room was gorgeous. We stayed in the Ewa tower and the room wasn't huge but it wasn't as small as I expected. We had a partial ocean view on the 34th floor but it might as well have been ocean front. Our balcony view was of Waikiki beach, and Part of Diamond head, we saw the Diamond tower as well but that is to be expected in Waikiki since there are so many high rise hotels. The staff were all courteous and everyone always greeted us with a smile and an aloha. They delivered champagne to our room the first night and we ate at Colony the first night as well were they put us at a great table and gave us free dessert. There is great music at the bar by the pool and the stores inside are great and reasonably priced. Yes the pool isn't huge but it was never crowded and they give towels and beach chairs to use on the beach. The only thing we weren't thrilled with was the buffet breakfast included in our package. The food was good but there wasn't a huge array. All in all we were very happy with the Hyatt and would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'5star hotel at 4star prices my wife and I just returned after spending 8 days at the Hyatt.The room on the 22nd floor was spacious and extremely clean. the ocean view was awesome. The staff was courteous and professional. The pool is small but quite inviting. The pool area has plenty of chairs with shade. We sat on the beach every other day and were provided with beach chairs and towels at no extra charge. You can spend a lot more money across the street for a smaller room with an indifferent staff. If this hotel is good enough for Perillo tours than its good enough for my family. ',GOOD,
'Average Hotel Great Location if you like Crowds I was in Honolulu on business and the stay here was average. The best thing about the hotel is the sushi bar. GREAT sushi and the sushi chef is really friendly. The gym at this location is one sorry excuse for a gym. They do allow you to go to the 24 hour fitness a block away but there is a nominal fee. If you like crowds and you are looking for a beach... its great. The beach in front of the hotel is packed after 7:30 am and remains packed until sunset. If you walk down the beach four or five blocks... you can find empty areas of sand where the locals hang out. I dont think I would stay here if I were paying for a hotel myself, I just dont care for large crowds at a beach. The parking garage is crazy... VERY crowded and it is hard to get in and out of the garage. The room was average. The staff... not so friendly... they need a bit of the aloha spirit injected into them. ',POOR,
'Good but not great Just returned from spending 8 nights here at the Hyatt. I visit Honolulu at least once a year and normally stay at less expensive hotels. This time I decided to go on the spur of the moment and the Hyatt was the only hotel available. I chose a deluxe oceanfront room since I was splurging this time. I really expected something spectacular. The room on the 35th floor was nice and very clean but small---especially the bathroom. The view was incredible. DEFINITELY beware of hidden charges. Most of the cheapie hotels I stay in over there have a microwave, fridge, coffeemaker, etc. In-room coffee cost $1.50 for ONE CUP. We paid $12 to rent a fridge. THe staff was wonderful throughout the hotel. The food was good. We ate breakfast every morning at the Terrace Grill.The worst thing about the hotel is the ridiculous size of the pool. It really is about the size of a really nice home pool. For a hotel as large as the Hyatt, this is a mystery. The chairs are very comfy and the pool service is wonderful, but by 10 AM the pool is full of squealing children.The huge waterfall is gorgeous, but it is almost impossible to find somewhere to sit to enjoy the view. We finally found a few padded chairs. Most of the lobby furniture is extremely uncomfortable. I would stay here again, but if I wanted to go upscale or high moderate, I would definitely prefer the Sheraton or the Royal. In fact, as far as pool and amenities go, I even prefer the Outrigger Reef!!!! ',GOOD,
'Hyatt Waikiki       View from Regency Club ',GOOD,
'Good Hotel...very average but ok.       view from our room...city view ',POOR,
'Nothing Unusual! View is great and location is convenient. If you like city life, this is the hotel for you.Otherwise, I do not see this hotel any special at all. This is the old breed of hotel. The guest room and bathroom are small. Actually, they are really small. The location is very noisy even we stayed at high floor. It is not just the street noise. You can hear the wind whistle all the time. Police station is across the street so you might feel safe but the siren can be heard all night. I guess it is common among the hotels in Waikiki area.Watch out all the hidden charges. Even using the coffee machine is chargeable. Parking is tough to find at hotel garage. Again, you have to be very good driver in order to drive inside the garage because the drive way is so narrow. You might have to use valet parking sometimes because you can not find a parking spot inside the garage. By the way, the amount of daily parking fee is depended on how you book this hotel. You might want to discuss this fee with your travel agent if you decide to stay at this hotel. The range can be from free to $15 a day. I paid maximum $15 a day because I bought a vacation package from Expedia.Swimming pool is small and crowded. Beach is only across the street. However, the beach is pretty popular, also. Spa and fitness center are really good. Again, the fitness center are not free, either and it is kind of new to me. I have stayed at so many Starwood and Marriott resorts. It is the first time that I have to pay daily fee to use the fitness center. Luckily, they do not charge you for using the pool.We smelled cigarette smoke in our room one day even though we stayed at smoke-free floor. It seemed that management at Hyatt did not care at all after we complained it to the front desk. Anyway, it is our first time staying at Hyatt. Maybe we should stick to Starwood hotels which are nearby and look better. ',POOR,
'Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! This is THE place to stay! We were here for 7 nights before going on to Kauai. Absolutley the right place to be. So many of the hotels are away from the beach even though they say they are close. If you like the nightlife and the people watching this hotel is centrally located on the main drag. We loved eating beakfast in the open air cafe. So many things to do and see all within walking distance. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The view from our room was awesome! Can't say enough...Perfect! ',GOOD,
'Hyatt Regency great location great hotel! Just spent 4 nights at the hotel, got a fantastic room with an ocean view.Location is across the road to the main beach, heaps of shops everywhere.Staff friendly and helpful as well as porters! Ciao Mein restaurant world class. Swimming pool small but service excellent around pool, but beach is best anyways! Will be always staying there when we go back to hawaii! ',GOOD,
'Very Nice Hotel We just returned from 5 nights at the Hyatt. It was really beautiful and very clean. Everything is expensive but we expected that. We had no problems at all with this property. ',GOOD,
'Enjoyed our time at the Hyatt This was our first trip to Hawaii and we were very happy with our stay at the Hyatt! The location can't be beat -- right in the heart of Waikiki! We stayed in the newly renovated Ewa Tower and had no problems with our room. The maid service was great -- our room was always cleaned by the time we returned from our day every afternoon and it always smelled wonderful -- like flowers! Our package included free parking and breakfast everyday, which was nice since Hawaii is already expensive enough. Eating breakfast outside every morning at the Terrace Grill was such a nice start to our day. The pool is definitely a little small, but we didn't hang out there much anyways. The many ABC stores inside the hotel were very convenient for snacks, sunscreen, etc.The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Can't wait to go back! My wife and I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Resort  Spa for a 4 nights and have to say that our stay was excellent. The hotel is in an ideal, central location and rooms are spacious and comfortably appointed. The pool is a little small but adequate. We found the staff helpful, corteous and professional at all times. My wife tends to be pretty big on personal presentation and was impressed, even making note of the fact that female staff were profesionally attired in regulation pantyhose, something fairly uncommon at resort style hotels. On another occasion we needed some advice on tours, restaurants and neighbouring islands and everyone we dealt with went out of their way to assist us. We will definitely stay at the this hotel on our next visit to Oahu. ',GOOD,
'Far below the usual Hyatt standards We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki March 14 to March 19 2005. The location was perfect and the ocean view amazing. Our room was spacious but needed urgent renovation, whereas the bathroom was too small and dark. The quality of breakfast was low, as compared to usual Hyatt standards. We had problems with getting ou room cleaned and there was a lot of noise at night. D.Tsambaos ',POOR,
'Great experience Location was perfect, directly across the street from the Waikiki Beach Center. Our room was on the 40th floor with a mountain view. Room was very large and very clean. Service was excellent and everyone seemed to really cater to us. Ate at Ciao Mein and the Terrace Grill. Both were very good, yet pricey. Pool is quite small, but the cocktail waitress and pool attendants provide exceptional service! Overall, a very nice 6 night stay! ',GOOD,
'Great Views My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Hyatt and it was wonderful!!! The rooms were spacious and clean. The staff was very accomodating by checking us in two hours earlier than the standard 4pm. We were even able to upgrade to an ocean view. Our money was well spent. ***Hint*** If at all possible use your AAA discount to get free breakfast at the hotel's restaurant and free valet parking if your stay is 4 days plus. ',GOOD,
'Hyatt Regency Waikiki was a super choice!! We stayed at the Hyatt Waikiki April 4 thru April 12th. After debating which hotel to stay we were delighted to have made the correct choice of the Hyatt. Extremely clean hotel and very pleasant, efficient and helpful staff throughout our stay. We had the special which included the buffet breakfast for two every morning at the Terrace Grill. Great selection and always hot and fresh. Lovely seating outside and all staff eager to wait on us and refill our drinks. Location, location, location!! Could not be a better location than Hyatt Waikiki. Directly across from Dukes status and a very short walk to ocean and sand! The police station right across the street was comforting too. The Elegant Dive for late afternoon cocktails and evening entertainment was fun. Paz and Jody our bar waitresses really paid attention to all the Elegant Dive guests and always added fresh fruit and orchids to our drinks. Too fun!! Lots of personality from the Elegant Dive staff. The hotel even provides beach chairs and towels to take across to the beach. Tammy(pool attendant) was very helpful and offered many services to us. The valet parking was very efficient and complimentary if you stayed at least three nights(no problem). Lots of shopping right on Waikiki and good maps and directions given by all staff. Kelly checked us in very efficiently and even remembered us several days later when she saw us at front desk. Hotel has a late check out for $50.00 additional which was perfect as our flight did not leave HNL until 1000 p.m. so we could enjoy beach, pool and sun all prior to our plane departing for home. The maid service excellent and always fresh and clean. She even straightened our shoes every day!! No question, we will stay at Hyatt Regency Waikiki when we return to the island of Oahu. Thanks again all of the staff at Hyatt!! ',GOOD,
'Hyatt Waikiki - waste of money We stayed at Hyatt Waikiki in Late August 2004 for our honeymoon (just found out about this website yesterday). The hotel decor is ok, location is good across the street from the beach and close to shopping and restuarants. Other than that the hotel was terrible. The pool was exteremly small and not at all what was pictured in the brochure (brochure pictures the spa, which is expensive, buyer beware) It was overrun by rude, Japanese tourists, breakfast was the same day after day and was geared more to the Japanese tourist than the average american tourist. Our oceanfront room was terrible. The ocean view was obstructed by palm trees and the band from the patio could be heard loud and clear at all hours even though our door was shut The walls in our bathroom shook every morning at 5am, but no one could tell us why. We requested the tower with no construction and were put on the 5th Flr. The towels has stains on them everyday and one night I found blood on our bedsheets!!!! I called to front desk to have them changed and it took them over 30 min to come to room with clean sheets, when they arrived they brought 1 sheet, not the whole bedding as I had requested. The day we were to check out, bell hop entered our room without permission, even though there was a do not disturb sign on the door and took our luggage and placed it outside on the curb. Our luggage was wide open and not sealed with $$ on top sitting on the curb on waikiki beach waiting to be picked up. I ran to the front desk and demanded to see a manager while my husband hunted down our luggage. No one seemed to care that our room was entered (A SERIOUS security/personal safety concern!) and the manager was busy. I waited over 25min to get a manager and he could of cared less. He atitude was so go find it yourself its outside. He offered absolutely no apoligy and did not care, the hotel staff did not care either. Needless to say a teriible experience overall, not a good way to start a marriage after you have flown for 13+ hours. There are tons of hotel on the Waikiki strip, do yourself a favor and find a different hotel! ',POOR,
'Nice, great, wonderful stay!!!!! Two of my friends and I stayed at the Hyatt from 2/10-2/18 2005 and we loved our stay. The hotel is pretty big so we got a little lost a few times, but its not hard to learn your way around. I loved the waterfall and all the shopping. My birthday was on the 12th so we went to Kelly Slaters birthday party!!!! That was being held at the Hyatt on the same floor as the pool/bar. It was soo fun! The breakfast there was pretty good and other restaraunts weren't far. Our room had an ocean view that was to die for. We spent a lot of time on the balcany. It was also clean and the service was pretty good. I would love to stay at the Hyatt the next time I visit Hawaii. ',GOOD,
'Had a wonderful time! We stayed at the HR Waikiki from March 19th through the 25th, in a Regency Club Ocean View room. All I can say is that it was wonderful. The room was very clean, but we never saw a maid. A previous reviewer made the comment on the smell of the rooms. This is true, the room smells like fresh flowers every time you walk in. The only restaurant we ate at was the Terrace Grille, and it was great. The prices were not that high, and the food quality was good. I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel. Anything we asked for, we received. We even called down at 10:30 one night wanting beach towels for an early outing the next day, and had the towels to our room within 5 minutes. The staff in the spa was very polite and professional. The valet was very fast, even though they were swamped all the time. The hotel even waived our valet fee at the end of the week. I didn't even have to ask. Again, I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, and the staff that works there. We will definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Had a great time!       The beach directly across from the hotel ',GOOD,
'GREAT LOCATION I stayed March 9 - 14 2005...the hotel is very nice. If I had any complaints, it would be, the pool was always cold, and I had to call every time for more towels. Of course with 4 women in a room, we were always out of towels. It was quite confusing getting around with 4 entrances into the hotel, but overall, it was great. I did the spa, and had a seaweed wrap....it was great...98.00 but my sister paid for it for my birthday gift.There is a pub crawl that starts at the Dawg House bar in the international market center. It is 50.00, they do 5 bars but only one drink per bar is included. They shuttle you around, and it is a good time, I have done it 3 times over the years, and they always have 60-80 people on this crawl every time. They only do it on certian days, so check it out. The things to do there that is a must is, Pearl Harbor, hiking Diamond Head, Snorklin, and shopping......have a great stay ',GOOD,
'Ahh...a match made in heaven... It has been one year since we visited the hotel for our honeymoon, and on our one year anniversay, after popping open the bottle of complementary champagne they gave us one year earlier, we promised each other to get back as soon as we can...if you are looking for romance, you got it here. If you are looking for fun, this hotel is in the middle of it all (which means MILDLY busy until 10: if noise is an issue, move up to higher floors...but isn't the activity why you want to be in Waikiki?). If you are looking for convenience, this hotel sits across the street...let me repeat that, across the street from one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Highlights from the hotel: great service for such a huge facility: all requests were quickly handled. The food on site is awesome (albeit a little pricey...worth the money for a 7 layer cheesecake though)...the pool isn't huge, but news flash, the pacific ocean is. Every morning we woke up we went to our balcony and looked out onto the ocean. Where there was a concentration of boats we would focus our attention and from our room could make out the leaping of whales. Hmm...need I say more? If you are traveling to the most beautiful place on Earth, don't go cheap and stay in a room that is damp and smelly like we hear from so many others on this web site: spend a little bit more and enjoy delicious breakfast inside or on the outside deck among singing birds and soothing waterfalls! And if you need any more reason to go here...look at the pictures and realize that our personal pics are almost exactly the same: I'm no professional. Rub your eyes, it really is that beautiful! ',GOOD,
'An Average Experience, but one big plus!! I must admit, I was a tad disappointed once I opened the door to my room; expecially after walking through an INCREDIABLE and MYSTICAL lobby. The rooms were VERY average. I was very disappointed in the bathroom as it was small and the tile was old and worn; but hey it's a bathroom :) I agree with other reviews in that you could still smell that stale, old smoke smell w/in the rooms. Not too mention, I was in the tower that was already remodeled. Be prepared to pay and pay A LOT for everything too. The mini-bar is a rip-off ($4.50 for water) and you have to pay for paper thin slippers. Hey, the prices provided me worth a chuckle, so I guess it was worth it even though I didn't dare open the mini-bar.The location was great and the room view amazing as it was a deluxe ocean front. The hotel is close to everything, which makes it very convenient.The big plus was the hotel allowed us to use a hospitalily room for an hour to shower and prepare for our flight home. Check out was 12:00pm and our flight was not until midnight. When I explained this, the staff was more then willing to let us come back, shower, change clothes etc. A nice added touch considering we had a 14 hr flight to Rhode Island ahead of us. At past 4/5 star hotelsl in Hawaii, I was forwarded the opportunity to pay for an extra night or shower by pool if needed (in bathing suit of course). Thus, I found this offer by Hyatt quite advantageous.Oh and one other thing Americans should note. You WILL BE a minority in this hotel. The hotel caters to the Japanese. Thus, if you are looking to stay where many Americans are, this is not the place.Hope you enjoy your stay in Hawaii. Remember to just take time to sit and smell the air....it is amazing! Aloha!!! ',POOR,
'Its A Very Nice Place To Stay MY Husband and I stayed at the hayatt regency on wakiki beach well it was simply wonderful there from the food to the health spa's the service was excellent too also just one block away from the international market to shop at and directly across the street from the beach we were there when they had an zanbar barbaque and there were so many vendors selling foods of all kinds salads etc very good in fact lovely show was put on by the hawaiian children as well as music from the adults also while you are there try to go to a hawaiian loooul all the food you want is there too expensive but worth every penny there were lots of people there out every night shopping and all was very nice to see take plenty of money and shop till you drop eat all you can and have a wonderful time as we did and i advise anyone going there to atay at the hayatt regency hotel it will be a wonderful stay there. ',GOOD,
'Reservations, beware Wanted this to be a trip of a lifetime. Thinking a 5 star hotel of the Hyatt reputation would be perfect. Booked a room the first week of October for a weeks stay the second week of february. Through American Airlines sunshine on sale. Arrived at 6 PM only to be told they were overbooked. Wanted to move us for 2 days to another hotel. After some discussion we were allowed to stay that night. Moved to another hotelthe next day and then back again the day after. They offered a meal at the Colony Restaurant (very good) and $100 cash. On the second check in,people in line said they only booked a couple of weeks ahead. Front deskmanager would offer no explaination on how we were kicked out, only the overbooking excuse. Wasted time transfering between hotels and packing and repacking that took away from any activity. Would look elswere beforeconsidering the Hyatt ',POOR,
'Honeymoon Delight We stayed at the Hyatt for our Honeymoon in Sept. of 2004. We were very impressed with the service and the atmosphere! It was very clean, and inviting. For us the mall in the hotel was very neat. It was part of the hotel but did NOT put out noise. You still had the nice nights of sleep. We had a room that overlooked the ocean and WOW was it gorgeous. The tv does not face the bed which we weren't fond of since we watch tv before bed. However, wasn't a big deal. The pool is an average size maybe more smaller than average. You had to get there kinda early to get a chair in most cases. The service down by the pool was GREAT! Plus, if you didn't get a chair the ocean is right across the street! We got a chair almost every day we were there and didn't have much of a problem. The beds were very comfortable. The housekeeping service was WONDRERFUL. They did not bother you but yet you had a clean room and fresh towels all the time! We were very impressed. We would stay there again for sure! Made for a great honeymoon. Our favorite was to sit on the balcony especially in the mornings and see the view and relax. We also liked the pool! Just know where your tower is. We ended up in the wrong one a time or two! No biggy, the time overall was great! You felt like you were a part of everything but yet had your peace. Very nice hotel. Above average! ',GOOD,
'One of the nicest hotels in Waikiki The Hyatt Regency was the very first hotel that I stayed in during my stay in Waikiki. I really loved the atmosphere that the hotel had and the rooms were spacious and every room had a beautiful view (as told by other hotel guests). I was lucky enough to of had a half ocean view and half city view which was amazing to watch when the sun was coming up and setting. There were a few things that I wish I didn't have to go through. For one you really need to know where you are going in order to find where you need to go (really confusing I know, but that is my point). You know in the movies where the hotel clerk gives directions to the elevators and you are in total amazment that a person can talk that fast and not get confused? Well that part of a movie occurs here. You need to know where your elevators are in order to find them, so don't get turned around cause you will end up in the other elevator to the other tower. (That happened to me and I knocked on the door in the wrong tower!). I ate breakfast in the restaraunt and it was delicious, but a little pricy. The hotel itslef is basically a mall so be prepared to walk at least a half a mile out of the hotel to get to the beach across the street! (Which is a major plus!). But overall out of the three times I have been to Waikiki, I always stop at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki and think back on the days when I was so exicted to be in Hawaii that everything was beautiful. So enjoy your stay in Oahu and I highly recommend Lanikai Beach, ask your travel agent for a map there. It is so beautiful but you need to know where to go. This is the beach where the swimsuit models go to get the pictures taken, so it is the best kept secret in Oahu, so don't spread it around to the annoying tourists! HAVE FUN! ',GOOD,
'No Hyatt Touch Small Pool Heart of Congestion Hello if you are headed here you are headed to the only Waikiki hotel this end with two jacuzzis! Now don;t run over from Starwood acroos the street or they will run you away! The pool however is no bigger than a standard pool table at your favorite arcade! Speaking of fun get ready to play the same games you do with the local supermarket in their Gold Passport program! See they give you a three page folio for a Three day stay with all these extra charges for in room coffee @$1.38 USD per cup! and a $20.00 breakfast buffet per person and a 3.50 safe charge and on and on. Don;t expect a concierge or knowledgeable staff they have retreated to the Expedia Fun! desk now if you are internet savvy you can save on activities by going to expedia.com but there is no one but Tommy at the desk that can explain the activities in detail to you. The staff looks to economize and take short cuts when ever possible. There is NO private beach! The fitness center is at a charge unless it is waived with Gold Passport membership and like Safeway supermarket you saved a whooping XXXX. Wow!I suggest using those Gold Passport points on Kauai not here. The carpet in the Diamond Head Tower headed for an April renovation is in shabbles and the rooms feature televisions that DONOT EVEN FACE THE BED! The shops are over priced as for the health spa make and keep an exact appointment. This is not a business hotel! Try the Marriott down the street. Oh for internet access there are a limited 6 slots available for the wireless service if you sit directly in front of the coffee shop! The wireless anywhere else does not work and truely does not exist, less than 100 rooms in the hotel (the twin towers!) have high speed internet. Now for the High twin towers -- yep as the wind rips thru each evening your balcony door on floors 10 and higher will shake rattle and roll and then the sirens start the police station is across the street. This hotel was the killer for my Hyatt Touch -- I have moved on to Hilton Hawaiian Village, Marriott and Outrigger! It is not a RESORT! It has lost it's touch and Hyatt has lost my favor! ',POOR,
'spent 10 days at the hyatt regency waikiki spent 1/23 05 to /3/05 at thehyatt regency waikiki. joined the regency club so i was on the 38th floor overlooking waikiki beach and got free buffet breakfast just about everything shopping beach restaurants was in walking distance. and if it wasn't spoke to the people in the regency club lounge and they had a limo drop us off and pick us up at no charge. this was without a doubt the best vacation e've ever had and can't wait to go back next year.the testeraunts in the hotel were good but not great ',GOOD,
'Very Very Surprised I go to Honolulu at least once a year on business and had had almost all bad hotel experiences. So I took a gamble on the Hyatt. Loved it. I found the room to be very nicely appointed. Great views. The beach is fine. If I'm going to lay on the sand, I'll go to the north or west shores. But, there is plenty to walk to in terms of food. Which, on business, by myself, was important. In fact, at sidewalk level there was a great sushi place. I got a roll and coffee for breakfast at the coffee place on the main level and that was fine. The pool? Exceptional. Above the fray and the teaming masses of humantity across the street. Loved the pool. Staff was exceptional. Would stay here in a heartbeat. ',GOOD,
'truly pleasant experience I brought my family to the Honolulu Marathon and stayed at the Hyatt for a week (Dec 9 thru 16). My training organization booked the Hyatt and that is why we stayed at this hotel. Perhaps if we went to Honolulu on our own, we would not have chosen this particular hotel, but it was an extremely pleasant experience. The lobby is incredible, but the rooms are nothing to write home about. We stayed in the Ewa Tower, which I was told had been recently rennovated, but it still seemed run-down. You could tell that, although it was a non-smoking room, there had definitely been smokers in there (a lot of them)! All of Honolulu is insanely expensive, and the hotel is no exception, but there are three ABC stores in the hotel itself where you can stock up on certain things so that you are not tempted to break into the mini bar. However, I was charged for things being removed which I had never taken (twice it happened)-- all that I had to do was call the guest services and the charges were promptly removed, but don't forget to check your room charges to see if you have any billings. Definitely us the valet parking. At $15/day, it is only $3 more than self-parking and they will take care of the headaches for you -- parking is a nightmare in Honolulu. Of course it ends up to be more than that with tipping, but they will have your car ready and waiting within minutes of your call.The hotel (as well as the rest of Honolulu) is CRAZY-busy right before the marathon, so unless you are in town for the event itself, you might want to book around it. I found the staff extremely willing to help in any way that they could and just really friendly. I think that, within their price range, the Hyatt is a pleasant hotel with an excellent staff and commitment to guest services. ',GOOD,
'THE HYATT WAS FANTASTIC!! This Hotel was not only fabulous, but had many ameneties that my husband and I look for in hotels. We only pack carry-on bags...so, a laundry room is a must! The Hyatt offers this and many more ameneties. I would HIGHLY recommend it. Oh, and we are going back there, again, next year!!! ',GOOD,
'Regency Club helps The restaurants are nothing to brag about -- the location is fine (as good as anything in Waikiki) -- the Regency Club room was quite comfortable (though the A/C was a bit difficult to regulate) -- and the food/drink perks on the Regency Club floor were well worth the small $$ upgrade. ',GOOD,
'Okay place... Stay in the Ewa Tower Pretty Nice hotel. You must request the Ewa tower when you check in. Our friends got put in the Diamond Head tower that has not been remodeled yet and had cheesy hawaiian bedspreads and smelled like mold. Also, for a while there, I was sure that I was visiting Japan. My advice... go the N. Shore where the Americans are or stay in Maui. ',POOR,
'honeymoon in hawaii, ohau We spend 8 days in ohau, pulled up to the hotel, they took our bags to the room and they parked the jeep. front desk is very friendly, helpful, and fast. Rooms are nice and very clean, needs new carpet. they are doing a remodeling soon, and that is good. breakfast buffet is good, fast seating, friendly people. tour desk at hotel is very friendly and helpful. we were on the 17 floor, could hear the cars and people on the road. but that is expected when you are on the strip in the city. great ocean view from the room. you have to pay for coffee in your room, my suggestion is to get the breakfast buffet every moring as part of your package and then you can have coffee and juice. plenty of shops at hotel. ABC store are good for your drinks and food. had a great time, would do it again! ',GOOD,
'Greast stay at the Hyatt We just returned from a week at the Hyatt. It was fabulous. I think it is the greatest location on the beach with a fabulous ocean front view. The staff was very friendly. The beach is just across the street and is great for surfing, body surfing, floating, just sitting on the beach and people watching. At night it is very pretty with torches lit all along the beach. It is a very friendly, relaxed atmosphere. It is expensive though. If I could go back I would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Disappointing and below Hyatt's standards My family and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki for 7 nights from Aug 6-13. Even though the location of this hotel is perfect-across from the beach and Duke's statue, we were disappointed because the rooms were sub-standard. The bathrooms were dingy and dirty. The rooms were decorated with cheap and out-datted furniture. The cleaning lady even forgot to come by during the middle of our stay. We were charged for items from the mini-bar even though we did not take them. This is an over-priced hotel that provides mediocre services and immenities. We had booked a vacation package with Expedia so we were unable to change to another hotel. Next time, we will definitely stay somewhere else ie, the Halekulani. ',POOR,
'Couldn't ask for more!!!! We stayed at the Hyatt for the last 5 days of our honeymoon. The staff was great, room was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom was great, nice closet, nice colors and furniture. Great pool/bar area. Right across the street from the beach. If I go to Waikiki again I would definately stay here. ',GOOD,
'Nice Hotel, But $$$ I just returned from a one week stay at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki. It is located right on the strip, across the street from the beach. It is a busy, bustling location, right in the middle of all the action. You can walk to many shops and restaurants with ease. We were in a newly remodeled room which was very nice. The granite bathroom countertop is lovely, as are the new curtains, rug and furnishings (kind of a Tommy Bahama-Ethan Allen feel). Extras are not included. Slippers are $4, a cup of single brew coffee is $1.50 (and not very good!) and the safe is $3 per day. The honor bar is costly. We had a refrigerator sent up to store our own drinks and water (yes, there was a charge for that too). The pool is nice, but very small for a hotel this size. It is usually packed, with no lounge chairs available (unless you go early or late). Many tourists were trying to use large rafts and beach balls in the pool, which we found amusing. Since the beach is across the street, perhaps the hotel felt only a small pool was necessary. There are nice wooden rocking chairs by the pool, that face Waikiki beach. It's nice to just sit in the chairs and people watch. You can see the surfers, the waves...very nice. There are also two hot tubs located next to the pool. The service was great - wonderful staff, helpful and professional. My only gripe is the nickel and diming where ammenities are concerned. Like other hotels in Hawaii, there is the feeling that this one certainly caters to the Japanese. I am Asian American, and was mistakenly spoken to in Japanese a few times (understandable, yet somewhat annoying). The breakfast buffet is mediocre, so if you are craving a yummy buffet in the morning, this one isn't it. All in all a beautiful hotel that is clean, offers great service and views, has wonderful shops (lots of stores) and is located right in the heart of town. Rooms were quiet at night. Waiting for the elevator can be time consuming, but overall, a nice place. The waterfall they have is especially pretty. ',GOOD,
'The gem of Waikiki In July I had my 5th stay at the Hyatt on Waikiki. Once again, I was not disappointed by the location or my room. The hotel is centrally located across the street from one of the best beaches in Waikiki. The beach provides one of the best beach experiences in Hawaii. The gentle surf combined with the spectacular view of Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head makes for the ideal experience of Hawaii. The hotel provides all the shopping and services a person needs to have an enjoyable stay. I love the pool area and the large rocking chairs that overlook the beach and pool. The area surrounding the Hyatt has become a bit seedier in the last few years--it felt a little less safe than in the past. The hotel does cater to the Japanese visitor, and I felt, as an American tourist like I was the foreigner. There is a charge for everything in the room--from the use of the wall safe ($3) to the in-room coffee. When you take it out of the refrigerator you are chared $1.50 for a single brew cup. Despite these nickle and dime charges for everything, my stay was enjoyable as usual and I would recommend it--to those with the cash to pay! ',GOOD,
'Nice hotel great location I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights and my husband and i enjoyed the stay very much room was nice we had a beautiful view and the employees were all very nice!! Will definetly stay there again! ',GOOD,
'Great Location Yes, the rooms we saw were a little worn, but the location can't be beat. As mentioned, the resort will be upgrading all of the rooms. After the upgrade, I think this will be one of the best upscale properties in Waikiki. We paid for a Mountain view and ended up on the 34th floor. However, many Mountain and City view rooms are next to the elevators. We could hear the elevator from the room so we asked to be moved right away. The Front Desk was accomodating and switched us to a better room on the 25th floor. The edges of the carpet in both rooms were frayed and the bathrooms are not opulent, but the location can't be beat. We dined at Terrace Grille for lunch. (Not great.) Also Caio Mein for dinner. (Weird concept: Chinese and Italian menu.) Having a block long mall as part of the hotel was great. There were many Japanese tourists in the hotel, but I liked the more international flavor they brought. I'd stay at the Hyatt again. ',GOOD,
'Japan or U.S.A. ? Stayed at the Hyatt Waikiki in Honolulu in May. Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and fantastic vieuw from the 33rd floor on Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. Just one small remark: hotel, and for that matter Honolulu, seems to be taken over by the Japanese. ',GOOD,
'Would stay at Hyatt again. We stayed there a few weeks ago. Yes, the rooms need some serious upgrading. Yes, the breakfast buffet could use some improvement. However, the staff was EXTREMELY helpful and very friendly to my family and in-laws. We would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Not up to Hyatt standards I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Waikiki many times over the years and have always felt that the facility itself is fantastic and a great location, however, the guest hallways and rooms are not up to Hyatt standards.I just completed another stay from 5/15 - 5/18 and the rooms are definitely in need of refurbishing. The good news is that they've announced a $14,000,000 refurbishment program. I used Hyatt Gold Passport points to upgrade to a Regency Club room and didn't think the points were worth it. The hallways are more nicely decorated (all the other floors should look like that) and there was not much difference in the room itself....just some marble around the sink area. The breakfast offerings in the Regency Club were fairly basic (cold cereals, fruit, bread, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc.) not up to what you would expect at resort/non-mainland clubs.Room service was prompt, however, service was spotty: one morning breakfast served without a table cloth and lacking ice water.The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. Hopefully, after a $14,000,000 renovation, the facility itself will match the staff's excellence. ',POOR,
'Great view from the 33rd floor We stayed on the 33rd floor and had an incredible view of Waikiki. The rooms are a little outdated. The furniture a little old. But we were hardly in our rooms anyway. Avoid the breakfast buffet! We had it included in our package and had to end up going elsewhere for breakfast every morning. The buffet had sausage, bacon, hard boiled eggs, miso soup, some fruit and small boxes of cereal. For 20/person this seems like a rip off. There's no toast, no bagels, no pancakes, no omlets. Which is what we eat for breakfast. ',POOR,
'Great Experience We stayed at the Hyatt for 10 nights this April. It was perfect. After reading other reviews I was concerned I would be in for a disappointment, but I truly kept my mind open, and was surprised as well as WOW'd. We have stayed at Hyatt's before, and know that the Regency Club level is a good fit for our family.(with all the snacks, drinks, etc) We stayed in the Diamond Head tower with ocean views of Waikiki, absolutely the best. The service was amazing. Mark, the concierge in our lounge made our trip complete. He made many arrangements, provided many suggestions and in such a wonderful and friendly way. We felt very comforted by this. Our room was always clean, fresh towels twice/day. The room size as well was larger than a typical hotel room which made it feel less cramped with a family of four. Our lanai was a very nice size with table and chairs. We never saw a maid or carts in the hallway. The size of this hotel is amazing, but we never felt crowded. Resturants great, the Japanese resturant(Musashi) was the kids favorite due to the chef preparing food at table and doing magic tricks. Shopping was another amazing aspect of this hotel. I have to say, the location on Waikiki beach is my favorite. We have 2 children, 9 and 7; between the hotel pool and ocean it was perfect. We also had free daily buffet breakfast in the Terrace Grill with our stay which was a nice start to the day. Overall, the Hyatt in Waikiki met and exceeded our expectations. It was a wonderful experience. ',GOOD,
'Good times, pleasant stay Stayed here for five nights, (April 15 to April 20, 2004) and had a fantastic time. We had an oceanview room, but it may as well have been oean front, because the way the towers are set up, we had a complete and unobstructed view of the beach. Great service and nice, clean, comfy rooms. The breakfast buffet is excellent, the staff is very friendly (especially housekeeping), and the hotel is in a great location. It made for a wonderful Hawaiin vacation. ',GOOD,
'Decent hotel with nice views I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 4 nights in March. The Sunshine on Sale promotion was a very good value -- 4th night free, room upgrage, and free breakfast buffet. Try to get a room that is higher up with at least a partial ocean view. OK, the extra few dollars charge each night for the room safe was annoying, but it's worth it to store your valuables. I recommend the Ciao Mein (Chinese/Italian) restaurant in the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Location was perfect but hotel room was kinda old.... I stayed at this hotel for 6 days in December of 2003. Hotel's location is just perfect....it's right in the middle of all the actions. However, I have to say I was pretty disappointed when I walked in to our room (Deluxe Ocean View on 36th floor). Bathroom was rusty, furniture were old...and colors didn't even match. Some of 'em has bluish tone (not the pretty kind) and others had brownish tone....all in the same room. I was glad that I didn't pay the going rate of about $400.00-450.00 for this room... I would have been so mad if I paid that much and got this kind of room. But the view from the top was just awesome. You can see Waikiki beach from your balcony....watch people surfing and stuff. I usually like staying at Hyatt but I don't think I would recommend Waikiki Hyatt to anyone...especially if they have to pay regular rate. ',POOR,
'Had higher expectations for a Hyatt We stayed here the first two nights of our 10 day honeymoon before visiting Maui and the Big Island. The lobby was very nice as were the common areas and the staff very friendly. Once you entered the hall from the elevator it was musty and not very clean looking. Our first room was unacceptable due to a stale smoke odor (we had requested non smoking in advance). Our second room was a little nicer with an ocean view but the room was not particularly well appointed. It just didn't feel clean. I guess I had higher expectaions for a Hyatt Regency. I had read this hotel was 4 diamond AAA rated. I would honestly say it would be lucky to get 3 diamonds. Because we were only there 2 nights we just dealt with it. Had our stay been longer, we would have moved to a different hotel. To give you something to base this review on, my husband and I are 30-40 ish and like nice accomodations, but don't have unrealistic expectations. ',POOR,
'Waste of Money The rooms are disguisting and a waste of money. The rooms belong in a motel. The room was old and dirty. The bed squeaked and the TV faced the Wall. I was so disapointed with the hotel that I was scheduled to stay there for three nights but moved to another hotel after the first nightl. Don't make the same mistake we did and stay at this hotel . I recommend the Moana Surfrider. Don't waste your money. ',POOR,
'A Clean, Classy Hotel With Low-Key Exotic Elegance I absolutely fell in love with this beautiful and tastefully appointed hotel in the heart of Waikiki. I especially fell for the awesome two-story waterfall in the open-air lobby! This was the selling point for me of a hotel stay in Waikiki. I found the room to be very quiet, large and well appointed with rattan type furnishings. The staff bent over backwards to be helpful and give good advice about restaurants, inter island travel and were very attentive to my needs. The hotel is unique for its open-air roof and its elegant designer jewelry shops and other nice boutiques that span blocks. The long hallways are decorated with beautiful Asian antiques and vases, statuettes, etc. Though the place is enormous, it doesn't have a big obtrusive hotel feel like some do. There are three very good restaurants in the hotel complex itself that serve good food and are easy to access. I also loved the parrots in cages that are placed throughout the corridors. I got a terrific and magnificent breakfast plan that included free unlimited buffet style Japanese and Continental breakfasts for two in my daily hotel price. I loved leaving the hotel and coming back to its elegant charms; also a very convenient across from the beach location! All in all a tremendous experience I would no doubt love to repeat very soon!

'Great location, Great staff and Great view!!!! My husband, my 2-year-old son and I stayed at this hotel the week of Christmas. The hotel was very nice, clean, and the staff was friendly. The pool was a tad on the small side, but clean. We had a great time there. They upgraded us to deluxe ocean-view room with complimentary breakfast buffet (normally is $20 per person) so it was nice of them. The view from the room was incredible. We will definitely stay there again. Thanks to Hyatt stuff for making our Hawaii trip enjoyable. ',GOOD,
'Had a great time - Thanks! Wow! We just came back from two wonderful weeks at the Waikiki Hyatt.When we arrived around noon on Sunday, the Brunch on the Beach was underway right in front of the hotel.Chris at check-in, listened to our ideal room request, and assigned us to a large non-smoking full ocean view room on the 22nd floor, overlooking the Duke Kahanamoku Statue. Our reservation was only for a more modest corporate rate, Mountain View room. He even gave us bottled water when we came back a bit before 3PM and waited for our room to be ready.That evening we called to get a lamp fixed and few other things sent up. All was taken care of cheerily and quickly.We enjoyed the restaurants and the people that work there. The presentation and quality are excellent, and the prices are more than reasonable, especially if you use the coupons/discounts available. The breakfast buffet changes a bit each day; I liked the fluffy Florentine eggs and tender teriyaki beef, especially.The hotel supplies complementary towels and chairs for the beach. Yes, the hotel pool is on the small side, but the ambiance and location are superb, and the really big pool (the beach) is only a few steps away.Every evening, after the torch lighting ceremony @ 6:30PM there was a one hour hula show on the beach with different groups performing each night, and there are movies on Sat/Sun nights a bit further along the beach. We could see all this from our room's lanai or we could be right there just by walking across the street.On our last day, we asked for a late checkout as our flight home was at 11 PM, but our room was needed for incoming guests. Betty arranged for us to have another room, just across the hall, for as long as we wanted that day, at no charge. The bellman brought up the keys for the new room and even declined the tip I offered him.When we were checking out, Chris noticed us and came by to give us very beautful and fragrant flower leis and to wish us ALOHA.The Hyatt is the heart of Waikiki, with staff that really cares. Mahalo! ',GOOD,

'Nice Room,Good Location Great loaction 2 blocks from Plaza Catalunya so perfect for sight seeing if you want to be near everything but dont want to stay around the noisy Las Ramblas.Airport bus 鈧? one way and stops at the end of the road (get off at the stop after Plaza Catalunya) The rate we got included breakfast which was served till 11am. The hotel was fine for a weekend break, would consider this hotel a good 3* then a 4*. ',GOOD,
'decent room, good breakfast, good location I will focus more on details, as major things are ok - such as location etc.I made reservation for a queen bed double room. Once i got to the hotel there was only 1 room available in the conditions required. The room was no larger than 12 sq meters, bathroom another 10 sq m. The window was facing a close building - 2 m away - so no possibility for natural light in the room. So I went to the reception and asked for another room, even with 2 separate beds (altough we were a couple). They offered us a room in the building right close to the hotel - an apartment building owned partially by the hotel. The room was actually a junior suite at 1st floor, nice large windows facing the street and pretty spacious - at least 40sq m. Pretty clean too - but i was interested only in the sleeping details of the room as staying in Barcelona in a hotel room was not my objective..:) The city is great - you feel you could stay out there day and night.The bathroom was pretty poor - the sink being clogged in my case. The bed sheets and towels need to be changed - as they are pretty old and probably over used - you could smell the extra chlor used for washing.The personnel was ok, they gave us directions and info requested - but nothing out of regular stuff.The breakfast was the best service of the hotel i think (except location). Very reach buffet with cold and warm dishes. Strongly recommend this buffet.The price for the room in this conditions is pretty high, but once again - location is the one that really matters. ',GOOD,
'good location, good rooms, nice personnel we had booked a double, which was changed to a triple the day before our arrival (located next door to the hotel main entrance).very friendly staff, excellent room (soundproof, good size, perfect bathroom).the location, close to the Gaudi houses and to the metro access, is perfect. ',GOOD,
'Location, Location, Location! 2nd visit to this hotel and once again an enjoyable stay. No its not a palace but its not a dive either. It is.....a busy, clean, extremely well located city centre hotel (which means the views are of other city buildings ! duh!) with friendly and helpful staff. This is an excellent base for anyone contemplating sightseeing in Barcelona...just off the Passeig de Gracia, about two blocks up from Plaza Catalunya. You can take the bus from the airport and walk up from the square or take the train and walk down a couple of blocks to the hotel. The train station on Passaig de Gracia links you to the main train station at Sants and is so convenient for visits to Girona, Madrid or even Parc Adventura (1hr 20mins). Be warned though if you want to go anywhere via the AVE fast train you must book in advance as they are extremely busy. Plenty of restaurants and tapas bars around the hotel and the shopping of passaig de Gracia 2 minutes away! Our air conditioning worked perfectly well...often too well and we had to turn it down! Room was cleaned dailly with a change of towels and bedlinen. Staff at reception were helpful as were those we had contact with at the bar. Can't comment on the food as we did not eat in the hotel...to many choices outwith! 5 mins walk to Ramblas, Gothic quarter and Bus Turistica Tour main stop in Plaza Catalunya. Basically this is a very well run tourist class hotel which could not be better situated if it tried. Why do people want 5 stars facilities etc for a 3 star price??? ',GOOD,
'Good location, hotel very average My wife and I just returned two days ago from a 4 night stay. We chose Barcelona for a short break because of very cheap Ryanair flights from Bournemouth, near where we live, and not having been to Barcelona before, we thought we should give it a try. Hotel first: Functional, clean, comfortable. Our room 204 on 2nd floor, overlooking street, bit noisy but what do you expect from a city hotel. Staff were always there and seemed to be doing their job well enough, I don't always expect bright, smiley faces, simple courtesy is good enough. Did not use the bar, never seemed that busy. Did not eat at the hotel either so, as you can gather, our requirements were for a hotel in a good location with a clean  comfortable room in which everything worked. We got that, although we do have a couple of gripes about the hotel. The walls are very thin. The couple next door were clearly (and in the lady's case very audibly) enjoying a romantic getaway (good for them) I just wish I hadn't heard it all. Also, on Thursday afternoon we heard a street protest and looked out of the window to find there were about 40 or 50 protesters with banners and leaflets, loudspeakers etc, protesting against the hotel! No idea why, so we went out and when we came back it was all over, my wife asked at reception if it was likely to happen the next day, and reception said in matter of fact fashion Oh no, it only happens on Thursdays - what's that all about? The real advantage of the hotel is the location - just north of the gothic quarter in the upmarket shopping and commercial district. A brisk 20 minute walk to the port, 5 minutes to the Placa Cataluyna, 10 minutes into the gothic area, and 15 minutes in pretty well any direction, safe streets, nice shops and some decent eateries, with close walkable access to some of Gaudi's finest to the north and north east.If you're still with me, our views of Barcelona: Big, noisy, with too much traffic (even La Ramblas has two way traffic with a pedestrianised main thoroughfare right down the middle, frankly a little tacky, don't really get what all the fuss is about), generally more expensive than we expected, overall not hugely impressed with Barcelona. Simple tapas lunch for two near the Picasso museum in guide recommended eatery, with two tiny glasses of house wine each, with coffee, 40 euros, not great either. Good steak dinner for two with bottle wine  coffee, 90 euros (try Viento del Plato, imported Argentinian aged steaks). Gothic quarter is quaint enough with its alleys and squares, but no more so than many southern European historic centres. North of the gothic quarter is laid out in a block pattern, USA style, with wide avenues and streets, designer shops, a few bars, restauarnts, business etc, where the hotel is. Sagreda La Familia is basically just a construction site inside, don't pay to go in, see it for free from the outside.Tip for tour bus users, don't go for the big orange route (as we did), instead go for the red  blue bus routes which are more flexible and you are more likely therefore to use. Both are about 25 Euros for two days, hop on and hop off. We won't rush back to Barcelona, anywhere in Italy is better, but if we do find oursleves there again, Cristal Palace would be a reasonable base. ',POOR,
'excellent location Just returned from 6 nights/5 day stay. Excellent location, close to everything, but on a quiet street in an uspcale district.The rooms are very small and extremely hot-had to sleep with open windows in March and heard many complaints about heat from other guests in the hotel as well. The beds are very firm, however the size of room and the hard beds are not unusual for hotels in Europe. The hotel was very clean, bathroom in our room 605 was modern and spotless, the towels were changed daily. The front door staff was not too friendly, but professional and helpful with tour and show reservations. Complementary use of computers is a benefit, make sure to request to print the boarding passes if you wish to do so, since there is no printer generally, but exceptions are made for boarding passes.We did not eat at the hotel, but the bar was pleasant enough after day of sightseeing.Overall, hotel is functional and clean, but at best 3 star. Would recommend for travelers who plan on sightseeing and spending littel time inside if you can get a good deal. Once again, location is amazing. ',POOR,
'The Cristal was not my kind of Palace September 26-30, 2007This was my second organized tour since my college days some twenty years ago. I was on a tour organized by AHI International and we were to stay at the Cristal Palace for five nights. While our brochure listed the hotel as four star, first-class, I'd say that was a generous description. The hotel was ideally located a mere five minute walk from Las Ramblas and one of Gaudi's buildings was right around the corner. Breakfast and dinner were included in our package and served in the hotel's dining room. The food was fairly good, but by day four it would have been better to explore the local restaurants for dinner on our own. Our hotel room, a double, as I was traveling with my senior citizen mother, was adequate, and looked out to the court yard. My gripe with the room was in the bathroom. The first night I thought I heard water dripping and went to check the bathroom faucet. The dripping water was coming from the ceiling from the room above us!We immediately notified the front desk and they said they would fix the problem. The next day a maintenance person had come into the room and dabbed some fresh paint on the leak. (Ya, that's how I fix leaks at my house. NOT!)No suprise that the water continued to leak through the ceiling every night of our five day stay. Trying to sleep at night was like participating in a water tourture test, a mild test, I'll admit. We could hear the constant drips and eventual streaming of the water breaking through the paint repair.A friend of mine is heading to Barcelona in April and asked about my hotel stay at the Cristal Palace. I told her to look elsewhere. ',POOR,

'Excellent Location!! Originally we'd plan to stay at a different hotel in the Gothic Quarter however after doing a bit of looking around we got a good deal at the Cristal Palace.The location was fantastic right in the L'Eixample area of the city  a two minute walk from the Passeig de Gracia where both the aeroport bus stops along with both the tourist bus companies. It was literally around the corner from the famous Casa Batilo  close to Placa de Catalunya.The only downfall to the location was that the L'Eixample area seemed to be one of the expensive areas for food  it was sometimes difficult to find breakfast (unless you ate at the hotel)The hotel itself was of a very high standard with an impressive lobby  the rooms were very clean  nice. We arrived at midnight  the reception staff were very helpful we were given a twin room  when we explained that we had booked a double they were happy to move us however it would be the following day  the staff were happy to move our luggage when we did move. The odd thing was that there was no kettle in the room but coffee  cups so if you wanted a morning cup of coffee you had to go out into the hallway  use the fancy coffee machine.Overall the hotel was great  you couldn't fault it so If you want a great location with a clean  friendly hotel then i would recommend the Eurostars Cristal Palace. ',GOOD,
'Good location for exploring the city We made a last-minute booking for this hotel and we weren't disappointed. We were given an apartment in the building next door to the main hotel, and it was very clean and spacious, with a nice lounge. It was reasonably priced, compared with others in the city.The hotel is a few minutes walk from the hurly burly of Las Ramblas, and in a slightly quieter location than many others. It's also very near to the bus station at Placa Catalunya. There was no city view - only a panorama of the workmen refurbishing the building opposite - not that we minded. They seemed to read newspapers a lot...As we weren't in the main hotel we chose not to use any of its facilities, and so can't comment on them. The staff seemed very competent and pleasant. Unfortunately, the hotel has the skinflint policy of charging for a safety deposit key (admittedly very small, though). That's just a trivial pet hate.The location was fine for walking to all the usual attractions - such as the Sagrada Familia and the Gothic District. In the L'Eixample district behind the hotel are a few coffee shops and bars which are ideal for breakfasts and snacks.We had a late departure and thought about extending check-out for a few hours. The price was 80 Euros, so we declined.In summary: we had a comfortable stay in a good quality room. We don't know what the main hotel rooms are like, but the apartments were fine. We'd definitely recommend them. ',GOOD,

'This Hotel Sparkles Just returned from a four night stay at the Cristal Palace in Barcelona. We were slightly put out on arrival when we were told that our friends were not booked in although this was soon sorted out. We were given adjacent rooms in the Apartment Block next to the Hotel.Believe me, this is not a minus. The apartment was a two floor enormous room with large lounge area ,sofas TV, Fridge etc.Upstairs on the Gallery landing were two beds plenty of wardrobe space and a very tasteful bathroom.We were absolutely delighted.Hotel restaurant served an excellant breakfast and the hotel is very clean (Bedding changed three times during our four day stay) Staff very helpful and obliging.The location is very good with the Passe De Gracia on minutes away and the Placa Catalnunia a short walk.Very handy for good quality shops and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. ',GOOD,
'Great Location, Nice Staff This is a perfect hotel for a weekend in Barcelona. Really good location and you won't need to use public transport or taxis at all unless you are heading out of the city eg airport or Nou Camp. The rooms are nothing special but are clean and comfortable. The reatuarant and bar in the hotel aren't really up to much but there's lot's about. I've returned here about three times already and have no compliants. The staff are really friendly and make an effort to be nice! ',GOOD,
'great location - to overpriced Boyfriend  I have just returned from a weekend stay at Cristal Palace. We booked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor. The main thing we wanted was location. This was exactly what had been reported on here and was correct. It was excellent for walking about. The hotel we felt was very basic for the price we paid, far too expensive. I had requested a room on a low floor which was taken note of. The room was small, with twin beds pushed together instead of a double. Apart from the bin having the previous guests rubbish in it was very clean. I told the maid about the bin not being emptied and she cleaned it immediately. The staff spoke a little english but were helpful when I asked for directions and about the airport bus. The only main problem was the saturday I could not sleep because of the noise from the road and the traffic outside. Sunday night was quieter. We would reccommend this hotel for location but not for value for money. Thank you for the people who advised on here about the bus touristic which was excellent the best way to get around. My boyfriend was very disappointed because we went to the barcelona football stadium and it was closed for the tour. We went at 4pm on sunday but it closed at 2.30 that day. The cable cars were very good with a wonderful view. Apart from not seeing the stadium we had a lovely time. Also thank you to the person who suggested fresh  ready bakery they sell the best ham and cheese croissants i have ever had. Other advise I give is watch your bags and pockets at all time. We went prepared for pickpockets and avoided a scam because we had read about it. A lovely romantic weekend with lovely memories we will cherish. ',POOR,
'Enjoyable stay at the Cristal Palace 6 of us booked 2 rooms before and after a cruise that left from Barcelona. I made the reservations through the hotel website and experienced no problems. The hotel staff was polite. and courteous. Check-in was efficient and we were quickly escorted to our rooms. The rooms are average in size but comfortably fit 3 of us in each room with the help of a rollaway bed. The rooms were clean and quiet. The breakfast buffet had several selections from dry cereal to eggs. The front desk staff was helpful at directing us to several good area restaurants.The Hotel is centrally located in the city with an easy walk to Las Rambles, Placa de Catalunya, and the Bus Turistic stops. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars in the area. On the day of our departure we had an early Sunday morning flight. We requested 2 taxis for the six of us at 5:30 in the morning. They were waiting for us when we checked out. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Hotel in a great location We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights celebrating our 10 yr anniversay. The hotel was in an excellent location and was close to many of the main attractions. The bus stop and metro station are minutes away and its very easy to find.The hotel staff were very friendly and we was given a warm welcome, our room was very large with a lovely bathroom and jacuzi bath and was very quiet. Breakfast was a buffet and was very nice with a large variety of food that would suite any taste- again the staff were very friendly and the service brilliant as they were constantly refilling things when they were getting empty, it was very good that it was until 10.30am.It was very handy to have computers that were free to use to guests staying in the hotel.I would highly recommed this hotel to anyone who is going to Barcelona and it made our stay a very memorable one.

'Four Star???? I really would not recommend this hotel. It has a good location only a short stroll from main attractions.However, the rooms are tiny with very poor amenities.

'Great 50th weekend! We stayed in Barcelona for 4 nights in January 2007 and would highly recommend the Crystal Palace. The staff were very helpful, the hotel was clean and well cared for, recently refurbished, and the rooms were ample in size and a great location for the underground system, tourist bus and La Ramblas.Some minor niggles about the hotel were that the room was so warm that you needed the window open all night, which was OK as there wasn't any significant street noise. If you like hot food for breakfast then there wasn't a great choice - frankfurter sausage, fatty bacon, sloppy scrambled eggs and half tomatoes with a bit of cheese on, however there were ample cereals; cakes; fruit; croissants; yoghurts etc. which more then made up for the poor hot food choices. Don't expect a great view if you have a room at the back of the hotel as 1st-8th floors look onto the back of a building. Poor amount of hanging space if you are going for longer than a few nights - just one small single wardrobe providing coat hangers that unclip from the rail, and x3 small drawers. Take a kettle if you like a cuppa first thing in the morning too as this hotel doesn't provide one.None of the above spoilt our holiday, as I said these were just minor niggles, overall this is a great hotel in a superb location - between the Pg de Gracia and Rbla de Catalunya, only about 5 mins walk to the Placa Catalunya where the tourist bus, ticket office is and where you can pick up both the blue and red line buses, also the top of La Rambla. There are 2 metro stations close to the hotel's street on Pg de Gracia + a tourist bus stop for the red line (which you need to visit the Segrada Familia)We had a wonderful time in Barcelona and found their transport system so refreshingly organised and easy to use. Looking forward to our next visit! ',GOOD,
'Extremely Pleased Lovely hotel, friendly staff. Have computer area at your disposable with internet free of charge. Rooms were spotless. Restaurant a bit pricey but it's so close to many restaurants and bars. Would definately recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Not so special, where were the crystals? In winter, our rather small hotel room (apparently 4 stars?!) was VERY hot all the time. No airconditioning added to the frustration. Staff were alright, but advised us the market was shut on Sunday when in fact one or two local ones were open (we discovered ourselves). I don't understand how they rated this 4 stars. Overall I cannot complain though - maybe I am just comparing it to 4 star hotels I have been to that are much more glamorous. ',POOR,
'Fantastic Location! We went for a short break to Barca and had a lovely time at the Cristal Palace Hotel. I can't really fault much about the hotel. The rooms were spacious, beds comfy, lovely clean bathroom. Our maid was amazing and left the room absolutely spotless and pristine. The receptionists were very helpful too. My only slight complaints were that the lobby bar was quite expensive (for two poor students anyway) and the coffee machine on our floor was broken. But these are trivial complaints and it would be expected for a hotel of this standard to charge higher than average prices for drinks. The location is perfect, 5 mins walk to Las Ramblas, lots of lovely restaurants, bars and shops! ',GOOD,
'Very nice! The best of all is really the location, only 2 blocks away from Catalunia Square through Passeo de Gracia. I've payed a special price of 84 Euros/night for a double room without breakfast for a 2 nights stay in November 2006. The relation price/quality is good. The room is nicely decorated in light blue, with enough space to walk arround. The bathroom is big and very clean, such as the rest of the room, which has no carpet, good for who is alergic to dust. The staff is very kind. Also, you have at your disposal a computer in the lobby with free internet access, that became very handy for me to book may last night of stay in Bcn, because this hotel was already fully booked for this last night.

'Great Value and Location           ',GOOD,
'Fantastic value and great location Stayed at this hotel on 2nd November and have to say it was great value and a in an ideal location being only one block away from the Las Ramblas so just a few minites walk away.We only stayed one night but would like to have stayed longer in in this fantastic city.I upgraded to the Romantic room and it was a mere 125 Euros including a bottle of Cava in the price.Next time i may stay in one of the suites which are accross the road but have seperate bedrooms and loads of space and just 150 euros a night.We walked quite a way down to the marina and ate in a fantastic restaurant part of the Monchos group! check out this link apparently the one with the buffet is the best which was recommended to me by somebody who lived there for 4 years :----.Also we had a lucky night in the Casino which is located in the ARTS Hotel on the marina and people can get in with jeans etc which is strange but handy to know.Enjoy Barca but be carefull of the pick pockets and also the ladies with babies who approach you as they are all in on a scam that may leave you with less items that you went out with. ',GOOD,
'central but only a 3 star This hotel is in a fab location in las ramblas it is spotlessly clean the view from our room was of the back of derilect buildings, but it is a city hotel , the breakfast was ok, but i think its only worthy of a 3 star rating. ',POOR,
'superb hotel This was our 4th visit to the city but first time at this hotel as we have stayed before at the Avenida Palace just around the corner. We are glad the (more expensive) Avenida was full as we chose this alternative purely on location and reviews and we were not disappointed. We will certainly stay here on any future visits to this wonderful city as we found our courtyard facing room quiet, spotless and with plenty enough space for a city hotel room. The bathroom was very spacious and well appointed. Staff were helpful and the breakfast (included in deal) was super with everything you could wish for. We have since recommended this hotel to several friends and clients. ',GOOD,
'More than we expected Having never traveled in Europe, we worried about finding a good hotel. How lucky we were to have found this one!We spent three nights pre-cruise here. Eleven of us traveled together, splitting between two hotels. The four that stayed in a more expensive (higher rated) hotel, were very disappointed. The seven who stayed in this hotel loved it. The rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. The beds are very firm, but we slept great. The hotel is located in a GREAT area - a quiet street in the middle of everything. The staff was friendly and helpful.A few things to note about this hotel:1. As with most hotels in Europe, you must put your key in a slot inside your room to run all the electrical. 2. Also as with most European hotels, there are no washcloths.3. The shower over tub configuration in the bathrooms is fine, but there is nothing to keep the water contained, causing the floor to get wet and slippery. 4. Air conditioning in much of Europe isn't as robust as one might experience in the US. We had very hot weather during our stay, but the A/C in this hotel was pretty good.No complaints at all - we will definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Can't go wrong with this hotel. The Cristal Palace is a clean, spacious hotel with individual controlled air-con in the rooms and a super location. Handy for everything. If you don't get breakfast included go out of the door of the hotel and turn right and right again at the corner. There are a few places on the next block up (towards Diagonal) which do lovely breakfast cakes (St Jaume) is a specialist cake bakery and has some cracking things on offer. For the Brits (like me) who like a cuppa in your room... take a travel kettle and t-bags! This is common in many european hotels... they just don't get the idea of tea when i fancy it. A very minor issue in an otherwise really nice hotel. You'll enjoy it. I found the staff all helpful... (some of the American comments suggest that they may be grumpy... not so but they won't kiss your bum either, you are in Barcelona, sort stuff out for yourself!)Pete and Family. Wirral. UK ',GOOD,
'Great location, value, especially for family Stayed here for 3 nights in July with my wife, 13 yo son, and 10 yo daughter. We booked a family room, which was outstanding. Very spacious. Second floor had two twin beds pushed together in a large bedroom, TV, a large bathroom with full bath/shower, and sink. The first floor had a bathroom with a shower and sink (no full size bath), a small alcove with a twin bed, and a large living room with a TV, small desk, two couches, and windows opening to the interior of the city block. We had no noise problems whatsoever, although I suspect that's because we were on the interior of the block. The kids really enjoyed having some privacy and their own beds. The location is great, it's 1/2 block from Passeig de Gracia, two blocks north of the north-end of Las Ramblas, two blocks north of Plaza de Catalunya, and one block from a Bus Turistic stop (hop-on/hop-off).We ate breakfast at the cafe across the street. The owner spoke a little bit of English, but my rusty Spanish definitely was useful when ordering. There is a computer downstairs in the lobby with internet access, but since it is popular, expect a short wait and don't expect to be able to spend long on it given others waiting.Several minor complaints about the room...1) Other than the bathrooms, everything is very open, so everyone can hear everything despite the large size2) The TV controllers for the 2 TV's would sometimes affect both TV's. So someone watching TV downstairs, for example, could end up changing the channel or such on the one upstairs. One night, one of our neighbors ending up turning on our TV during the middle of the night while we were asleep.3) The kitchen is locked and they will not allow you access to it.The family room location is literally next door to the main location. It's probably about 30 feet from the lobby entrace to the adjacent entrance. You need a key to get into the adjacent property, and they only have enough keys for one per family, although the front desk is happy to come let you in if the group gets split up.I definitely recommend the hotel for its location and value, especially for families. We would stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Great for families with teenagers This was a perfect hotel for a family with two teenagers - we can't stay anywhere with just one room and two double beds anymore. We stayed in a junior suite, which had two rooms - one room with two good sized beds, and a living room with two smaller beds. We picked the hotel on a recommendation from another family with teenagers.The suite was lovely - clean, comfortable, nicely furnished. Couldn't fault it in any way. We didn't have any problem with noise, either. The bathroom was really nice, with a powerful shower!The location is excellent - close enough to La Ramblas (which we found a bit tacky to be honest), and round the corner from a red and blue 'bus touristic' stop - handy if you plan to tour the city this way. The location meant we were able to have a siesta back in the hotel every afternoon, when the heat got too much for us. Also round the corner from an airport bus stop. ',GOOD,
'Great stay, would go back again. We stayed in the Cristal Palace for 4 nights. I must admit that there was some noise problem as I could clearly hear people from the next door showering, coughing and spitting. But it only lasted for a while in one night. The rest of the nights were ok so we were fine.The hotel room was huge in European standard, as well as the bathroom. It was clean and modern. It had turn down service at night, which was nice. The staff spoke English well and was generally helpful and friendly. We did have some problem with the TV but they sent someone up to fix it the same day. Location was perfect, just off Las Ramblas.Overall experience was great, with this price for a 3-4 star hotel in Barcelona we would definitely recommend it. ',GOOD,
'Less than expected We had reserved a 4 bedded room. Actually they put us in an apartment house adjacent to the hotel where renovations were taking place from early morning throughout the day. The accomodations were adequate but less than advertised. ',POOR,
'Noisy but great location The location is ideal, just a few blocks from Las Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter, and lots of shopping. The neighborhood felt safe and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The accomodations were fine and the room was clean. However, we heard lots of noise in our room every night until about 2 or 3am. The sounds appeared to come from the neighboring building and not from within the hotel. All the noise really put a damper on our stay. Other than that it was a satisfactory stay. On a side note, the hotel offers parking for 16 euros a day. ',POOR,
'Great Location As all mention, you cannot find a better location for exploring the city and I would definately recommend the hotel. However...... the walls of the rooms are PAPER thin and you can hear everything in the room next door. It really is very disturbing! So, if are are a light sleeper OR plan on making a lot of noise... Look elsewhere! ',POOR,
'Solid hotel with central location The best thing about this hotel is its location, as mentioned by numerous previous posts. It is just outside the main tourist areas of Las Ramblas and the Barri Gotic. It is only 2 blocks from the nearest subway station (Passeig de Gracia) and is next door to the Rambla de Catalunya, which has numerous restaurants, cafes, etc. The room we booked, a double, was pretty basic. I would place it as an average size in relation to a New York City hotel, though the bathroom was pretty large. The bathtub also doubled as a jacuzzi. No baclonies are available at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly, and while some has excellent language skills (Spanish, French and English) others were a little more spotty. ',GOOD,

'Easter Break Have just stayed at the Cristal Palace Hotel over the Easter Holidays. The Hotel is situated near to Plata de Catalunya Sqaure at the top of the Ramblas. The bus from the airport stops in the square and it is only a five minute walk from there to the hotel. There are plenty of bars, resturants around the square so no need to travel far to eat and drink, and there are 3-4 metro stations around the Hotel. The Hotel itself is in a quite street away from the hussle and bussle. It has large spacious bedrooms and bathroom - and we had three beds in the room but it still didn't feel cramped. The shower was wonderful - very hot and powerful good to wake you up to get back out around the city. Barcelona itself is a fabulous city with so much to do and look at - already looking forward to travelling there again. The tourist bus is great, you can hop on and off all day at all the major sightseeing points - good way to find your bearings. ',GOOD,
'Super Hotel We stayed at the Cristal Palace from Dec 25-28 and were very pleased.The room was very high grade. We found it quite clean and with good quality furnishings. The roll-way for our teenage daughter was in place and set-up on our arrival. Front desk is very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast in the restaurant is good and a fair price. Location is excellent: one block off of the Gran Via and Passeig de Gracia. We walked over to Placa de Catalunya with ease (5 minutes) and strolled the Gran Via in the evening. Casa Battlo is an easy walk as well. ',GOOD,
'Highly recommend the Cristal Palace       Marble Master Bath ',GOOD,
'Great Location We stayed 4 days in advance of our cruise, and one day at the end. After reading the reviews before we left I decided to book this hotel. The rates seemed reasonable, although varied during the time of our stay, (btwn E147 - E179, and the location can't be beat. It is on Deputacion, one block from Passaige de Gracia, and one block from Placa Catalunya. Anna at the front desk took very good care of us, but I can't say the rest of the staff was over eager to make one feel welcome. Only one night of our reservtions came with breakfast, but I wouldn't pay for it if I had to. There are plenty of cafes around the area.Our room overlooked the back and was very clean and quiet, although not overbearingly large. The room came with robes (nice touch) and a whirlpool bath. Ask for a room in the back. Our vacation did not start well at the airport upon arrival. We landed in terminal A and our luggage was at terminal B, but no one told us..along with other Americans on the flight.When we asked staff at the airport to point us in the direction of the baggage claim, they did not speak English, nor were they interested in helping. The cab drivers on the all in all do not speak English, and a cab should only cost you around E20-25 to the heart of the city. It cost us E24. Please be aware, that there is a different rate on the weekends (higher), and that they charge you $2 for every bag placed in the trunk. In fact we think the cab driver taking us to the airport on Sunday really took us for a ride even though the traffic was nearly nil, the meter read E3.75 before we drove away from the curb, and the ride back cost us E31.75 with one less bag in the trunk. I think the hotel location was great, but if it is any indication of a European hotel, it was probably pretty good. ',POOR,
'Excellent Hotel, Room, Location, Food We stayed at this Hotel in Sepember 2005 for 4 nights, the hotel is in and excellent location just 5 minutes from the square and Rambles away from all the noise yet within striking distance all many superb rrestaurants and bars. The Hotel was very good, rooms air conditioned and well equiped. breakfast was very comprehensive with everything you could ask for. Do try the side streets as they are more spanish and less commercial than Ramblas. Take care in the Port Olympic restaurants as some are a rip off, especially EL Cangrejo Loco, poor food and service. Take the Turistic open buses, 2 day pass and 3 buses will ensure you see all the main area's of Barcelona. A must visit is Gaudi's house. ',GOOD,
'Barcelona in August It's been said before, but allow me to reiterate . . . the Hotel Cristal Palace's location is absolutely perfect. We got everywhere really quickly; rarely had to take a taxi. (Only twice, returning from Port Vell/Barceoloneta). We walked right out of the hotel, down two blocks to Placa Catalunya, onto the Ramblas and right down to the Port. The hotel is one block above Gran Via (a primary east-west route, connecting Placa Espanya and Placa Catalunya, and along which the aerobus from the airport runs), and thus, two blocks north of Placa Catalunya. You can catch a bus on Gran Via that runs all the way up Montjuic to the Fundacio Juan Miro. The hotel is Located between Rambla Catalunya (the CALM Rambla) and Passieg de Gracia (main N/S boulevard with Gucci, Chanel, Zara, and spectacular modernisme buildings, including Casa Battlo.) We were no more than two minutes walk to either Placa Catalunya station or Passeig de Gracia station, so that we could connect directly to the four major metro trains in BCN. Also, Passeig de Gracia has a commuter rail station, at which you can the line that goes south to Sitges, for a day trip to a gorgeous beach town. You are also a stone's throw from the BCN tourist center.When we'd go to the old city, and had become pleasantly overwhelmed by the cacaphony, stepping out into L'Eixample was like breathing clean air. And arriving at the Cristal Palace (whose name I could not say without a giggle) and stepping through the strange semi-circular automatic doors, was yet another level of peace. The hotel itself is quite comfortable -- if you, like me, have read all the other reviews, you'll read that there is a tad bit of noise that commingles from room to room, and that the rooms are small, but it's nothing a city dweller isn't used to. The room we stayed in was well planned, with a low and small scale decor and huge, double glazed windows that made it seem much larger. As for street noise, the new windows completely eliminate it. Expect cool polished marble floors throughout, huge bath with double sink, big tub, gentle A/C, freshly ironed linens daily, careful and considerate room service and housekeeping. (If you sleep past noon, your room will still be cleaned.) Most of the guests we met were mature folks (of all ages) and the hotel is set up to handle people keeping all hours. The desk staff speak many languages, and are helpful. I was concerned about privacy in such a small space, and yet I never felt intruded upon. Ice machines would be a nice touch, but you can ask at the desk for a bowl. The hotel has some free newspapers (including the Herald Tribune in English, with an El Pais English insert) located back by the breakfast area. I never did figure out the espresso machine centrally located on our floor across from the lift. Frankly, I don't think it adds to the charm of the hotel. In Barcelona, if you drink coffee, cafe con leche is one of the most sublime pleasures. Why would we give that up for a powdered creamer and coffee from a foil-wrapped tablet?By all means, try the chicken and avocado sandwich via the 24-hour room service. The mini-bar is reasonable! The Pictory resturant on premises is expensive and elegant, and we didn't try it, but one day when we wandered in in search of the chicken sandwich, the waitress was gracious and helpful as she settled us in the bar area and presented us with a room service menu. And THEN we ordered a pitcher of sangria made by the barman in the most skillful way: it was amazing, with spices, anise, fresh fruit, cold: a perfect beverage for a steamy summer BCN afternoon. We didn't do the breakfast -- there's a cafe immediately across the street and another one to the right, as you walk out, where they have fresh-squeezed oj (zumo) and if you ask nicely, they'll make you a cheese omelette. Also, on Passeig de Gracia, on the corner, the Vaca Paca has a 10 euro buffet libre dinner. As we were on a tight budget (spending $1000 each for 12 nights in BCN) we took advantage of it once or twice and it's well worth it. My sister and I spent 12 nights, cheek by jowl in BCN on a limited budget, and felt pampered and protected at the Hotel Cristal Palace. We would surely stay there again, if we have the opportunity.

'loved it, a clean friendly helpfull hote We arrived by taxi from BCA airport (30 euros). I was on holiday with my husband and our two sons. We checked in and were taken to the junior suite in a building next door. The suite was amazing, spacious with two single beds downstairs, 1 shower rooms with a toilet and 1 double bed up a spiral staircase, with a large area for storage and a large bathroom. The suite was very clean with its own adjustable AC and daily maid service. The hotel staff were very helpfull with advise and could all speak english. This hotel is located in the perfect location for shops, cafe's, bars and a 5 minute walk to catalonia square. Ladies look out for deals from the handbag shop opposite the hotel she cuts her prices in the summer by 75%. The metro was just around the corner and it took you every were. ',GOOD,

'Enjoyed Cristal Palace Enjoyed recent 3 night trip to this hotel.The room was fine. We had a large private balcony area with a table and chairs which would have been great in summer. You had to be careful closing the sliding window at night otherwise there was a wind noise. We were at the back of the hotel and it was quiet.The breakfast buffet was fine although for those accustomed to a bit of leniency on the closing time or a warning of things disappearing at closing time you wont get that here! Most of the staff were excellent. Enquiries about a restaurant were met with assistance with the reservation, and it was good too. We did encounter a sarcastic, lazy barman. He tried hard not to serve us at all. On return one night he told us the bar was closed despite there being a sign showing it was open for another half hour. He then chatted to the reception staff before condescending to take our money. The other staff deserve a more enthusiastic colleagueThis was good value on my 6th trip to the city staying in a different hotel of similar standard each time. I would stay here again if I am lucky enough to return to this fantastic city.Excellent location walked a lot of places near enough to metro for further travel. ',GOOD,
'Watch your wallet  This hotel is in a good location  very quiet. The only problem we had was the maid stealing my mobile phone  money from my wallet. The attitude of the staff when we reported that my stuff has been taken was not very good they thought we were just making it up.This is not a 4 star hotel more like 2 or 3. You will find a better hotel for the same price per night in Barcelona. ',POOR,
'Review of suites The suites were great for a family of 4 with young children (7 and 5). They are in a separate building next to the main building and have their own locked door for security. The suite was two levels with two bathrooms. Upstairs was a loft with a king size bed (two twins pushed together), TV, and bathroom with shower. Downstairs was a sitting area with one twin bed under the stairs. A second twin bed was in an alcove off the hallway from the front door, effectively making it a separate bedroom with its own small bathroom and shower. We all, therefore, had our own rooms which was brilliant.It was clean, in a very central location for all the tourist activities, and had a very good breakfast buffett. We had a rate of 150 euros per night during February. ',GOOD,
'average hotel, but not four star I booked a long weekend at this hotel for my husband's 40th birthday. When we arrived we were given a tiny room which overlooked a brick wall and had twin beds. I had booked a double and requested a view. After much argument with the surly reception staff we were given a much better room- it was bigger, had a double bed and a nice little balcony with a table and chairs. The view was not great but we decided it was a vast improvement! The position of this hotel is excellent -it's very central and we walked everywhere. Las Ramblas was within 5 minutres of the hotel. Breakfast was adequate. All in all a decent hotel, but more a 3 star than a 4. ',POOR,
'Cristal Palace So Central and quiet Travelling from New Zealand and not knowing Hotels in Barcelona we used Trip Advisor Reviews to select the Cristal Palace. The room was excellent, quiet and clean, the staff exceedingly helpful, food in the restaurant excellent and position of Hotel very central as we walked everywhere. Would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Great location, good clean hotel Just got back from 4 nights at the Hotel Cristal Palace. Location was excellent, good area near the Placa Catalunya and a lot of the sights not to mention the upmarket shops round the corner. Stayed in Duplex apartment style rooms next to hotel ideal for a family of four. Could probably get a couple of rooms for the same price but we wanted space to relax. Apartments were clean but a bit noisy at night (neighbouring apartments rather than street noise) and upstairs bathroom was a bit smelly but clean. Felt secure. Breakfast average but Good service. ',GOOD,
'perfect for the price If you're travelling and planning on staying in yer room the whole time...then this place isn't for u. But if you're lookin for a fair price for a clean, centrally located, classy, boutique-y hotel...this is the place. Great complimentary breakfast, friendly staff...if yer on a budget and wanna live a little like a Calalan...eat tapas, check out the amazing Gaudi archetecture...and have comfy place to go back to after too many Estrellas...check it out.

'GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!!! Switched hotels 2 days before we left on our vacation. Very glad I did. We stayed 1 day(June 29) before our 12 day cruise and then again 1 day (July 13) after our cruise. Staff was extremely helpful. No language problem at all. We stayed in there suite. Which was like staying in a loft apartment (without the kitchen). Very very clean hotel. I noticed how the cleaning help dusted everything. The room was a little pricy 275, euros, but considering the size was worth it. Only problem was the first night the air-conditioner went out. Staff was willing to change our room or give us a 20% discount. Can't tell you about the food though, we did not eat at the hotel. Would stay here again . ',GOOD,
'Hotel with the world's smallest rooms - ever! I booked this hotel online, looking forward to the 4-star experience. Like the other reviewer, our room was extremely disappointing; tiny and looked out onto 3 concrete walls which meant it was permanently dark. At night, the noise from other guests was annoying. We stayed in March and while the weather outside was pleasant, the heat in the room was unbearable. This hotel is not by any means a 4-star hotel. I would not stay here again and would recommend anyone that there are better hotels in Barcelona that are cheaper and closer to the centre of things.  ',POOR,
'Great Location, great hotel Stayed here in March 2004. We got one of the duplex rooms located next to the main hotel. The duplex was HUGE and great for 2 kids and 2 adults. The location could not be better - you can walk to all major sites. Staff was courteous and professional. Breakfast was very good during the week and even better (more selections) on the weekends. Would definitely recommend this hotel.  ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel! We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, May7-9 for 144 euros/night. Our room was on the 9th floor and is small but we had a nice balcony overlooking some courtyards. The room was extremely quiet and tranquil, and we did not hear any of our neighbors. The hotel is close to many attractions and allowed us to either walk or use the subway. The weather was cool but we did noticed that the air conditioner was functioning. There is a convenient taxi stand across the street from the hotel, which we used to get to the pier. Our plane to Europe was late and we had to run to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona. We made the flight but our luggage didn't. The hotel called Air France 3 times to check on our luggage, which eventually came on the second day (Thank goodness since we were to leave for a cruise on the 9th!). We also had our ATM card stolen and the front desk called our bank so that we could cancel the card. Beware of the ATM-jamming scam where they jam the ATMs and then steal your card! The front desk staff was exceptional and we will definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Not bad not fantastic We stayed at the Hotel Cristal palace for 3 nights last week after much hotel surfing. I chose Cristal because there was the option of having a junior suite /duplex (拢120 per night no breakfast) which seemed reasonable. The suite itself was a very decent size with a large living room facing a quiet inner courtyard (better than traffic at front). However there were no tea and coffee making facilities as stated although the receptionist said a waiter would bring us some if required. It was easier to get a cappucino to go from the Taormina bar opposite(good for bottle water, snacks too). The bathroom was clean and modern and had everyting you could wish for but the bedroom was quite tiny. All in all it was a value for money if a little souless hotel. (The suites were in a separate building and away from normal hotel facilities) 5 mins from Placa Catalunya and the Modernist buildings on the Eixample. My best tip for Barcelona? the Tourist Bus which has a Northern and Southern route for same price (20Euros for 2 days) you need hardly use the metro and the buses run every few minutes from P.Catalunya. Take note - everywhere is closed on Mondays except from Nou Camp! ',POOR,

'Highly recommended We stayed at the Bryant Park for several days just prior to Christmas. Our room was spacious and had pretty good views, although we had not specifically requested a view, which made our stay that little more enjoyable. The room was of a good size for NY and was very comfortable, and the bathroom was of a high standard. Staff were friendly but professional and discreet, and the Cellar Bar is a cool place to enjoy a drink. Our one word of advice would be to consider pre-booking a transfer (e.g. limo/taxi) if heading out of town, as the Bryant Park is in a crosstown location and getting a cab from right outside can be a drama during rush hour (is it worth including this in the in-room hotel guide?). Overall, a great stay and we can't wait to return! ',GOOD,
'Bryant: the Best in service Was happily surprised about the friendliness of the staff (after all, this IS New York).I ordered room service and a glass of wine with the order. The gentleman who delivered this and I do apologize since I didn't catch his name was extremely friendly and interested in my conversation. I realized after he left that my wine was not with the order. He immediately returned, apologetic and provided a bottle of wine from the in-house dining people. He didn't blame the omission on anyone and really made the mistake a win for me by his nice attitude. I loved the ambiance, the view of Bryant Park with ice skating rink front and center and will happily book with them again. Fran Waite ',GOOD,
'Really expensive Hip Hotel We had a good 3 nights stay in The Bryant Park Hotel.However i can not understand the raving comments about this hotel.Pros:Good quality room, we had a Junior Suite with two double beds, they were really huge, also room really spacey, bathroom well equipped, nice big tub.Location is very good, one minute away from 5th avenue, but other hotels like Sofitel, Marriott Residence inn have an equal location.Cons:Not a single bottle of water provided in the room as a gratuity. We payed 625 Dollars for our room to find our that a small Evian would cost 12 bucks?! Thats really annoying.If you forget toothpaste: you have to buy it from them for a fortune! No breakfast incl in the priceThe view of Bryant Park is only available from a few rooms, ours was promised to have a view but then you really have to stick your head out to see the Park.Reception and Concierge staff were quite helpful but did not go the extra mile and i think they were acting quite a bit too cool for a hotel of that category.Dont expect a five star service. The hotel is for people that are mostly into fashion and hip and cool stuff. ',GOOD,
'Good Hotel. Nice Room. Nothing Exceptional. A Safe Bet! Came in from NJ for a romantic weekend with my wife the day after Thanksgiving. Black Friday in NYC is not for the weak! The city was jammed packed as were the stores, but the hotel was VERY quiet. We checked in on Friday after making a last minute reservation on Weds. We were able to upgrade to the Bryant Park Suite which was very large for any hotel room, especially for a NY hotel. Christian the reservations manager was great to work with and helped us out tremendously. The room had a sitting room, and 1.5 baths. Nice glassed in shower and very large tub in marble bathroom. Bed was not huge nor the most comfortable to sleep on but it was ok. Room was very stark with a white color theme. In fact I don't think there were any photos hung on the walls! Our room overlooked Byant Park which was quite nice especially with the ice skating rink below. The location of this hotel cannot be beat as its sits right in the midle of the city at 6th and 40th street. I actually expected something more exciting, cool, different, etc. but this was just a nice hotel. Very good but not headturning! Nothing you'd write home about which is the only negative thing I'd say. We'd probably stay somewhere else next time for something different but this is a safe bet! ',GOOD,
'Location, Location, Location Stayed here for a week in a Deluxe Queen room. We got quite a good deal directly from the hotel. After a gruelling 18 hour flight from Hong Kong we called the hotel to ask if we could check in early (it was 7am) and luckily they agreed which we were very impressed with. The normal check-in time is 3pm which quite frankly I think is ridiculous!The room itself was a decent size but very dark as the window was small and we had a side-view of the park. However, the bed was REALLY comfy with a flat screen TV which unlike most hotels was at the right height and the right size for the room. The bathroom was large with Molton Brown amenities and a well pressurised shower. As some previous reviewers have mentioned this hotel is only for fans of minimalism. The best thing about the hotel would definitely be the location which is in mid-town which is convenient to get everywhere in Manhattan.The only slight negative is that some of the hotel staff forgot to smile in an effort to look cool. I guess that's the price of cool. Despite that, I would definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'My favorite hotel in New York I am a frequent traveler and a sucker for good hotels. For the last six years I have visited New York once a year and stayed at many different hotels. This year I found my hotel. The Bryant Park has everything one can wish for. Beautiful architecture, excellent beds and the linen floats around you. The room has a big beautiful bathroom, with large and thick towels. The Hotel has an excellent location, only a few minutes walk to the theater district, half an hour stroll to SoHo and Central Park. The Bryant Park is just opposite the hotel, with a beautiful garden and in the winter you can go ice skating. The staff was superior and knew exactly how to take the best care of their gests.All of you looking for a good hotel, treat yourselves well and stay at The Bryant Park, you won鈥檛 be disappointed. I had to prolong my stay because my husband got sick. The stay that could have been very difficult became easier for the sake of the friendly staff at The Bryant Park. We were upgraded to a suite and I felt like a Queen, with a beautiful view over all Manhattan. The hotel staff became our family and did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible, under our circumstances.I don鈥檛 have to look any more for a hotel in New York. I will stay at The Bryant Park hotel next time I visit. Matthildur, Iceland ',GOOD,
'A Great Room Overlooking Bryant Park We travel to New York several times each year, and haveenjoyed stays at a variety of great hotels in the city. Ourvery recent stay at the Bryant Park Hotel, though, was easilyone of our very best.We were given a great room - a 'junior suite', overlooking the Park - an upgrade, though we'd reserved at a bargainrate. The room was very spacious and comfortable, withup the minute furnishings. The bath, with large, separateshower and tub!, was also large, commodious, and well-designed, something very unusual in New York.Wonderful, helpful, cheerful staff. And, of course, what aterrific location, on Bryant Park. ',GOOD,
'Perfect There are few things in New York that make me as happy as a park view room in the Bryant Park Hotel. In the supper the green trees and grass provide a calm dychotomy to the busy city, and in the winter the ice skaters seem so peaceful. The rooms are fantastically modern and minimalistic. The service is fantastic, anything you need is just a phone call away. If you stay multiple times the hotel staff even remembers your name when you arrive. I love this hotel. (the breakfast in bed packages are a great way to get room service, a late check out, and a great room, all in one) ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel in Central Manhattan This was my second stay at the Bryant Park Hotel, and it was every bit as good as the first. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The room service is discreet and unobtrusive. The location of the hotel is excellent -- it's midtown, very good for seeing the sights and getting to locations all over the city. I was travelling alone and needed a nice, quiet room in the city. My room didn't have a view, but it was a good place to be in all other respects.I recommend this hotel unreservedly. ',GOOD,
'Best Boutique in NYC My 4-year old and I have stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel twice recently (and I've stayed there alone on business) and I am in complete agreement with his review, Dad, can we stay here every time we come to NY? I've been to several dozen hotels in NYC in recent years from the highest end to the best budget. Bryant Park has a great location, rooms that are a perfect blend of elegant design and real comfort and attentive but not intrusive staff. The rooms over the park offer a peaceful view of a quintessential midtown city landscape.The staff is exceedingly friendly and efficient. On both recent visits we have received a complimentary upgrade without requesting it. The bathrooms are large and as well-furnished as the best hotels. And the beds are so comfortable that sometimes I wish we weren't in New York with so many things to do just outside the front door. ',GOOD,
'Best in Manhattan I work in the travel industry and have stayed at many different hotels in the New York area. Most offer small rooms, noisy environments and long walks to most of the main sites.The Bryant Park Hotel had none of that. The staff was unbelievably pleasant and accommodating. The rooms were large, comfortable and spacious. Most of all, it is centrally located; with beautiful views of the park.I would definitely return to this hotel and look forward to recommending it to everyone I know. It truly is a gem of a hotel and rates 5 stars in my book. ',GOOD,
'Loved The Bryant Park Hotel I am lucky enough to have travelled all over the world on business enjoying the best in service from the most exotic locales. I was thrilled to find this gem of a hotel right in my backyard of Manhattan, centrally located in midtown. I stayed there for a celebratory weekend with my boyfriend and the service was impeccable from the moment I arrived. The staff is ready and willing to help you with any need or concern. The room 鈥?a junior suite 鈥?was huge by Manhattan's standards and had great views. Plus Koi, an amazing Japanese restaurant, is right downstairs. (Get the Crispy Rice!!!) I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. ',GOOD,
'Excellent weekend in NYC       Bryant Park Hotel from across the park ',GOOD,
'great service I ,like many others, really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It was my first time in NY and i was travel with my twin children aged 11. As i was quite nervous about gettng out and about the staff were extremey helpful whenever I asked questions. The icing on the cake as far as the staff were concerned was that my daughter collapsed with de-hydrated one morning in our room. I called receiption and within a few mintues a doctor was on the telephone suggesting she should be taken to hospital.I panicked but didn't need to worry. within five minutes two membersof staff knocked on the door telling me an ambelance was on its way and did i need help. Everyone was so efficent!!. We finally returned some hours later to be greeted by a lot of the staff all checkng we were ok. When we got to our room there was a ballon say get Well plus a big teddy bear in a box! and a card sgned by the staff.The checked every few hours to see if we needed anything and there after always made sure we had plenty of water in the room. The front staff checked everyday to make sure my daughter was ok. I don't know of any hotel that would give this kind of service!!!!!!! I would like also to mention the door staff wjo were excellent. I would like to thank Darren Sumner who oversaw everythngThe other big bonus is in the park opposite the hotel, every Friday in the summer they have free concerts. The week we were there it was Usher!! ',GOOD,
'A Brilliant Hotel Let me start by saying this hotel is one of the best customer focused establishments I have ever stayed in and I have been fortunate to stay in many 4  5 star hotels. Not only do they have an excellent approach to new guests but they raise the bar even further to repeat customers.My friends and I stay in this hotel when we make our annual trips to NYC from Ireland. On our first visit, we stayed in a 2 Queen Bed Junior Suite with terrace and had such a wonderful time that we booked the same hotel for our visit this October. The restaurant Koi serves the most delicious Japanese food and the bar/hotel is young and trendy which was perfect for 3 young girls!This year we wanted the same room however it was nearly twice the price as what we paid in the previous year. I contacted the hotel directly on the chance they could reduce the rate slightly and even if they just provide us with a room without a terrace as this would be more cost effective. Within a few hours I heard back from Chris Jevas, the reservations director. Not only did he reduce the rate but he matched it to what we had paid last year and included the terrace.A few days before we arrived, Chris emailed to apologise as the terrace was unavailable due to restorations and he reduced our rate by a further $130 per night. When we arrived in our hotel, we got the usual warm greeting and the concierge had all of my restaurants, clubs and limo transportation booked. One of the other conierge even remembered me from last year and was able to recall certain stories and requests!My friend and I went up to our room to unpack where room service brought up a lovely bottle of wine as compliments from Chris. We were so taken aback by all of this as we have never expected such appreciation to repeat guests.I am now making a repeat visit to NYC tomorrow and I contacted the hotel again. Surprise, surprise I was given a deluxe room with a view (I only asked for a standard room) with a $200 reduced rate. Not only this, but they said I could cancel any time without incurring a penalty.This hotel is just wonderful and it is the staff (concierge, front desk, room service, door men, cleaning staff and of course Chris!) that make it so. I will say it might not be to every taste as it is trendy and there is no real lobby. In addition, the only restaurant is open for the evening and serves Japanese which might not appeal to everyone. But this hotel is simply wonderful and if you want excellent service, beautiful large rooms, a young and funky atmosphere, a great dinner, excellent location and an extremely comfortable bed then look no further. ',GOOD,
'Home Away from Home-with Luxurious Service! From Chris in sales to Patrick at the door, the service of this hotel is the best of any in New York. I have stayed at many NYC hotels, from the Peninsula to the Regency and others, and nowhere do you get the personal attention you get at the Bryant Park Hotel. Always smiling and cheerful, and quick to respond to your every need, the personnel at the hotel are faultless. And the rooms! beautiful, immaculate, good sized, with amazing beds and power showers you never want to leave.The location is absolutely amazing-across from a beautiful park, walking distance to the theatre district and a short subway or cab ride away from everything else.The car service they provided-Mario of EC Limousine-was consistent with the quality of the hotel. Restaurants they recommend -the same.I would NEVER even consider staying anywhere else in NY-Bryant Park is 7 star in every category. ',GOOD,
'Loved the small touches and the mystery envelope! This was my first trip to New York and I was fortunate enough to stay at the Bryant Park. Having travelled the world I'm well aware that finding a decent place to stay in the city can be very hit and miss, however this hotel exceeded all my expectations.It was very boutique, fashionably kitted out and provided us with everything we needed. The staff were courteous and friendly, (although we would have appreciated some more inspired recommendations for breakfast rather than the nearest tourist traps) and always on hand to deal with any queries. We didn't get a chance to experience the additional items in the mini bar, although we did have fun trying to figure out exactly what was in the mystery envelope. You'll have to stay here to find out what though! It was these small touches that set this hotel apart in my opinon from the bigger chains.Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to check out the restaurant (Koi) or Cellar Bar - but both looked popular and lively and this is something I would definitely check out next time in town.We were fortunate enough to get some pretty good rates at this hotel, but it is worth the money for the unbeatable location and quirkier feel compared to other similarly priced hotels. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Hotel Great hotel - such a good location and the staff were so fab! Got upgraded for free and felt very looked after. Booked by HotelRes Ltd in Cambridge, England.Definitely recommend to others wanting a great experience.AND I AM HARD TO PLEASE!! :) ',GOOD,
'An Amazing Weekend We are going to make this an annual trip to NYC. The hotel did everything right from meeting us at the door, to bringing us Champagne, to making sure everything in the room was just right. It was worth every penny and I would look into staying at the hotel. We picked one of the weekend packages which were nice because most of the other hotels we looked at didn't offer anything like this. ',GOOD,
'AWESOME MY family spent the weekend here for my 50 bday. we were treated like royalty. three awesome rooms all with park views. darren and somer from the front desked took care of all our needs and chris from sales made sure it all went smoothly. this hotel blows away any hotel in nyc. ',GOOD,
'My new favorite hotel in NYC I come to New York from L.A. about 4-5 times a year for business, and have stayed at virtually every hipster hotel the city - from the Soho Grand to the Royalton. The Bryant Park Hotel is by far the best! The service was unparalleled, the room extremely comfortable and the location very convenient for my fashion/market appts. My room was outstanding - had a gorgeous view of the park, huge windows for lots of natural light, and was very quiet. They also have a good-sized and well-equipped gym, which is open late.I'm not only planning on staying here exclusively for all of my future trips, but I'm going to host a few of my clients' appointments in the suites that they rent out for events. I definitely recommend! ',GOOD,
'nice hotel but wished for more.... After researching forever and deciding on a different hotel, I noticed a great last minute deal for the Bryant Park and was able to cancel the other res. and book this hotel. I had looked all through the reviews and pictures and knew this was going to be a really deluxe place to stay. We loved the location, Bryant park is beautiful and the architecture of the building is amazing. Check in was great and everyone was very accommodating and friendly. Checked our bags early and explored most of the day. Our room was 1102 on the back of the building and had no view whatsoever (I know, I know, not every room can have a view). The room was huge (especially by NY standards) the bathroom was really large too. OK, it is my own fault for not mentioning that we were on our anniversary trip...perhaps we would have had a better room. Now not to be a complainer but just to point out a few of the negatives (in my own opinion.of course)...The bed was really, really hard. I have a platform bed at home usually they have a nice thick mattresses on this type of bed. I even like sleeping on futon mattresses but this bed seemed more like sleeping on a cheap box spring type mattress..Some other review mentioned that the room seemed sparse and boring (my thought upon reading this is well, they just dont like the modern/contemp style) but upon staying in the room I also felt like it just needed some more style, some art, a red bedspread....something to make it seem more modern and chic than just sparse. Again, not a big deal just my opinion.Lastly being from Seattle (starbucks headquarters), I really really would have loved to have coffee in the room in the morning or at least available in the lobby (which there really isnt any sort of lobby). We tried to order cappucinos next door at the italian cafe and ended up with 2 black coffees...finally found starbucks on the other side of the park.So all in all it was a nice place to stay for the rate of $300 but I cant imagine paying $600+ for this room ',GOOD,
'Bryant Park Rocks! The staff @ Bryant Park are very attentive to detail and seem genuinely concerned with your satisfaction during your stay. They accomodated all our needs in a pleasing way. We enjoyed the Cellar Bar downstairs, too, and felt like we made friends in all arenas of the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Nothing Beats the Bryant Park Hotel Without a doubt, the best hotel in the city. I travel to the city often and have stayed in many of the fine properties in NYC. They Bryant Park is quietly elegant, and the service is first rate. The room was immaculate, comfortable and very spacious. The location could also not be more perfect. Since I am from LA, I was excited to see that KOI was also there. Excellent! I am hard to please, and I highly recommend the Bryant Park Hotel! ',GOOD,
'Awesome Suite in NYC We recently stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel for two nights. This was our 4th time staying at this property and we love it everytime. We had booked a junior suite and were upgraded to a full suite at check-in. The suite was on the 17th floor and faced the park. It was a one bedroom suite with a dining/living room combination. Each time we have stayed at the hotel I always leave there talking about the rain shower in the bathroom. It is not the most luxurious bathroom but the shower is incredible. The water pressure is the secret to the shower. I have traveled all over the world and have been to numerous spas and this is by far the most relaxing shower around. So after spending the day walking around Soho and the rest of the city it was extremely relaxing coming back to the suite and having a great shower. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and professional. This is a fashion/celeb hot spot and we are so not apart of that crowd. Even though we are average people we always felt welcome by the staff. We ate dinner at KOI, which is in the hotel, and found the food to be outstanding.This hotel is pricey;however, the location and the overall experience made it worth the expense. When we return to NYC we will stay there once again. ',GOOD,
'Loved it My boyfriend and I just returned from a 1 night stay at the Bryant Park Hotel, and we absolutely loved the hotel. We stayed Saturday night, and were looking for a fun, interesting hotel with a good, central location. The staff was courteous and they even upgraded us to te junior suite. The room was huge, and not even just NYC big- it was USA big! And, it seemed that everytime we left the hotel, someone took notice, and everytime we came back, someone had tidied up our room and left us something special. Oh, and anything that you could possibly want you will find either in your hotel room, or on the phone. Luxury shampoo, intamacy kit, even white castle could be delivered after hours (for a price). We will definitely stay at the Bryant Park Hotel again. ',GOOD,
'Best Hotel in NYC My husband and I stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel for a weekend getaway. We have stayed at numerous properties throughout the city and was pleasantly suprised at this hotel. From the moment we checked in, the staff was very accomodating and nice. We were upgraded and the room was very impressive.We will be staying at this hotel in the near future and want to pass on this experience to anyone looking to stay in NY.The hotel was in an excellent location and the park was my favorite spot to sit and have coffee in the mornings. ',GOOD,
'Great room and location! We stayed here for a wedding during Labor Day weekend. The lobby was chic and red. I really loved the decor. The rooms were tiny but comfortable and modern. I like the huge flat screen tv and the location. The club downstairs was nice to have a cocktail before turning in. We ordered room service and it came within 25 minutes. They had White Castle hamburgers on the late night dining menu. $22.00 for 6 of them. Worth every penny to have them delivered hot to your room. They give you a discount on parking if you get your ticket validated at a certain garage referred to guest. That was a plus. ',GOOD,
'The Rudest Staff Ever I was meeting someone at this hotel and sitting in the tiny lobby waiting and I observed the rudest staff treatment of a member of the public i have ever seen. this man, nicely dressed, came in to meet someone staying at the hotel. he asked to use the restroom and was told the one in the basement was closed and the one on the second floor was only accessible to registered guests. The security guard was aggressive and hostile. No customer service or graciousness here. Then I went and complained to the manager and they proceeded to defend their security guard, who then came over and started telling me I said something to other guest about using the other bathroom, which is not what I said. I told the other man he should talk to a manager. Well we both talked to a manger, the head of security and he didn't seem to care. They were just rude people. I sure will NEVER stay at this hotel. ',POOR,
'Safe, Clean and Courteous I needed to find a Manhattan hotel for seven employees (including myself) from Canada. Some only stayed a few days, others needed to stay on for three weeks. Because there was a group of us, I decided to try phoning hotels within a certain radius because the hotel rates listed on websites were astronomical. After two days of phoning I called The Bryant Park Hotel. What a find! Despite it being Fashion Week, they gave us a reasonable price. When I first walked into the Hotel upon arrival I was a little worried because of the nightclub feel of the lobby. Once I saw my room, my fears disappeared. Besides being very stylishly appointed, the room was clean, comfortable, and the bathroom was gorgeous. As it turned out, The Bryant Park hosted several of the fashion functions but that affected our stay very little. We just flashed our hotel keys and were whisked through the crowd at the door toward the elevators. I am a woman and tend to feel nervous staying in hotels alone. Not so at The Bryant Park. I always felt safe. I didn't get a chance to eat dinner at the Koi Restaurant but some of my co-workers did and said it was fabulous food - especially the fish.The hotel has a booming nightclub in the cellar but I never heard a peep from my room. It was nice and quiet. I believe they knew we were working so they put us at the back of the hotel where our only view was the brick wall of a building. However, when one of the fellows wanted to change to street view, that wasn't a problem. Overall a very positive experience. ',GOOD,
'Worth the Money Normally I don't like to spend a lot of money on a hotel room but felt like splurging this trip. I am glad that I did!! The staff was extremely helpful and professional. The room was a good size. The room had lots of extras (seating, stationary, printer and keyless keyboard, sound machine, stereo, and I can go on and on). I liked the fact that there were not only glasses in the room, but wine glasses and champagne glasses as well. I left my watch when I checked out and actually received it back! The location is great! Just staying in the hotel has enough entertaining for one night between Koi and The Cellar. Very Posh. When I asked a bunch of questions to the entertainment planners, they gave great suggestions and made my trip with the things they suggested. I would definitely recommend this to any friends going to NYC. The location is amazing too!! All around a great stay. ',GOOD,
'Amazing Location, Great Staff, Mediocre Rooms Stayed there for a recent weekend trip. The location is PERFECT, and within walking distance to theatres, restaurants, bars, and shops. Staff also was very nice. Guests are young, hip, and attractive. And the best part was VIP access, albeit expensive, Cellar bar. The only downside, which for me was a major one, was that the rooms were much like a Ramada Inn with an uncomfortable platform bed. Starting at $400+ a night, I think you might be able to find better for your money (i.e., Royalton, Hudson, or Dream). ',POOR,
'Great NYC hotel Stayed at the Bryant Park labor day weekend to attend the US Open. What a great experience! Perhaps it was because I received an upgrade to a suite, but from the moment I arrived until I had to leave, the staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the service excellent and the room fantastic. My suite overlooked Bryant Park, and if I had one issue, it was the noise from the preparations for Fashion Week, which is certainly not the hotel's fault. The suite was huge and very well appointed. The platform bed took a little getting used to, but once I did, it was wonderful. The living room had two lounges and a flat screen TV, as well as an iPod dock (as did the bedroom). The bathroom was well-fitted, with a separate soaking tub and shower. The Molton Brown products were a plus. As an example of the great customer service, while at the tennis matches, I decided to call the hotel and request that they book a car service back to the city. On about 2 hours' notice, and with several changes in the pick-up time (due to the matches running until after midnight), the staff (I wish I could remember their names) were most helpful and arranged for a terrific car service.This is a sleek, fashion forward hotel, not for those used to poufy sofas and chintz. It may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for a chic, lively place to stay in an amazing location, this may be the place for you. I will definitely return. ',GOOD,
'A Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful Hotel I鈥檝e stayed in NYC on many occasions and I wish I had found the Bryant Park Hotel earlier. I had booked two suites and both rooms were upgraded on arrival to corner suites. What a treat for my mother whom I鈥檇 taken to NYC for a birthday present. The rooms were beautifully clean and the maid service was outstanding. The bathroom was spacious 鈥?probably the size of 鈥榦rdinary鈥?hotel room in the city!We didn鈥檛 eat much in the hotel, however, the mini bar and ice bucket were constantly checked and restocked.Nothing was too much trouble for the hotel and I loved the younger style employees without a hint of stuffiness.A great location for visitors and in June the park was a great place to grab breakfast and read the papers on Sunday mornings. The park also hosted an event for Good Morning American which was fascinating to watch.I would like to thank the Bryant Park Hotel for making a great holiday into a fabulous holiday. We intend to return in December. ',GOOD,
'Can't wait to return! We have just returned from our honeymoon in New York and couldn't have chosen better! The atmosphere is sophisticated but relaxed and all the staff were very friendly and professional. They gave us 2 or 3 restaurant recommendations which were excellent plus a typical New York diner for breakfast which we frequented daily! The rooms were spaceous and modern and the bed so comfortable that we slept soundly every night. Being so central you feel you are only a short distance from anywhere in Manhattan. The park opposite was a haven amidst the New York hustle and bustle where you can relax at the outdoor bar or the restaurant next door, or even enjoy watching the locals play petanque! A wonderful stay - a big thank you to all the staff! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Hotel at the Park My wife  I have just returned fron New York this week and had a FANTASTIC stay in this hotel. We consider the location to be the best of all worlds as it is in the middle of all the action.The staff were very attentive and helpful whenever entering or leaving the hotel.We asked for a 'park view' and were not disappointed, the view was excellent. The room it's self was bright and bueatifully presented, the bathroom was large and well fitted out. One of the most entertaining futures for us were the lifts (elevators) you would have to be in one to get it!!!!!!All in all a wonderful hotel the we would recommend to anyone. ',GOOD,
'I love this place :-) Its a beautiful hotel. Perfect location - right on the doorstep yet feels like its off the beaten track!. From the moment we arrived we were met with helpful and considerate staff who made our stay fantastic. The rooms were really cool with everything you need and more - oozing with style and plenty of space. The cellar bar is also a great place to hang out for a late cocktail. I'm going back :-) ',GOOD,
'Walking distance to major attractions. Great New York hotel for being central to all the major sites. Walking distance to most things and Bryant Park is just opposite. We arrived after midnight on a Friday night( flew from San Fran.) We were met with a long queue of party goers waiting to get in the hotels door as there is a club in there that is a hotspot to go to.( I had no idea about there being a club in the hotel on booking, silly me!!) After travelling all day and being jet lagged, feeling tired, hungry, wanting a bath etc, it was not the best thing to be met with and we had to scramble our way into the entrance! When our luggage was taken into the hotel lobby on a trolley, one drunken young woman checked our luggage labels to see if we were anyone famous and was rather upset that we weren't!!! Staff were friendly, hotel room was lovely and big, rare for alot of New York hotels. Mini bar and room service menu was so over priced, not good when the hotel is rather expensive anyway. A complimentary bottle of water would of been a big plus point when most of the guests have probably travelled for hours (there is a shop a few doors away that sells snacks and drinks for a fraction of the price, turn right out of hotel entrance). Tv internet didn't work, after I was told it was on checking in, however there is a place a few doors away that has the internet by the minute ( turn left out of hotel entrance).Bath is big enough for two!!! Molton Brown products, me likey!!!They also have a Pleasure Chest catalogue of sex toys etc that was enclosed in an envelope and put on our bed!!!! Again after jet lag, at this point I thought I was hallucinating on seeing this, we had a good old laugh looking at it!though and it is now in our holiday scrapbook! We would certainly stay here again, room very comfortable and spacious, staff very friendly and helpful. Location is fantastic, saved alot on cab fares. Didnt hear any unwanted noise from the nightclub downstairs. View from room was directly onto scaffolding and a building site next door, but we don't go all the way to NYC to stare out the window do we?!!! ',GOOD,

'Everything Fabulous!       Bedroom ',GOOD,
'Cool Hotel This is a cool, small boutique hotel. The rooms are larger than in most Manhattan hotels. Our room had wood floors and it looked out at Bryant Park across the street (a small side street at that). At night, if you don't feel like walking any more, but you're not ready to be cooped up, the park is a very relaxing place to hang out and watch people (and drink cheap store-bought beer, although it's against park rules). The Koi Restaurant in the hotel is still a trendy place to be for locals, and it is an absolute madhouse from happy hour through 10 or 11 at night during the week. And the food is fantastic. If you want to be a tourist (which we were) the hotel is 5 minutes from Broadway and a short walk to the Empire St. Building. The entertainment director (the concierge) will book anything for you and make great suggestions for what's overhyped and what's not. The staff is cool, too. The pop singer Usher was staying at the hotel while we were there. The morning he was going to put on a free concert at the Park, which was our first morning there, having arrived the night before, there were crowds lined up down the sidewalk on both sides outside the hotel. We walked in and out of the hotel at least 5 times past the crowd, all of whom wanted to try to sneak into the lobby to see Usher, and the staff didn't give us a second look, because they memorized our faces when we walked out the first time. Great place to stay. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful New York Hotel       Bryant Park ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Location Just returned from 6 days in New York. Bryant Park Hotel is superbly located - it is lovely to walk out of the front lobby and see a green space amidst all the skyscrapers. The concierges were brilliant at organising taxis, places to eat etc and did not charge for the service. Our son celebrated his 21st whilst in New York and we were recommended Buddha Bar in the Meat Packing district - I have to say it's the best meal I have ever eaten in a restaurant and the setting is really unique. Koi carp pool at one end, low level lighting and a huge statue of Buddha. Would recommend the 2 day hop on hop off bus service to get a flavour of what New York has to offer. Don't forget if you shop in Bloomingdales or Macys go to the information desk to get an 11% discount card for UK visitors. Finally ,travelled with Continental from Bristol to Newark which proved to be a very good service especially the return flight on a newer plane with screens in the back of seats and a vast choice of channels to choose from if you couldn't sleep.

'Great Location; Clean and Pleasant Spent three days at the Bryant Park Hotel last week in one of their King Suites overlooking the park.The room was HUGE, well-appointed, and immaculately clean. The marble bathroom was the size of my first apartment! No problems with either the plumbing or air conditioning. There was some street noise, but that鈥檚 the price you pay for the park view. Unlike some hotels, the elevator and hallways were well lit.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful. No drama. No problems with check in/check out.

'A Terrific NYC Hotel We loved everything about our recent five night stay at The Bryant Park Hotel. The front desk, housekeeping, doormen and bellmen are friendly and knowledgeable, the room (junior suite) was large with big windows giving a great view of the park, the bathroom was spacious and luxurious and the hotel's location in NYC is in the center of everything. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel, Great location highly recommend Took the train from JFK and was in Manhattan in about 45 mins. Arrived after 3pm and really looking forward to chilling out but the room wasn't ready. Went into Bryant Park and there was a really nice open air bar. Once checked in, the room was great. A good size and plenty of room. Bath tub was massive and was really looking forward to jumping in but afrer 40 mins gave up because it wouldn't fill past about two inches. Staff were really friendly and helpful throughout.There is also a great bar down stairs whichs gets really busy late at night. Very popular with the locals.No coffee making facilities in the room but didn't feel too inconvenienced as a really nice place two hundred yards to the left of the hotel.The park opposite is a great place to chill out in too.Highly recommend.

'Hands down the best hotel in NYC My wife and I just returned from a stay at The Bryant Park Hotel. From the moment of arrival to check-out - every employee that we encountered was polite, courteous and attentive. I don't know what kind of employee 'kool aid' this place serves - but the service was over-the-top.Unfortunately due to a family emergency, our 4-day weekend had to be cut short into a 1-night getaway. The front office staff was extremely understanding and genuinely concerned. Even after checking out and arriving home the next day, the front office manager sent me an email to make sure that all was okay at home. Now that's the kind of service one would never receive from a large international hotel chain. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful stay, wonderful staff...can't wait to stay again My fiacee and I began our honeymoon in New York and looked around at properties that were somewhat trendy, but not over the top. The Bryant Park hotel fit that mold and we were able to get it at a very competitive price. The staff was incredible. Always polite, kind, and efficient. Then our room...amazing. Wonderful bathroom with soaking tub, separate shower marble/travertine tiles. Roomy bedroom with a classy and bright ambiance. Concierge requests and room service was delivered promptly and politely. I can't say enough about Bryant Park. I hope to go back (very soon!). ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel, Bad Service - Missed Wake-Up Call!       Toenail on the phone in the bathroom? ',POOR,
'This is a classy place! I booked my stay via Expedia and was a bit worried that I would be stuck in a broom closet room. Upon arrival, I asked for an upgrade to a room with a Park view and Dante was absolutely perfect in handling my request (kisses to Dante!!). Although my room was not ready when I arrived, there is absolutely no shortage to what one can do in Manhattan! I have visited many times and find enough diversions to occupy me until a room is ready! My room was immaculate, spacious with natural light. I don't mind the minimalist design; the limestone bathroom was amazing-- so much space. Separate soaking tub and large shower room with a poweful shower head (lovely Moulton Brown products); farmhouse style sink and lots of room for your stuff (2 rectangular tables) were much appreciated. Flat screen TV, BOSE equipment (radio and CD player) and an iPod hookup are provided. I don't watch TV, so this was not a necessity; loved the iPod hookup, though. Nightly turndown service is provided with chocolates and a sound machine by the bed. I found the staff to be friendly, hip and professional. I didn't go to the Bar or try the restaurant (Koi), so I can't comment on them. I did try their room service for breakfast and everything was delivered as requested and on time. I can't think of a more perfect stay with such a central location for everything. Very impressive! ',GOOD,

'For the NYC Visitor who is not a Tourist This is a fantastic hotel for those who visit NYC frequently and are familiar with the city. I would not recommend this hotel for first-time visitors or families. This is not the type of hotel in which you will find brochures for trips to the Statue of Liberty or discount fliers for Broadway shows. If you are in town to visit friends or family or to enjoy the restaurants, nightlife, shopping and culture of the city, this is a great place to stay for a number of reasons: (1) it is very centrally located, (2) it has a great bar, Cellar Bar, and a good restaurant, Koi, to bide time between events or otherwise meet up with friends, (3) the rooms are very spacious compared to other NYC hotels and in relation to the price and (4) service is quite good, especially the efficient check-in and the maids who kept everything immaculate without ever being seen or heard. I should also note that both the room and lobby decor is modern and minimalist in design and may not appeal to those who expect a more lavish setting for upward of $350 a night. ',GOOD,
'Stylish oasis of tranquility on a gorgeous park I had a great time during my first stay at the Bryant Park Hotel and recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable (yet not outrageously expensive) hotel in Manhattan.I stayed at the Bryant Park for one night at the end of May. The hotel is housed in a gorgeous black-and-gold 1924 Art Deco tower overlooking the leafy park. The location is perfectly situated between the subway lines for both the east and west sides of Manhattan. It's a short walk to Penn Station and an even shorter walk to Grand Central Terminal.I was warmly welcomed to the hotel by cheerful Anna at the reception desk. I had booked a Deluxe Queen View and was given room 1605, which wraps around the northwest corner of the building. The park views are gorgeous and worth the higher room rate. The room itself was spotlessly clean, with oak floors and modern furniture. The bed was very comfortable. Best of all was the palatial marble bathroom, with a giant tub and a separate shower fitted with a marvelous, waterfall-generating showerhead. The high-quality soaps and shampoo smelled great. I found the room to be an oasis of calm in the middle of bustling Manhattan.I did not visit the Cellar Bar or Koi, as I was meeting friends downtown the one night I was in NYC, but I did have breakfast and read part of the Sunday paper (provided by the hotel) in the beautiful park across from the hotel. It's like a little slice of Paris in Manhattan.I have searched long and hard for a hotel in Manhattan that's not prohibitively expensive but that also has style and a distinctive personality. With its historic exterior, elegant interior, central location, spectacular views and courteous staff, the Bryant Park will be my new home-base for future visits to New York City! ',GOOD,
'Absolutely wonderful stay The Bryant Park Hotel is a wonderful property found on the island of Manhattan. Being a native New Yorker (and living in Manhattan) I am very familiar with the typical hotels in the city and the bang you get from your buck. Stayed here on a Wednesday to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the Bryant Park was absolutely amazing. Upon check-in they upgraded my standard room to a suite on the 5th floor overlooking the park and sent up complimentary champagne. After check in a butler came and sent carmel popcorn to the room as compliments of the hotel. Even though the complimentary sentiments cost next to nothing compared to the room itself, they are all just very nice gestures that all hotels should accomodate to.The rooms are just beautiful, clean, and tres chic. Front desk was extremely helpful. Complimentary magazines by the elevator. And to make the birthday planning easier had dinner at Koi, which is a very pretty restaurant.Over all - Bryant Park hotel is a great place to stay in the city because its close to everything, but far enough that you won't be caught up on the touristy hoopla.Highly recommend ',GOOD,
'Great Service at the Bryant Park Hotel! This hotel is well-located in that it is right across from beautiful Bryant Park. On the weekend, this is great because it is off the beaten path (for NYC) but still very centrally located for getting around easily (especially because the BDFV is right out the front door). The hotel decor is modern and it is done well and the Molton Brown bath products are great. Most importanly, the staff at the Bryant Park Hotel renewed my belief that good customer service does exist. Everyone at this hotel was extremely friendly and gracious. They truly seemed to care whether or not we had a pleasant stay. Everytime we walked into the hotel, we were greeted warmly and we were asked (in a way that I felt was genuine) whether or not we needed anything. The staff actually wanted to be of service!In particular, I must give special praise to Frank at the front desk. He very graciously corrected a mistake in the type of room that we were assigned to and upgraded us to a junior suite that happened to be available. Moreover, when I told him that it was my spouse's 35th birthday, he sent up two cute individually-sized bottles of White Star.Like many who utilize this site, I have had quite a few hotel experiences, and I can honestly say that the service at the Bryant Park Hotel was the best that I have ever experienced.

'Great experience, with a few small gripes. My husband and I stayed (and are still staying) at the Bryant Park Hotel. We booked for a week. The hotel room is very very nice and spacious, and the location is perfect. However, next time I'm in NY, I would try one of the more 'traditional' hotels like the marriott perhaps... somewhere where the hotel staff are warmer and where the lobby feels more friendly... but that's just personal taste. Overall, the Bryant Park Hotel is great. I've listed some of my experiences below.Check-in: was quick, efficient, though impersonal. The lobby: Smart, clean and modern, but small. Was not quite comfortable - they've gone 'modern' and contemporary to the point you somehow just don't feel comfortable hanging around. There's no traditional lobby lounge or seating to wait or get cosy in. Room: Excellent size and furnishings, bed was comfy. Bathroom was big, clean and modern, and bath products were very lovely. We were on the 18th floor and it was pretty quiet. There was some reno being done in the top floors of the hotel but that didn't disrupt us much... only heard the occasional bump during the day. Only gripes are that the walls are waaaayy tooo thin (I can faintly hear next room occupant talking/watching tv. In fact, while I sit in the comfy bed typing this review, I can hear the room occupants next door faintly moaning and their bed squeaking from their evening exertions..... oh dear). Also, next room's door opening/shutting actually does reverberate through our room, which can be slightly annoying if you like to sleep in. The only bathroom gripe would be the shower - they have one of those 'rain water' drippy showerheads that means it's virtually impossible to have a quick shower.Doorman/men: are usually present and polite, but they don't do much. There are 2 sets of doors leading from the street to the hotel lobby. One set of doors is usually left open, and the doormen often just stand around chatting. Half the time, they do greet you. They are all dressed in black tees and pants and look more like bouncers than proper hotel doormen. Once you get through one set of doors, you normally have to open the second set of doors yourself, as all 2 or 3 doormen will be gathered only at the first set of doors chatting. House keeping: is EXCELLENT. Your room gets cleaned and tidied twice a day, and there's a privacy button should you wish. In the evenings, they turn down your bed, turn on the therapy machine (fills your room with soothing noises :), put choccies on your bed and positions slippers next to your bed, fill your ice bucket. It's all very very lovely!!In Room Dining: Too too expensive. Add 20% tax to cost of food, plus a $4 delivery fee. We had a turkey club sandwich and fruit salad delivered at midnight once, and it was of acceptable quality. We did dine at the Koi Restaurant downstairs one evening and the quality of the food was good. Service in Koi was standard (good), like you would get in most of Manhattan. The only downer at Koi was the very VERY FROSTY hostess who had forgotten how to smile, even when smiled at! She came across snobbish and cold, with not even a response to our goodnight when we left. To be honest, for Koi's prices, you would do better trying nobu / nobu next door / the london. The image Koi projects is also somewhat contradicting - for a restaurant that charges top price, they give you wooden 'takeaway' chopsticks. Also, the decor mixes casual bamboo with funky ceilings. It's not a cohesive mix. Internet access: They charge you for it, even though in the park across the road and the cafes next door, it's free. Makes you feel a little ripped off for what you already pay to stay there. Health club on level 5: Was great! They had a great range of equipment and the room was large. There were also towels provided there, a basket of apples, a water container, a TV, and a toilet just in case. It's clean, presentable, quiet - very user friendly. ',GOOD,
'Outstanding Hotel This hotel is absolutely outstanding. It's a block and a half from Times Square/Broadway and across the street from Bryant Park. The hotel is stylish and trendy. The rooms are big (for NYC) and comfortable, the bathroom is outstanding and super clean. You definately want to stay here. Room service is crazy expensive but there are nice, affordable places to eat 100 yards from the front door. ',GOOD,
'Modern stylish hotel Stayed at the Bryant in September last year. At check in we were told that our room was not available even though it was late afternoon. The staff member we were dealing with did not seen really that bothered, just continued with the same sentence of Im sorry we dont have the room available that you want without offering alternative. We had initially requested a room quite high up and the first one offered was only on the 3rd floor. Eventually after my partner complaining there was a room available that was higher and acceptable. The room itself was comfortable, bathroom was absolutely beautiful. Staff were friendly, apart from the encounter initially, good service with the concierge confirming our reservations for us, which I highly recommend if going for dinner at River Cafe or Rainbow Rooms. ',GOOD,
'Looooovely!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to write a review because I spent the last two months checking reviews about the hotel.So I guess other people do the same.This is the best hotel I've ever been to( I'm very picky!).Everyone was friendly,the rooms are BIG,the shower is huge and the bath is something else.The room service food was a bit pricey but my god...delicious!Eveything was clean and perfect.If this is your first time in NY don't just go up and down times square and fifth avenue like we did for 4 days(EXHAUSTED!)head downtown to Soho,they have amazing shops and restaurants,we found a seafood bar call Ed,the food here is great.Also Nobu never dissapoints. ',GOOD,
'Excellent customer service! My husband and I stayed at The Bryant Park over a weekend while in New York City for a friend's pre-wedding parties. Reservations via the hotel's website were very easy and user-friendly, and the concierge emailed to confirm the reservation, and again a few days before check-in as a reminder in case there was anything specific you might need help with (theater tickets, dinner reservations, etc.). When we arrived check-in was smooth and flawless, and everyone from the doormen/bellhops to the front desk receptionist were incredibly friendly, helpful, and gracious. We were upgraded to a larger room - very clean, large, king size bed, very large bathroom. Our room had no view, but that's not the hotel's fault - I did not request one, nor did I try to change rooms as a result. Great gym with modern equipment, water and fruit available. The location seemed excellent - close to shopping, the subway, and Times Square. There is a Starbucks and a few casual sandwich shops nearby. No really cozy restaurants for brunch or lunch that we saw in the immediate area, but then again, you are so close to the subway that it's really a non-issue. We didn't try Koi or the Cellar Bar, but from 4:30pm on, on Friday and Saturday, the lobby was crowded with people coming to the hotel specifically for those two spots - very impressive people-watching! I also have to say that it was wonderful to come back and relax at the hotel after a long day of window-shopping or walking all over the city - the room was definitely large enough and comfortable enough to feel a little indulgent and to feel relaxed. All in all, a wonderful stay in what definitely felt like a 4-star hotel, in large part because of the fantastic customer service. We would definitely stay here again. ',GOOD,
'Very Very Good       hotel at night ',GOOD,
'Great Place to Stay My girlfriend (now Fianc茅e) booked this hotel for my 30th birthday and we couldn't have a chosen a better place to stay!The location is amazing and our suite had amazing views over looking the park. We ate in Koi on our first night and the food was superb. Didn't order from the pricey room service menu as there are some lovely deli's just outside the front door!The staff are friendly and very helpful, even remembering it was my birthday after we'd been there for 4 days. Everything we asked wasn't a problem and the champagne they delivered to our room was a nice touch!The rooms are big, the molton brown smellies are very nice and the tub was brilliant!I would defo stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. ',GOOD,
'Good but not great We stayed here recently with our daughter whos 1, definitely not a baby or child friendly hotel but probably our fault for booking it. we had booked the suite 6mths previous and requested a crib. When the crib was on its way up to our room I got a call from a member of staff to tell me the crib would be provided on this stay but she was informing we it wouldn't be provided on future stays. i think they could have told us this on check out it just made us feel unwelcome and that they were tolerating our baby just this once.Also we got married in the hotel and friends from Ireland had rang the events manager and dictated a detail note to him to add to a floral arrangement they had delivered to our room. We never got the note and assumed the hotel just provided the flowers to every guest!!!! it was embarassing as we never thanked our friend until she mentioned it weeks later wondering why we hadn't said anything. Also we booked a suite and stayed here a full week and got married here so I think the hotel should have acknowledged this in some way.Overall pleasant stay room was big, light and spacious with amazing views. ',GOOD,
'All style, less substance I have a few issues here. Yes, the Hotel is beautiful to look at, and the cleanest I have ever stayed in. The bathroom was stunning, and the Molton Brown smellies were heavenly. However, it could have done with a few more Hotel-like touches.More seats in the lobby would have been good, especially when waiting for our room to be ready. Is a kettle in the room not fashionable these days? Was there any need for the lifts to be soooooo dark, that when opening the door into our very white room, I was temporarily blinded.An average hotel experience for the money. ',POOR,
'Essence of New York On my first visit to New York I was looking to stay somewhere central, not over the top expensive but still capturing the look and feel of what I expected New York to be. My experience at The Bryant Park Hotel fulfilled all of that. After a swift, efficient and very friendly check-in a fully featured room awaited me with all modern conveniences. The bathroom was great with very good Molton Brown products and big fluffy towels. The turn-down service at night was an added luxury. I would highly recommend this hotel and if I get the chance to go to New York again then this hotel will be my first choice of a place to stay. ',GOOD,
'Great Spot Great hotel Great staff Would stay again ',GOOD,
'Why go anywhere else? This was the best hotel i have ever stayed at, and i've stayed at to many to count. Although no pool, it was great for everything else! The staff were very polite and did everything they could to make sure you felt at home, they got us sold out tickets (together) for the Broadway show Wicked (which it terrific by the way). An out room was huge, and we didn't even get a suite! It was very modern and chic, quite artsy! The tv was a HD flat screen and was very great for listeing to music and watcheing very cheap pay per view movies! The beds were very comfy and there were great Molten Brown products to take home. Best place in NYC and we're going next year! ',GOOD,
'Excellence at The Bryant Park Hotel My wife and I recently spent four delightful nights at the Bryant Park. We are 57 and 67 respectively. We found the hotel to be quiet, intimate and upscale. The staff were professional, efficient, responsive, courteous and friendly. Our suite was bright, immaculate, spacious and quite comfortable. Room service was always prompt. The hotel is conviently located on 40th Street across from beautiful Bryant Park. The 'Grill' resturant is located on that site and served us a wonderful meal. The Bryant Park has our higest recommendation.ArthurChicago ',GOOD,
'Terrific Staff and Facility We just completed five days in the Bryant Park Hotel in a junior suite overlooking the park. The beautiful old exterior belies an ultra stylish interior. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet with every convenience. My wife has been smitten with bathroom envy. The chic Cellar bar was a very upbeat modern scene frequented by locals and a fun evening hangout. But I believe the factor that separates this property from many others is the terrific staff - from front desk to chambermaid everyone was quick with a smile, polite, attentive and well trained. They made the experience of an excellent facility into something more special. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to even my most particular business associates. ',GOOD,
'My Favorite Hotel in NYC I have stayed at every W Hotel in NYC, the Waldorf, etc ... This is BY FAR my favorite hotel to stay at in NYC. I always get the junior suite and it is beautiful. The location is awesome, the bar is super fun and it has been just perfect for me in every way. I cannot recommend it enough. I am very, very picky and I just love it! ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel My Wife and I recently stayed at the Bryant Park to celebrate her birthday. The Bryant Park staff was aware that it was her birthday and treated us very well. Check-in was smooth and our room was very nice -- larger than we expected and with a nice LCD TV (with some HD channels), Bose radio, and Klipsh iPod speaker system. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance to Times Square and the Theatre District but a little removed from the craziness of those areas. We would definitely stay here again unless we wanted to stay in a less touristy, more residential area. ',GOOD,
'great experience I researced hotels for new york for days on trip advisor and the reviews for this hotel were so good i booked it. I was a little worried about it living up to my expectations but it did. Its a trendy perfectly located hotel. We booked a deluxe room which was spacious had a view of the pack. I was so pleased that the reviews were spot it prompted me to write one!! ',GOOD,
'Awesome Accommodations My husband and I stayed at the Bryant Park hotel for a long weekend in February. We got a great rate and were very pleased with the service and accommodations!!!! Our room was quaint and sleek. (very new york mod!) The bathroom was very spacious! It was everything we needed for our stay in the Big Apple! ',GOOD,
'A great hotel I stayed here for 3 nights in Feb and had a fantastic time. The hotel is in a great location, and the building itself has movie star looks. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We booked a deluxe view but got upgraded to the junior suite, which for me was a near perfect hotel room. Lovely large bed, large room, a great TV and not too cluttered but not too sparse either. Also had a printer in the room which I think in todays world is a great addition to any room. Only issue might be that if you were staying for a long trip you may find the storage space for clothes a little limited.Bathroom carried on the trend of near perfection with a lovely bath tub and a good powerful shower and again nice and roomy.I didn't eat in the restaurant or go down to the cellar bar, but hope to do that next on my next visit.I haven't stayed in any other hotels in NY but have stayed in many around the world and this is definately up there and would be hard to beat. ',GOOD,
'Top Notch stay at The Bryant Park Hotel I booked the room in August 2007 for our stay of 4 nights in January 2008 - an email reminder was sent by the hotel a few days prior to our arrival, and this was the start of the excellent service my girlfriend  I experienced.We received a complimentary upgrade and the room (a deluxe queen) was spot on. Our room was on the 10th floor overlooking Bryant Park itself, the room was clean, furnished with a plasma tv, Bose clock radio, and ipod dock with a beautifully appointed large bathroom. The service at the front desk was excellent, and the room was turned down each night too.The hotel is situated perfectly for Times Square which is a 5 minute walk away, Macy's, Grand Central Station  the Empire State Building are little more than a 10 minute walk away.5th Avenue is just off 42nd Street itself and a deli called Pax 200 yards to the left of the hotel entrance served healthy breakfasts which set us up nicely for the day ahead.In short, this hotel, whilst not the cheapest option, certainly made our trip that much more special  we would certainly plan to stay there again when we look to head back to NYC in the not too distant future! ',GOOD,
'Enjoyed Bryant Park Hotel We had 3 great days in New York City. The Bryant Park Hotel is in a great location for sightseers. The subway is just at the end of the block. Unfortunately the ice skating ring in the park had just been dismantled and they were working day and night setting up tents for fashion week. There was noise from the construction-but not alot more than the usual street noise. The hotel provides ear plugs. The room was clean, comfortable and simply furnished. The bed was very firm and comfortable. Room service was courteous and quick. Patrick the door man was very helpful.We will defintely go back! ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel And Location Stayed here for 4 nts 24th - 28th Jan celebrating our daughter's 21st birthday.Staff very helpful for getting balloons and a cake ordered for the occassion,even gave our daughter chocolates and vouchers for a free drink in the Cellar Bar.They also recommended Phillepe Chow for a celebration meal which was lovely,pricey, but it was a special occasion,booking recommended as it was very busy it was Friday night.Hotel rooms very well appointed with a turn down service at night,and Molton Brown products in the bathroom which was huge,but windows in bathroom a bit draughty,needed towel at bottom when having a bath.We were on the 18th and 22nd floors no trouble with noise from the traffic below or the nightclub.Location very good only a few minutes walk from Times Square and the main shopping areas.Got a good deli right on the corner by the hotel called Pax which is good, as the only downside to the hotel is there are no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms or available at the hotel other than room service which is expensive just for tea and coffee around $20. ',GOOD,
'Star treatment This hotel is a gem. I normally stay at your typical chain hotels but wanted to try something different. This hotel stands out with its trendy lobby with its low lighting and club- like color scheme. The service is excellent from the valet to the front desk. Although I booked a lesser expensive room, I was upgraded without even being asked. Even at the check-in there is this sense of privacy. The location of this hotel is perfect. You are far enough from the Broadway lights etc but everything is in walking distance. Our dinner plans were on restaurant row and the walk was not bad at all even with the cold temps. The hotel room is simplistic white with bits of color for accents and felt spacious with the high ceilings. The bed is wonderful and comfy tons of pillows.. There is a sound machine in the room but the quality of the construction is quite good, so there was no outside noise. The bathroom is similiar to those you find in spas with great toiletries (molton brown). The bathrobes were super soft. Because the hotel is right in front of Bryant Park and nearby 5th ave, it adds to the overall image. There is a starbucks and various lunch places around the park. The Europa Cafe on 5th ave had great paninis ( a couple blocks from the hotel)This is a perfect hotel for couples, adults. This is defintely a hotel I will stay at again ! ',GOOD,
'Loved everything about it My husband and i (30 year old married couple and no children) stayed here for 4 nights over New Years - as someone else has mentioned we had a good view from our room of the Times Sqaure ball on NYE which was an added bonus ! Everything about the hotel was superb - we stayed on the 18th floor in a corner room and we couldnt have asked for anything better. We had just checked out of Crowne Plaza times square - luckily i didnt pay for it (i used reward points) but i am sure the price isnt that different to Bryant Park but the experience was worlds apart. The bathrooms were amazing, the beds were so comfy, the cd's were great and very relaxing to listen to having a relaxing huge bath and sipping champgane. There were so many nice little touches that made a big difference. Check out the red leather lift too - very cool i just wish it wasnt so dark in there so we could have taken photos ha! The only complaint we had was the room was a bit cold but we never really spent much time deciding whether we could to turn it up otherwise i am sure it would have been fine. Most of the doormen were very pleasant and friendly, as too were the reception staff but we rarely had much to do with them. The location is ideal - next to an excellent subway station and not far to walk into Times Square if you want to take in the atmosphere (or chaos). We ate once in Koi - fantastic food and service. My husband wasnt keen as me but thats because he is a meat  man where as i love fish (definitely try the Tuna on crispy rice and the black cod) it was superb. This was my first trip to NYC and i would find it very difficult to persuade myself to stay anywhere else. I think as someone has said before the lack of communal areas although not a problem for us is a bit unusual and i guess feels a bit strange. We did go to the cellar bar for one drink - it is a very dark place and the bar tender was a bit rude and we didnt stay for long. Overall Highly recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Loved every part of it We stayed here for a romantic break without the children in december. It is the best location and we looked out of our suite room onto bryant parks ice rink. Everything about this hotel states cool. The staff are cool, the building is cool, the cellar bar is cool you name it this hotel is cool. The food was lovely, the breakfast was huge and gorgeous with the breakfast waiter being particulary efficient so thanks for that. My only slight complaint would be that i asked the hotel to book us basketball tickets and they charged us 100 dollars per ticket to do so. This did upset me. Other than that the hotel is brilliant and i will without question book to stay here again. ',GOOD,
'wonderful stay This was a surprise for my 10 year old (birthday present) for us to go stay here with two of her friends, this was also so they could see the Good Morning America Hannah Montana concert right across the street at Bryant Park. The staff went out of their way to make sure the girls knew what was going on (yes she stayed there) and there wasn't a detail left. My daughter and her friends got to briefly meet Hannah Montana and get her autograph.The room was a deluxe that the staff upgraded, it was perfect. Out of all of the places we have stayed this is a perfect 5, I would give it a 10 if it went that high. There wasn't anything we could find even slighty disappointing even the room service was outstanding. ',GOOD,
'Fun Experience My stay here was great. I don't remember what type of room I stayed in but it was big but also sparse. It was definitely comfortable and I really liked the bathrooms. I find bathrooms to be very important to me when I book hotels and theirs was awesome. There's turndown where they move the gigantic pillows from the bed, turn on the sound machine, close the drapes and give you a pair of slippers. I loved how they provided an umbrella in your closet in case you didn't come prepared for unexpected rain. I thought the LCD LG TV was a bit small for the room and fell they should invest in larger ones. I definitely liked my stay. The front desk was nice and the bar at the hotel was great. I stayed on the middle floors so I couldn't hear the bar at all. What you should keep in mind is that there was a 150 extra hold on my card for the room which gets taken off. If you pay with debit, you'll see it in your statement if your on top of such things, but you won't see it if you pay by credit card. I had a good stay. ',GOOD,
'great view of the crystal ball on new years eve Fab hotel, although it didnt start to well, we booked one room with two queen sized beds and whoever was in our room decided to stay on longer, so we had to take two rooms instead. Not ideal at the time but propbably turned out for the best. Excellent location and spotless clean and trendy rooms. We had good view of the crystal ball at new years eve, that was a bonus, wouldn,t recommend this time of year to anyone with kids, absolutely chaiotic. ',GOOD,
'Outstanding! Will probably never stay anywhere else in NY again! Any hotel can have problems, and we ran into a few, but the night manager Shieshedo gave new meaning to the word hospitality! Aquarians unite! If Oprah knew about the Mr. Steam showers at the Bryant Park, it would undoubtedly make her Favorite things list. Very trendy, but warm and inviting at the same time.Beds extremely comfortable.Great sound system for docking ipod. Marble bathrooms have deep soaking tubs,a shower that has a floor to celing glass door with 2 shower heads (rain shower above, telephone shower mid-range) and a thermostat controlled steamer, allowing you to set time and temp!You can turn on the steam, pipe music into the bathroom and take a cool shower, all the while feeling you are showering outdoors in the tropics. My son, another aquarian, referred to it as being steam cleaned. The weather outside was cold and rainy, but the weather in the suites at the Bryant Park was heavenly!Do not take the Raymond Hudd suite unless you take both of them! Evidently they recently renovated and were unaware that in terms of noise, it was like sharing a room with your flooormate. (There are only 2 of these suites and they take up the entire floor.) They are beautiful and spacious, but have hardwood floors, causing the sound to travel easily from one room to the next. It would be ideal if you have friends or family in the other suite.My son and I had the misfortune to be sharing the floor with a couple who had a toddler. When we called the front desk about the noise factor, the day person told us they did not have another suite and the couple next door was checking out. We came home from the theatre the next night to find a note on our door asking us to keep the TV down because their baby was a light sleeper. (They decided to stay another night.) Evidently mom was not such al light sleeper however. When the baby woke me screaming at 4am I wanted to go pick her up myself it took so long before mom and dad got up to respond to her cries!The next evening we returned from the theatre to find the night manager at the front desk, with whom I had originally made the reservation. He inquired how things were going. I gave him an earful and the next thing I know we were upgraded to the Penthouse suite. It was spectacular! Evidently Leo Dicaprio's favorite haunt when he stays in New York.From that point on my entire impression of the Bryant Park changed from one of disdain to one of admiration for what they are trying to achieve by catering to a wide range of taste levels. Yes.It is very trendy. I am not particularly drawn to trendy. In fact I could care less. If that's your thing, you'll love it. Don't be thrown by the hip appearance of the staff in black. They are wearing uniforms and are there to to a job and most of them do it quite admirably. BPappealed to me as a single parent, traveling with a teenage son. I like to come and go unnoticed as though I were walking into the front door of my own home. The difference being that if the weather was too soupy to go out, I did not feel cheated stayng in the room relaxing until it cleared up. (In fact, upon my return home I started to redecorate my house because I enjoyed the minimalist aspect of the decor at BP.) We only ordered room service once. It was fine. Did not go to the Cellar bar, but clearly it attracts quite a crowd. We were there the weekend before Halloween. I had no idea there were so many nurses with a night life in New York! I walked past the eager young people hoping to get in, feeling grateful those days were behind me!My advice to you is stay here. I researched this trip weeks in advance. My biggest client owns one of the largest chains in the world. I declined to stay at one of their proerties because I wanted something different. New York is a veritable smorgasbord of hotels ranging from sleezy to sublime. I think I have stopped looking when it comes to New York. Going back to Bryant Park would feel like going home to a place of warm memories. Travel these days can bring an untold amount of unpleasant surprises. But the place where you rest your head at the end of your vacation day should bring you peace. I know I can count on that at Bryant Park. (By the way,The same can be said for Sofitel Water Tower!)Ps. Can't find the camera. Will upload photos later. But for a true represenation, go to the five star alliance website. They look exactly like the room we were in. Bon Voyage! ',GOOD,
'Poorly Managed, Uncomfortable The Bryant Park has a prime location, a hip vibe, and large rooms, but I will never, never stay there again. Our street-facing room, with a view of the park, was so loud (although it was high enough that one would expect otherwise) that we could not sleep. It should have been a red flag that the hotel provided two sets of earplugs with the bath amenities, yet no shower cap! First there was the pounding music from the bar downstairs, which carried up more than a dozen floors. Then there was the night street construction and related car horns. In fact, the hotel's windows are of such poor quality that just the ambient city noise was too much to bear, and the winer cold came right through the glazing. Since our room was nearly $600 a night, it's reasonable to expect insulated windows with thick curtains that buffer noise and cold -- as most hotels at this price point would provide. The Bryant Park has sheer curtains with roller shades beneath them, which is in keeping with their minimalist look but is an absurd choice of style over the comfort of their guests.As for the minimalist thing, it only works if materials are of the highest quality and are well maintained. Our room had three boards raised and partially detached from the floor, and both the veneered desk and table were badly water damaged. The travertine marble in the (large) bathroom was chipped and grimy at the grout joints. Poorly done caulking ran around the edges of the bathroom, and gaps had opened up around the tub. Water leaked from under the shower door, so that we had to mop up a mess every time we showered (good water pressure, though). There was rust and corrosion from the leak at the door hinge (very ugly) and mildew had invaded some of the unmaintained grout joints in the shower. Most of the towels were worn enough that if they were in my home they would have been relegated to the dogs. The floor had been treated with a glossy sealant that just accentuated the poor condition of the stone. Although the Molton Brown toiletries (just the basics) provided are of good quality, the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were not replaced when more than half empty. Most hotels provide extras when they see that the products have been used. You should not have to ask.It concerned me, too, that the bath tub was extremely slow to drain. This indicates clogged plumbing, which is very unsanitary.Housekeeping is uneven. There was dust under the sofa, and the aforementioned mildew in the shower. The area rug (supposedly Tibetan but of an acid purple that would never appear in a true, naturally dyed Tibetan rug) was poorly vacuumed. The extremely firm bed was nicely made up with good quality sheets but medium quality pillows. Nothing is provided with evening turndown (no bottled water or chocolates), and we did not even have the evening service most of the nights we were there because the maid came by (inexplicably) at 6:00 or 6:30, just when guests are most likely to be in their rooms getting ready for an evening out. Furthermore, the maid pounded on our door before 8:30 one morning! I learned to use the privacy button after that. Even the main lobby was poorly cleaned. While I was waiting to check out I noticed dark splash and drip marks down the side of the red lacquered concierge desk. Whatever had spilled had been only partially wiped off. Things like that make one doubt the cleanliness of the entire hotel.The too-popular bar downstairs is a problem for hotel guests, aside from the noise that assaults you when you enter the hotel lobby. Guests must show their key cards to a guard to access the hotel elevators, and we often had to push through a crowd of rowdy bar patrons to get into and out of the entry lobby (which is darkened, club-fashion). When we returned to the hotel late on a Friday night, we encountered a very drunk bar patron and her two friends having an argument in the lobby (right in front of the elevators). No hotel employee was there to control things and, oddly, the fellow who usually guarded the elevator bank was gone (just when he was needed).It's evident that The Bryant Park attracts a certain crowd, and it's possible that I am simply not in their demographic. But all hotels are managed in the same way, and my conclusion after spending several nights here is that this is a poorly managed hotel. Uneven housekeeping, poorly maintained facilities, and the choice of style over the comfort and convenience for guests -- all add up to a hotel that I will avoid in future. ',POOR,
'Draconian cancellation policy Please be aware of the very unpleasant cancellation policy of the Bryant Park. I needed to cancel my reservation with just 24 hours' notice. I would not have complained about a reasonable cancellation charge.However, I am being charged for a full one night's stay, because I did not give at least 48 hours' notice before cancelling. This, of course, amounts to hundreds of dollars, because I had booked a junior suite for myself and my two teenagers. ',POOR,
'Wonderful weekend getaway, perfectly clean!       Views from the park ',GOOD,
'Perfect Hotel For a Trip To Manhattan The Bryant Park Hotel is a great hotel. It is in a central location...right across the street from Bryant Park. There are plenty of restaurants withing walking distance of the hotel...not to mention, some very good late night eateries. The staff at the hotel are very helpful and friendly. And the rooms are amazing. I really like minimalist decorating, and i thought it was great to see a room that had the very least that you need. Its basically a bed, a tv, a closet, and a bathroom. However, they pull it off very well....and with class and style. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any of my friends and family. ',GOOD,
'Great location, good room with facilities nearby. I'm not sure that I can add so much, but nevertheless...The hotel is in a great location. By Bryant Park subway and equi-distant from Times Square  Grand Central, you are very close to excellent public transport as well as the location between 5th  6th meaning you can easily hail a cab up or downtown.Bryant Park itself is lovely and holds an ice-rink in winter and concerts/ films in summer. The direct vacinity has also improved in recent years, so there are now some nice delis and patisseries near to the hotel. This is good, because the hotel has limited facilities. There is a very trendy bar (more a nightclub) and very chic restaurant. Both are quite well known, but not necessarily what you want/ need from a hotel.The rooms are a very good size for New York (read standard by US standards) and have all mod cons. I easily set up my laptop, plugged in my i-pod, flicked on the telly and mooched around in my bath robe. I was also surprised that I liked the decor - which look rather cool on the website but I thought worked well in real life. Indeed, it made a great NY apartment for my stay.The downside, I think, is a lack of basic hotel facilities. There is no real communal area. When I returned at 5pm on my last day to collect my lugage (having checked out earlier) I was told that there was no bathroom. After what can only be described as a farcical conversation with the Front Desk, myself and the man who guards the lifts from non residents, I was allowed to visit the bathroom in the nightclub. (I had to point out that they clearly did have a bathroom and then on finding the restaurant only opened at 5.30, the guard man said that I could not visit till then....).I then had half an hour to wait for my car service and spent this sitting on a window ledge in the lobby. The lobby is functional (for checking in), looks great, but realistically, I would have liked a seat and a coffee. So if the room and location matter it is great and I'd suggest better than many of its boutique counterparts. If facilities matter, I'd suggest elsewhere. On a personal note, I'd recommend it to a friend who knows NYC, but I'd send my Mum to the Pierre. ',GOOD,
'Bryant Park Hotel -- Perfect ! The Bryant Park Hotel is the best NY hotel we've ever stayed in. The Bryant has a contemporary look and feel. The rooms and bathrooms are larger than we've experienced in other NYC hotels. The hotel was immaculate, not only in the lobby, but in the hallways, room, and bathroom; not a fingerprint around doorknobs/locks and light-switches was seen. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating, and not in the have to be kind of way, but sincerely, like they really enjoyed people and their job. The location of the hotel, right off 6th, across from Bryant Park, is perfect - just close enough to the center of things without being in the noisy middle of it, and my daughter and I felt completely safe in this neighborhood. If driving into the city, you get a very reduced parking rate at a garage 4 blocks away - a closer one would be nice, but for $22 for 24 hours and a very nice and professional staff as well, the walk was worth it. And the room rate, they vary so search online - hotels.com worked best for us this time. ',GOOD,
'Stylish hotel, amazing beds and bathroom! This is a very hip hotel, but not snooty. It has a great location right across from beautiful Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. It's in a gorgeous historic building just off Fifth Avenue. The interior is completely modern and stylish. There is a famous painting of this building by Georgia O'Keeffe. It's called The Radiator Building at Night. I loved my guestroom overlooking Bryant Park. Very comfortable bed, big flat-panel TV, great sound system, ample closet space, lots of windows. Even a sound machine to cover up the noises of the city. The bathroom was incredible: Great big tub for long bubblebaths, separate shower with invigorating water pressure, fragrant Molton Brown toiletries, thick towels, even a view of the city while brushing my teeth! ',GOOD,
'great location, but thats about it. My husband and I have jusy returned from a four night stay in the Byrant hotel,we chose it after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor.The location is fantastic and the rooms are well laid out very well serviced etc. I would not reccomend this hotel because of the snooty attitute of quite a few of the staff which made it very uncomfortable, it was not a hotel to relax in just one to be seen in if you were of a certain age and dressed in a certain manner. ',POOR,
'Didn't live up to the hype. Lack of attention to detail. We chose this hotel for our recent long-weekend trip to NYC based on the multitude of 5-star reviews on numerous sites, unanimously praising the attentive service and room amenities at this hotel. On the bright side: the valet attendant and bellman did live up to expectations, the main shower head was heavenly, and our room was in a secluded corner on the 16th floor with a fabulous view of Times Square. They provided a noisemaker, Bose alarm clock, iPod speaker device, flat-screen TV, fax machine, very basic hair dryer, and nice roomy safe. They also provided a plastic-wrapped Rubbermaid mat for the shower which is reassuring for sanitary reasons. The location was fantastic, with a subway entrance just a few doors down, much closer than it appeared on the map. And the room furnishings were a bit more sterile than they appeared on the website, but the room itself was spacious and impeccably clean.Disappointing: Several of the front desk attendants gave off a snooty vibe, both in person and when calling the desk. The hand-held shower head had poor water pressure and lots of mineral deposits, making it nearly useless. The bed was uncomfortably hard and the total opposite of luxurious - we asked for a mattress pad and they added a super-thin layer under the sheets which did not help much at all. The 'entertainment planner' kept me waiting on hold then forgot my question not once but twice, and by the time they got back to me with info regarding jazz clubs, it had just become too late to make the show. The lighting in the bathroom was inadequate, and the main light was blocked by the makeup mirror which is just poor design. The temperature controls in the room were imprecise and had us waking up to adjust it several times each night. My iPod would not fit into the tight connection port on the speaker box, and the flat-screen TV was misconfigured so everything was stretched out and pixelated. (Not a big deal as we didn't travel to NYC to be couch potatoes, but it just shows lack of attention to detail.) They provided 4 plastic-wrapped Q-tips which I thought was a nice touch, but then did not bother to refill them when they were gone. Our first morning there, we were rudely awoken by loud noises of walkie-talkies right outside our door - right around 7AM - despite the 'do not disturb' light being on. Regarding the gigantic palatial bathroom (their 'killer feature'), I should mention that within the last month, we stayed at the Soho Met in Toronto, which boasts a bathroom with the identical configuration, which we loved and were looking forward to experiencing again. (Looks like the Four Seasons has the same one too.) However, the Bryant Park's version is in fact a slightly inferior copy - no heated floors, much poorer lighting, non-functional hand-held showerhead, clumsily-placed sink faucet, and a plain tub faucet instead of hand-held. It was a definite disappointment despite its acknowledged enormous dimensions for midtown Manhattan. Sometimes it's not just about size though.So, to recap: snooty / inefficient service, lack of attention to detail, and disappointments everywhere. Would I recommend it? Only reluctantly due to the great location and spaciousness - just don't expect anything mindblowing for the money and you should be okay. ',POOR,
'Perfect weekend at a perfect hotel As a travel agent for the past 30 years, we are always looking for a hidden gem and this is it. The location is perfect. The staff was wonderful. (special thanks to Chris-manager, Paul in reservations, Loretta in accounting- I talked to them so many times before arriving -I felt like we were family). Justin and Lloyd were excellent bellmen -with loads of information.Please keep in mind we were 2 women traveling with our kids-ages 11 and 15 and they LOVED it. This past weekend was a little cloudy and rainy and taxis were just not available. We were able to walk (or subway) everywhere. (Subway station three doors down).Three years ago we stayed at the Plaza and thought that was a great location--this beat it by far. Bryant Park is very charming and right across the street. PAX -great deli food- down the street . The rooms were spacious, neat and clean. Special thanks to the hidden maid for room 1502.Try Da Nico's in Little Italy for great food at an affordable price. Take the subway train F to SOHO to enjoy a new shopping experience. Little Italy is great but Chinatown for purses is very overwhelming and not at all a bargain. The purses are just not that great anymore and look fake--so we pasted on those.Don't just take my word for it--the next time you are planning a trip to NYC -try this great little hotel. (no big lobby--but who stays in their hotel lobby when they are in Manhattan.) Bryant Park Hotel----see you again in 2008!!! ',GOOD,
'The Bryant Park Hotel Sublime Contemporary Style There is only one place to stay when visiting Manhattan New York, The Bryant Park Hotel situated next to the New York Public Library, 5th Avenue and the most chilled well thought out park space equal to to the best in any city in the world, the Bryant Park. The hotel is housed in the 1924 American Radiator building with its coat of black volcanic coloured walls and hair of gold trimmings on its gothic styled rooftopThe Bryant Park Hotel operation comes into action the moment you reach the entrance, with very helpful staff taking your luggage and welcoming you to its establishment. Upon entry, you enter a small lobby, which was designed with a sophisticated knowledge of interior design contrasting dark walls and red furnishings, which compliments each other extremely well. At the reception desk the staff, dressed in black smart uniforms greet you with a welcome smile and guidance upon checking you in.To go to your designated room, you walk a dimly lit walkway with a LCD TV screen showing the latest fashion shows with fashion magazines neatly laid out to flip through. Then you enter a darkly lit music accompanied background music elevators, which intensify the mystery of what to expect when you reach your room. I stayed in a junior suite and let me tell you, they identify this hotel as boutique, but in terms of space the room compares well to any large traditional hotel room your ever likely to visit. However, that is as far as comparisons go, for the interior was bright, airy with hardwood flooring, quality minimalist but practical and very comfortable furnishings, sumptuous beds and bedding all made from high quality material, large LCD TV and Bosse CD player. The bathroom has lots of lighting, marble, very large mirrors, lots of counter space, walk in glass door shower and lots of towels for various types of uses and not forgetting complimentary bath robes and slippers.The Bryant Park Hotel facilities also include the world-renowned very fashionable Koi restaurant with its sushi and fusion Asian cooking, which is an elevated experience not only in terms of your taste buds but also where your latest designer outfit compliments the decor and ambiance. There is also the Cellar Bar with its dark cavernous space, which is an upmarket club in itself, maintained by very attractive staff who serve great cocktails and supply fusion of music from rock to RnB to Hip Hop to classic Pop.This hotel was not designed for the masses, but for the truly sophisticated fashionable artistic elitist among us who know sublime contemporary style when they come upon it, that being The Bryant Park Hotel.

'fab hotel - great location Hotel is on the best small park in manhatten mid town and right where you need to be for exploring the city. The hotel is very individual and is has a really cool feel to it, no clutter, rooms are simply fitted out but stylish.Great beds, cottons, bathroom with huge bath and power shower. We had a junior suite, with good lounge area, plasmas wi fi and all the stuff that you expect to be there - is! Staff are discreet and helpful, cellar bar is great, but can be booked out privately quite often. If you are a Hilton, Marriot, bed in a box fan then give it a miss. ',GOOD,
'Amazing Location - Funky Hotel - Great Experience A great stay at the Bryant Park Hotel.We were in New York for only 4 days, so wanted a place that was as central as possible - we really couldn't have done much better! As you can probably gather from their website - Bryant Park Hotel is very trendy, red-lit lifts, funky music in the Lobby, doorman that look more like bouncers (though were very pleasant) and lots of subdued lighting. If that's not your thing - I'd think carefully about booking here. There's even a late-night party menu of sushi and White-Castle (amongst others) which is guaranteed to appeal to the more hardcore party animals. I'm pleased to say however that this didn't mean the hotel was noisy through the night.The staff were great, though only 1 out of the 2 Concierges we met were particularly helpful / knowledgeable. However the front desk staff made up for it, helping us out with online airline check-in, printing boarding passes, looking after our luggage once we'd checked out, letting us use the fitness centre bathrooms to freshen up before our flight (9pm so we'd spent the day out after checking out in the morning) and just generally being helpful. Also there's two room services a day, as with many big-city hotels these days. We even had a third service on request one day which was nice. Rooms are great - very modern with LCD TV's and gorgeous, well equipped bathrooms. A minor niggle was that there was no free Internet access, with the hotel charging about US$10 / day for the service. That's outdated guys! Also - breakfast was pretty pricey, I'd recommend an amazing patisserie which was about 3 doors away (out the front of the hotel and go left) which did excellent pastries  coffee. Location wise - brilliant, on the corner of 5th Ave  40-42nd St, you can walk to Times Square in 5 minutes, Rockefeller Centre in 10, Grand Central in 10, both Macy's  Saks in 10. Plus you're within 10 minutes walk of nearly every major Subway line. Can't do much better!We both loved this hotel, my girlfriend has already said she'll be back to stay there for her Hen weekend in a few years time! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Hotel/Service and Location! We stayed at the Bryant Park just a week ago and wish we were still there! Having been to NYC a few times, this was by far the best hotel and indeed location. We were greeted with slick and friendly staff who checked us in quickly and could not do enough to help us throughout our 4 day stay.We stayed in a Deluxe room which was excellent, minimal and top quality in every way. A luxurious feel bathroom with Molton Brown products and loads of space throughout. The hotel was extremely quiet particularly for such a central Mid Town location, it was a haven from the craziness outside. The Hotel's Cellar Bar was a great place to start your evening with once again great service.In terms of location it couldn't have been better, walking distance from all the Mid Town sights and sounds, a Subway station 30 seconds away to easily get around the rest of Manhattan, and fronted by the lovely Bryant Park itself. Overall we could not fault anything, it was an excellent trip, NYC was as exciting as ever, and the Bryant Park Hotel was simply spot on, we will definitely be going back there. ',GOOD,

'An elevator like a tiny bordello, but otherwise thumbs up! First and foremost, do NOT order the room service pancakes. I know, sometimes it's early, and you're starving and already late, and you think , oh, how bad can those pancakes be? They're like $99! They have to be at least okay! Wrong wrong wrong! Dinner service (from Koi) was a zillion times better, though portions were on the small side.The hub and I checked in with our toddler the day after Fashion Week ended. The staff was very nice the whole time. Let me tell you something though - don't book a room located at the front of the hotel for the day after Fashion Week, or whenever they're setting up/taking down something in the park. It is crazy noisy. I'm used to city noise, but it'll definitely bother folks who aren't. Someone commented that the sound machines in the room seem cheesy, but they're there for a reason - you'll drop to your knees and weep with gratitude when you need them! Granted, we were on the fourth floor right by the park, so all the action was right there.I liked the Molton Brown bath amenities, but they weren't replaced the second day, which was a bummer, 'cause hey - Molton Brown! This is perhaps because there's a shelf of Molton Brown for sale in your bathroom, conveniently enough. The bathrooms are huge and amazing: marble everything, deep tubs, rainspout showers, or whatever those are called.I find it amusing that the hotel sells sex toys but doesn't stock them in the room; you have to call down and have someone bring the stuff to you, which seems like it would be awkward. There are scads of free magazines by the elevators wih titles so hip I've never heard of them. Security is pretty good; you have to flash your key in order to get upstairs. The elevators are hilarious: tiny, dark and lit red, club music that sounds like it's playing in a tin can. The rooms themselves are spacious and lovely. We got the room a level up from standard, and it felt like a junior suite with a sitting area and big foyer. Again, the staff seemed genuinely pleasant and were always helpful and nice to interact with. Great hotel, but somewhat of a splurge. ',GOOD,
'favorite ny hotel I stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel for 10 days in April for a special occasion and then have stayed there since about 5 more times. This is my favorite NYC hotel. The front desk personnel to the handsome men who open the doors and take your luggage to the sweet and accomodating housekeepers are all incredibly helpful and professional. The rooms are chic and modern and include nice little extras like privacy buttons right next to your bed and your choice of falling asleep to the sounds of ocean waves or soft rainfall. Most rooms have beautuful views of Bryant Park. The bathrooms are large and sleek with rainshower heads, deep tubs and the most wonderful Molton Brown bath products. The bathrobes are soft and the LIGHTEST hotel bathrobe I've ever worn. You know how you wear a hotel bathrobe and it's so heavy and uncomfortable you'd rather wear nothing? These robes you will want to buy. There is a wonderful Japanese restaurant and a classy night club right on premises. I love this hotel for its location, its look and feel, but mostly because of the wonderful, happy and professional staff in every department! ',GOOD,
'Book this hotel today. Over the years I have stayed in so many lovely hotels in Manhattan I feel a little jaded. Yet, mention the Bryant Park Hotel and I feel giddy with excitement.

'Fantastic Stay and a Great Location for the Money!! I can't say enough about the staff at this hotel. They really make you feel welcomed and are extremely attentive. And, the rooms are spacious with very large bathrooms. This is rare for New York City where the standard m.o seems to be small, smaller and smallest. My room had an Ipod docking station, flat screen t.v and a very comfortable bed. For the price, you can't beat it and I would absolutely stay there again. You are only a few blocks from Broadway and Times Square but the property is tucked away on a side street that is quiet and peaceful. I've stayed at other trendy spots such as the Hudson where the staff definitely sports an attitude. You will not find that here. This is a hidden gem and I will definitely return to the Bryant on my next trip to New York. ',GOOD,

'I Heart Bryant Park Yes i spent many hours searching for the best hotel deal in NY, what with this being my first time there and all. I was worried about being in the right area especially because I was a female travelling alone. I arrived at the BP late on Thursday night (coming from London) and had pre arranged a massage in my room. Fab! went straight to sleep after and this meant I awoke nice and early and was able to go across to the park and see John Legend play for the summer in the park shows. It was such a great atmosphere. The hotel room was definately big enough (i had a standard room) and the bed was amazingly comfortable. I didnt hear any noise from the bar below (had been worried about this before arriving). Everything i needed was there, and the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. I could only book 4 nights here and then the other 5 i stayed at the Casablanca, which was also great but i kind of wish i could have stayed at the BP the whole time, as it was probably better for a single 30 yo woman, and the other hotel better for families/couples. I also loved the Pax food shop on the corner, great for getting breakfast and going to sit in the park! Great experience at this hotel and would love to stay there again. By the way, i paid $295 pl tax per night and at this time of year was good enough compared to some other 4/5 star hotels. ',GOOD,
'Perfect location, great value Although I'm not that familiar with New York prices, this hotel seemed very reasonable for a 4* in midtown Manhattan: we paid approx GBP125 (USD240) per room per night for a 'Superior' room (booked as a package via Expedia). Not sure if they're always that competitive but it seems so based on other reviews. For the price you get a great location: obviously midtown Manhattan is convenient (the Villages and Soho to the South, Central Park to the North, Broadway theatres and Madisson/Park Avenue shops on the doorstep etc) but this hotel's biggest advantage is Bryant Park itself, one of New York's finest. Well manicured, cultured and calming, largely due to the spillover from the city's beautiful public library that occupies the eastern end - it's a great retreat at any time of the day. Apart from the benefits of its location, the hotel also has a lot of style: an historic skyscraper (Art Deco) painted in black with gold highlights; a hip and young crowd in the cellar bar (maybe too young?); attentive and friendly staff. The room we had was great too but partly because we got lucky - our window opened onto a terraced area with a table and chairs (only a few floors have these, ours was on the 14th). The room was in the 'Superior' category (the lowest) which was a good enough size (but may have felt small without the terrace) and had all the amenities you'd expect of a modern 4*: flatscreen TV, luxury toiletries (Molton Brown), bathrobes, minibar with ice bucket etc. All in all, I rated this hotel very highly. The staff were great - very responsive to any request and almost always friendly (that's special for New York!). It has a great midtown location with a charming park immediately opposite (which reduces the noise levels, also special for New York). With all this, the room rate represented great value. ',GOOD,
'Favorite Manhattan Hotel!!!! I visit New York City at least once a year and I wish I had known about this hotel sooner! The other hotels I have stayed in are The Waldorf Towers, The St. Regis, The Marriott Marquis, and The Ritz-Carlton Central Park. THIS hotel tops them all! Love the location - right in the center of Midtown, LOVE LOVE LOVE The Bryant Park across the street. The entire park has wireless internet, four refreshment kiosks which serve breakfast, many lunch and snack selections including delicious hot pastrami on rye and signature salads and soups, smoothies, many coffee selections, etc, etc, an old fashioned merry-go-round, four acres of beautiful shady landscaped park complete with spraying fountains and plenty of tables and chairs so that everyone can find seating somewhere in this peaceful oasis in the center of all the noise, bustle and madness that is Manhattan. Since the hotel is across the street it too shares this same peaceful feeling - approaching the doors of the hotel (which are always attended by very fun and friendly doormen who go out of their way to be helpful and make you feel welcome -and who always remembered our names) you immediately begin to feel the calming effect the shady green park provides this very lucky street in Midtown. Its like finding a special escape every time you return to the hotel.Now for the rooms - WOW - I had a junior suite, huge, with gorgeous decor and hardwood floors, floor to ceiling windows (our ceiling had to be 12 feet high at least) a huge huge huge terrace, and a bathroom that is UNBELIEVABLY HUGE the shower is big enough for two people, the tub might just be big enough for three people! wonderful Molten Brown toiletries, fabulous beds and pillows - just an amazing room. I could go on and on. The location, room, service and attention to detail make this hotel an exceptional value - I highly recommend it ! Oh, and the dark elevators with the techno music are a very cool and trendy touch! Enjoy this wonderful gem! ',GOOD,
'Fantastic hotel and service Stayed at the Bryant Park for a week as a tourist and thought this was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming, the front rooms are spacious and have a phenomenal view of Bryant Park and the location is perfect for visiting Manhattan.The nice touches really made the stay, from the luxurious bath and shower to the incredibly helpful concierge / entertainment planners (thanks Marco!) who recommended genuinely great places to go every day.The only thing I didn't like was the internet in the room - the in-built browser is a bit old so to check emails we had to use a kiosk a couple of doors down.I doubt the feel of the hotel would suit all - it feels like a very trendy bar - but as a young couple staying in NYC for the first time it was perfect and next time I'm in New York (business or pleasure) I'll definitely stay here. ',GOOD,
'Trendy hotel Great location, beautiful interiors. I stayed there twice once as a tourist in NY and once in June 07 when i was in NY for business and i didn't think there were set up for business traveler. I called at 6 a.m and asked for an iron and i left my room at 7 and the iron was not there yet. Internet conncetion was very bad and no one there to help. I couldn't check my email for 2 days i was there. As a tourist the first time i loved it, everything was great. ',GOOD,
'Great experience The customer service at this hotel was excellent. The reservations staff were professional, friendly and attentive to details. The Entertainment Planning/Concierge was also very helpful and took care of all our requests. The rooms were spacious, clean, high-tech, and quiet. The Cellar Bar was a great spot for a late night drink - very hip. Location of the hotel is one of the best in the city - we would definitely go back. ',GOOD,
'Just Wonderful! We booked a block of rooms at the Bryant Park for my daughter's wedding. Everyone was thrilled with the spacious rooms; the beautiful views of the Park; the high tech gadgets and best of all the central location. It was an easy walk to theatre, Museum of Modern Art, and Fifth Ave. shopping. Thank you to the kind concierge staff for putting up with all our wedding frenziness. I know that all our guests will return to the Bryant Park for future New York visits. ',GOOD,
'Definitely worth the money!! I have stayed at many hotels, and I give this one the highest rating. At the end of a busy day in New York City, we looked forward to returning to the hotel. It was trendy and calming, with a peaceful, clean, minimalist furnishing style. Fun, professional doormen offered a personal greeting at the door welcoming us back. The hotel has all the comforts you want - amazing hot showers, a deep soaking tub and updated electronics. The bed and sheets were amazing!! We highly recommend it!! ',GOOD,
'Great Location Midtown, Trendy Spot Great place to stay in midtown Manhattan. Excellent rooms, friendly staff, spacious room compared to other places. Trendy and modern atmosphere, fashion magazines in lobby, etc.I would definitely stay there in the future. Restaurant Koi is great, and Cellar Lounge is hip for dancing/late night drinks. ',GOOD,
'Perfection in the Park! The Bryant Park Hotel is an oasis inside the city. Located next to beautiful Bryant Park in Midtown, you get a great location, the amenities of a premium brand hotel and the comfort and ambiance of a boutique hotel. I am very picky when it comes to hotels and this one gets gets top marks across the board. The staff is friendly, courteous and on the ball. The rooms (I stayed in a Junior King Suite) are beautifully appointed, extremely spacious and packed with great Molton  Brown amenities, gorgeous towels and great bathroom fixtures. The wood floors are a welcome relief from the typical dusty carpets that you get in most hotels. The room is very quiet; I never heard another person on either side, top, bottom, or in the hallway. The room was designed with the minimilist approach (meaning you won't find heavy, ornate furniture), which compliments the overall aesthetics perfectly. NYC hotels can be tricky and sometimes even some of the best known ones are disappointing. The Bryant Park Hotel is the perfect anecdote for anyone who is tired of big, convention-style hotels and leery of smaller unknown boutique hotels. I would highly recommend it and plan to stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Excellent Boutique Hotel Hotel was Hip and trendy without being over the top. Excellent friendly staff. Room was lovely and cool and clean with really nice bathroom! Great bar and restaurant. Beautiful park opposite the hotel which is great fro coffee and a danish in the morning. Central to most things-you can walk to 5th Ave, Rockafella, broadway, times Square and Grand Central Stn. Definitly will be staying there again. ',GOOD,
'Best hotel in New York! I LOVE THE BRYANT PARK! My husband and I stayed at the hotel the weekend of our wedding, and it was perfect. The location - right off Bryant Park with a view of the park, the library, and the beautiful skyline - is fantastic and extremely convenient, the staff is wonderful and helpful, and the rooms are spectacular (including the bathrooms with skyline views) - if you are lucky you will book one with a terrace over the park. Thank you to the Bryant Park for making our wedding weekend wonderful! ',GOOD,
'Bryant Park Hotel 鈥?Great Location. Great New York Value! I stayed at the Bryant Park in mid July 2007 for two days for a business trip to NYC. Enjoyed to hotel very much; probably similar to others in reviews. I鈥檒l give a few comments.LocationYour two blocks from Times Square and 陆 block from the subway. Could not be more convenient. The park has been transformed from a very seedy place in the 80鈥檚 to a terrific amenity. Unfortunately, I was swayed by a few reviews and requested a room not facing the park. A big mistake, as would have been terrific view overlooking park. Also, Monday nights during summer show movies in park. Monday I was at hotel had 鈥淭o Sir with Love鈥?with Sidney Pointier. Was a terrific scene.RoomMy room was nice and well detailed. Not sure if was standard, but for $295/night rate at that location was very pleased. Enjoyed sound machine in room, as whatever noise there was totally blocked out. Slept very well.Staff  AmenitiesContrary to other reviews, I found the staff very friendly. No attitude at all. Gave directions when needed and service on demand. Liked very much fitness center on floor five without a charge. Very not New York. All other amenities terrific.SummaryAll in all enjoyed the hotel very much. Felt was terrific value and would definitely stay there again. Hotel would work well for business trip or weekend New York experience. ',GOOD,
'Almost perfect I loved this hotel. The room was clean and contemporary with a great view of Bryant Park. The bathroom was gorgeous. Perfect location. I found the staff to be friendly with the exception of some of the people that worked in the Cellar Bar. It's not that they were rude, just not really friendly either. When the bar started getting crowded around 11:30 - they literally came over and took our barstools out from under us. I was a little put off by this. I realize they probably wanted to clear the bar area, but then why have the stools there in the first place? We had been sitting there for nearly 2 hours. The only other complaint I have was the noise. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the park and around 4:30 am the noise was unbearable. I'm not even sure what it was since I didn't get up to look, but it was the sound of bottles breaking and trash trucks I believe. It seemed as if we had our windows open even though we did not. If you're used to living in a city, maybe this would be ok for you, but I did not get a good night sleep at all.If it weren't for the noise and the bar stool thing - I would give this hotel an excellent rating. I would probably stay there again, but ask for a room not facing the street this time. It was well worth the money. ',GOOD,
'Cool, clean and close. Stayed there during Independence week with my teenage daughter, and we both loved it. The staff was always smiling and we were treated like celebrities - a few extra tips can get you a long way.When we checked in, the bell boy gave us a tour in our room - the iPod dock, the stereo, the safe, the sound machine, the do-not-disturb-light etc., and there was a box of chocolate and a card from the hotel manager. When we left the room each morning, the maiden would clean the room - and we would come back in the afternoon with all the shopping bags and to rest before going out again - when we came back later in the evening, she had made the beds again and tidied the room once more. Now, that's service.Maybe it's because I'm Danish, but the wooden floors and minimalistic style made us feel at home. The room was very spacious and very clean - especially compared to other NYC hotels, we've stayed in. Is the elevator dark? Rather, but the teenager liked the red light and the disco music and was dancing every time we rode the elevator. Can you hear street noise? It's Midtown....but it wasn't much and we were on 7th floor on the view side,. Can you hear the Bryant Park showing outdoor movie monday nights? Sure, but just go see the movie with the locals. Is the lobby really so small, you can't sit anywhere or meet with friends? Why not use the trendy bar downstairs or the great park across the street instead.Oh, and there's a free newspaper outside your door every morning, and you should bring it, when you're having your breakfast in the park - you can buy fresh fruit, bagels, juice, coffee, omelet, pancakes etc. several places just next to the hotel (besides the breakfast in the hotel restaurant gets boring after a few days.....not to mension expensive).The only problem.....and this problem has occured in every hotel, I have ever stayed in......is the night hawks. Yes, my fellow travellers (you know who you are), when you come back to your room 3 o'clock in the night, it's not cool to bring the party to your room or to be noisy and to waken the rest of the floor. By the way, we never heard any noise from the night club or the cellar bar.Will I stay there again? I won't stay anywhere else! ',GOOD,
'AMAZING PLACE The Bryant Park Hotel is not only the best people watch place, but the atmosphere alone will have you coming back for more. It is elegant and truly fantastic. The staff were nice and terrifically helpful. I couldn't imagine coming to nyc and not staying at this hotel. Did I mention it is placed in the best location in the city? You will not be dissapointed with this hot spot. ',GOOD,
'Perfect, though a bit too trendy The Bryant Park Hotel has the ideal midtown Manhattan location, everyone is friendly and helpful, and the rooms are clean and modern. You can't go wrong when all of the important points are so well covered. Of course, you pay for it. We were there during the 4th of July week and we got what they call a junior suite for $359/night. It was only one big room so I'm not sure why they call it a suite, but it was a bright and clean room. The decor was trendy minimalist. Bare walls, Molton Brown toiletries, a Toto toilet, and a safe, but no coffeemaker. We didn't ask for one and they probably would have sent one up, but it's midtown and there's coffee everywhere. We discovered that if we took the complimentary newspaper with us, we could buy coffee and read the paper across the street in Bryant Park. Maybe it was good that we couldn't make coffee in the room, but it would have been nice to have the option.We never noticed any problem with people going to the bar downstairs, setup for the Friday morning concert (Norah Jones) in the park across the street wasn't silent, but it wasn't bad. We stayed 3 nights and even though security people were making sure that only guests could use the elevators, I'd think that they might have started to recognize us before we checked out. Of course it's very dark by (and in) the elevators, so maybe they just couldn't see us. Anyone who enjoyed the Rocpool Reserve in Inverness would be likely to like this hotel too.Would I go back? Yes, when the price is right. It's not for everyone and I'd actually like a warm and welcoming atmosphere better that the cold trendiness, but I don't think I've stayed anywhere in midtown that I liked better. ',GOOD,
'Hotel great shame about some of the staff Having read mostly good reviews on the site, we decided to overlook some reviews about the superior and unhelpful attitudes of some of the staff - we really wish we hadnt!The room was very comfortable with good facilities and a great bathroom and in a great location. Some of the staff were professional and helpful, but we felt badly let down by three things which happened.We chose the hotel as we understood from the web site that all rooms had bathtubs, and as I have a back problem this was important to us so that I could relax after walking around the city. When we arrived we were allocated a room without bath. When we asked we were changed to another room the next day, which we were pleased about, and were told by staff that they would move us whilst we went out. On our return, it was clear that staff on the next shift had not been informed about the move and as my partner didnt have his passport (although I did and the room was secured with my credit card) we were made to wait 10-15 minutes whilst security came so we could be escorted to our room. When we got up to our room and my partner looked for our passport the security man said it didn鈥檛 matter and left without seeing it! The woman on reception who dealt with us was curt and unhelpful. Incidentally, we overheard this same member of staff making uflattering comments about another guest which we felt to be completely unprofessional!On returning to the hotel on our last night we decided to visit the cellar bar at 10.30 pm. As we waited at the bar, the bar woman came up and said 鈥榮orry we are closed鈥? despite the fact that there were other people drinking in the bar. As we left we watched another couple come in and they were served. We complained to staff on the desk who explained that as there was a film in Bryant Park they were trying to stop people using the toilets. We felt this to be a very poor excuse as she only needed to ask to see our door keys . Clearly depsite being dressed up we weren't cool enough for this pretentious 'hotspot'!On checking out we were presented with a bill of $300 more than the price we had been given on our reservation. When we pointed this out, despite having a copy of the correct bill which we had signed when we arrived, the woman on the desk argued with us and denied that the bill was incorrect. She only changed the bill when she had reluctantly phoned reservations and had the correct price confirmed. This took her two more attempts as she was unsure of how to do this. We have complained to the hotel on our return to the UK . We were pleased that the manager took the trouble to call us and we have been offered an upgrade and a complimentary night's stay on a future visit - but there's no way we'd go back and wouldn't reccomend this hotel to anyone else. ',POOR,
'Nice stay, shame about the noise From the louder than average piped music in the reception, staff wearing trendy, designer-black uniforms, the Braynt Park has more of a nightclub feel about it than your usual hotel.No expense seems to have been spared fitting out the rooms, Bose sound system, iPod dock, plasma tv putting this way ahead of most hotels. Shame that a bit more money wasn't spent on a bit of sound proofing via the windows. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the summer attractions in the park opposite created a bit of a racket. I returned to my room at 10.30pm (on a Monday) to be greeted by a highly audible noise from the outdoor, free film screening outside. Fortunately, the film ended by 10.45pm and maybe the wooden floor in the room only served to heighten the echoes. However, the noise of sirens, garbage trucks and the like woke me up on several occasions before I gave up at 7am. Maybe that's why they provided earplugs in the room - pity I didn't find them untl I left!Room and bathroom were certainly big enough, with high ceilings to boot. Breakfast (not included) in the restaurant downstairs was certainly very good (not cheap, though nice when your firm's paying).Only 2 small elevators served my floor. These get a bit busy around peak time, andhad to let them go a couple of times as they were already full. Would have taken the stairs but for suitcase and bag.Overall the experience of this hotel was a good one - you couldn't fault the cleanliness or helpfulness of the staff. Don't think I would have justified the cost of staying here though if it wasn't the company paying. ',GOOD,
'Great room, beware Friday morning noise at the front       Junior Suite bed and TV ',GOOD,
'Modern, Clean, Awesome! First time stay at Bryant Park Hotel (06/07) was excellent! The lobby/check-in area is much smaller than other hotels at comparable prices, but it was more than sufficient. The red  brown decor is gorgeous  the front desk staff was extremely helpful  friendly! We had a superior room on the 10th floor that was modern  very clean, with a HUGE bathroom, large tub, comfy bed with awesome pillows  great robes!! For a quick, inexpensive meal, I recommend the very popular Cosmic Diner (8th  52nd), Good food, hearty portions, but noon rush on weekends felt somewhat Soup Nazi-ish. But hey, it's New York!

'Love the Bryant Park Hotel!!! The Bryant Park Hotel is a great place to stay in a location close to Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave. shops and overall midtown sites. I live in NJ but stay here whenever I feel like being in the city and enjoying the clubs and NY experience. When financially possible, stay in the Bryant Park suites which have a great view to Bryant Park and (some have 2 bathrooms) and all suites have flat screen tvs in both the bedroom and living room. I've stayed in rooms on the 20th, 21st, 14th and 16th floors. Keep in mind that ALL the rooms are unique and some even have terraces overlooking the city!The decor is quite modern, so if you're looking for a traditional hotel do NOT stay here. Models and fashion executives stay here during Fashion Week for easy access to the Bryant Park fashion shows. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is fantastic with separate shower and large bathtub if you wish to have a nice, hot bath after your long day in the city, The staff is great and can accomodate all needs and special requests. I love the bathrobes and I'm now hooked to the Molton Brown bathroom amenities which you can find at Saks Fifth Avenue or the Molton Brown store in midtown Manhattan.The minibar is well stacked with all your favorite spirits - albeit somewhat expensive. Bring your iPod to enjoy the iPod stereo system in the bedroom. Room service food is above any hotel standards and includes sushi rolls, chicken dishes and your basic american cuisine.This is a fantastic hotel, catering to those who desire modern decor and ambiance in a hot spot setting for a fabulous night in NY!! ',GOOD,
'The Bryant Park Hotel is excellent. Wow, this a great hotel! I paid $299 for a room that was large and perfectly furnished. Great bathroom as well (size and Molton Brown products!!). Unlike the W - which is the hotel I usually use - it was clean and kept up (the W in Times Square always has rooms that are so fithly and damaged by previous guests). The staff were super friendly and very competent. This will be my NYC hotel going forward. It's so much better, I'm willing to forego the SPG points! ',GOOD,
'Large rooms; fabulous location The Bryant Park Hotel was a terrific choice for my one-night trip to NYC. Why?1. Great location: Especially good if you're taking the train into town and traveling light, as I was. You can easily walk to the hotel from both Penn and Grand Central Station. It was also great to be right across the street from Bryant Park on a beautiful spring day -- the perfect place to take a break to read your book or have a cup of coffee.2. A very spacious and comfortable room with an enormous bathroom, with both tub and shower. I was in a Deluxe room on one of the mid-level floors, so lots of sunlight. The bed was extremely comfortable, and there was an iPod player.3. Security. You have to show your room key at all times to get to the guest elevators.What would I change?1. Room decor. The bare white walls had the feel of a dorm room, without even posters to add a little visual interest. The traditional tan/cream marble used in the bath didn't seem to match the rest of the decor.2. The complete lack of a lobby. I don't even remember any chairs in the reception area. I'm not quite sure where you would sit and wait for someone; maybe in the restaurant?With a one-night stay, I didn't have much of a chance to assess service, but I'm inclined to go back. ',GOOD,
'What a great hotel! My wife and I decided to spend a long weekend in NY over the Bank Holiday. Last time we stayed in the Algonquin which was nice but the room was tiny. Given that the jet lag is quite bad coming from the UK, we decided to spend a wee bit more so that we could have a nice big room to lounge about in. We paid about 拢270 a night for a Junior Suite which is prob the most we have ever spent on a hotel room. However, it really was money well spent; the room was massive, the bed very comfortable, there was the obligatory plasma on the wall but best of all was the terrace. A really good size affording great views over the park from the 19th floor.The hotel itself was very chic. We did not use the restaraunt but did try out the cellar bar which was definitely a good place for New Yorkers to go posing. The location of the hotel is pretty much ideal and the park itself is really spot on: attractive, green, compact and a welcome oasis in amongst all the sky scrapers dotted around mid town.Would defintitely recommend this hotel but we did have to spend quite a bit for the luxury. ',GOOD,
'What a great surprise!!! Just stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel for the first time -- no reason to ever try another hotel. Huge new bathroom, clean, quiet ,and, the best part of all, the most comfortable bed I've ever experienced (in a room under $400/night. Sheets were luxurious and pillows to die for. Great location -- across from the park and centrally located. Didn't have an opportunity to try the restaurant -- maybe next time. Not much interaction with the front desk but the doorman was great! Will definitely return! C ',GOOD,

'Great modern hotel Fantastically smart modern hotel, great location. Ideal for youngish couples etc, service is good and there when you need it. Probably not the hotel for everyone if you like ' traditional hotels ' , personally the room is the most important thing for us, and 10/10 for the room in the Bryant ( although we did get upgraded to a junior suite with a terrace) on the 19th floor. Huge bathroom, Egyptian cotton sheets, I Pod dock, great TV, room cleaned twice a day, ( WHAT MORE CAN YOU WANT!!) Didnt try the restaurant, but the cellar bar is very chic. Overall would recommend 100%. ',GOOD,

'Great Stay Great View Stayed 8 nights in March / April and had an enjoyable stay.Was in room 1605 in a deluxe with a view and what a view from the bed area and the massive bathroom.Found the bed OK but the room was excellent in amenities and style, which is minimalistic, which I like.There is a number of cheap options for breakfast close by and room service is very expensive although it's NYC.There is a dry cleaner who will do your' wash and fold on W39th St b/w 5th  6th Ave's for a reasonable price.All in all a very nice stay, in a great room with a great view. ',GOOD,
'excellent stay overall I was somewhat worried about the minimalist decor/coolness of this property, but it quickly won me over. Our Bryant suite was nicely appointed, if slightly stark. The bed was of excellent quality and the linnens were divine. The flatscreens in the LR and bedroom were perfect. The lighting/heating systems and controls were extremely fine and tremendously appreciated. I have never enjoyed a hotel bathroom so much...from the heavenly tub to the stereo system to the plush robes (which I normally don't use). All care has been taken to provide top quality modernity throught the hotel. My only beef was service. While the staff is quite friendly and natural, some kinks need to be worked out. We had made it clear that we had a special celebration during our stay. While we greatly appreciated being given a very good rate on a Bryant Suite, not even a congradulations card, much less flowers, wine or chocolate were in the suite. We quickly ordered Godiva chocolates and were brought the wrong kind. Only later that evening could we look forward to finally digging into the replacement. When we returned to the room we found a small box of quite boring flat chocolate squares...not exactly what we had in my mind. We laughed about the $30 or so we were paying for it and let it go. The remainder (most) of our continental breakfast was removed from the room despite a note I left on it to please leave it for us. A series of calls and miscommunications ensued (including a call to us at 7 a.m. the next morning) which I was not in the mood for, just to have those things replaced. That said I feel the staff truly wants to be top notch and with perseverance and committment to it, they will in time. ',GOOD,
'Recommended Stayed here for 6 nights while on holiday in April. Had an excellent room (#1705) - a deluxe queen with views of the park. We went through Expedia and paid around $300 but this was on a special deal. On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a junior suite for $100 extra per night which we declined. The staff were ultra-professional in every way.No problems with street noise and liked that we could open the windows. The candid traveler photos give an excellent idea of what the room is like - quite minimalist but clean, comfortable, good TV, iPod dock, Bose CD/radio. The bathroom is amazing - large, has 2 windows, massive bathtub and shower, Molton Brown toiletries - a definite selling point. Fresh linen  towels were provided each day, and a bucket of ice in the evening. Location is ideal for tourists - easy to walk to Times Sq, 5th Av, ESB etc and subway station on the same block. You can get a great breakfast at Pax wholesome foods (right next to subway) for less than $10. We went to the hotel's Cellar Bar on Friday evening, it was quite fun but very loud, expensive and full of young 20-somethings going crazy. Didn't check out the hotel restaurant, but always seemed busy.Recommendations for eating/drinking (ideal for both):'Cesca (relaxed Italian in the UWS, W 75th St, b/w Amsterdam  Columbus)Kittichai (trendy Thai in the Village, Thompson St, b/w Broome  Spring)Kemia (bohemian Moroccan in Hell's Kitchen, corner of 9th Ave  44th St )The Bar Room restaurant at MoMA was also excellent. ',GOOD,
'Disappointing I wish I had read ALL these reviews before booking.I can relate to all the negative points raised by the reviews below and a few more.Upon arrival the check-in desk could not find our reservation. We did not have our booking email with us. Instead of inviting us to access our email account from their computer they pointed us down the road to the nearest internet cafe. The reservation had been booked on my girlfriends CC but the hotel reservation was in my mine (no idea why).We arrived in our room at approximately 2 or 3pm. The room looked dark even with the curtains open because the view consisted of neighbouring buildings on two sides (Not a major point as we intended to spend very little time there but certainly nothing like the pictures).After heading out for the remainder of the day we arrived back on the Thursday night to a melee outside the door. A queue to get in to the 'cellar bar'. We were going back to our room so didn't appreciate being grabbed by the arm on the way in to verify we were residents.Checking out day was interesting too. Being honest people we were amazed to discover a room service bill of only $20 when we knew it was at least $60. We paid what we thought it was anyway.The plan was to leave our bags with the luggage staff (excellent by the way, the only redeeming feature of the place) and use the remaining ours for last minute shopping. When we arrived back at 4pm my girlfriend asked to use the bathroom. She was instructed to use the Cellar Bar. Two minutes later she is back at the desk as they were closed (for cleaning I presume). She was then sent up to the 5th floor gym. Again she was back in a couple of minutes as you need a key to access that floor and we had already checked out. The receptionist knew this as we had all our bags with us and were waiting for a cab.From our experience it seemed like the hotel was an after-thought. If they are serious in charging those room prices then they need to improve the standard of customer care at reception rather than employing staff who just look good. They should certainly have a different entrance to the cellar bar from the main hotel entrance. Whilst I don't expect to always get a great view it would at least be nice to know what views are available and decide at that point whether or not to proceed with the booking.All in all, a disappointing stay. NY was great though. ',POOR,
'Very Nice NYC Hotel I stayed for one night at the Bryant Park in April 2007. I had room 1705, which is a deluxe queen room with a park view. The rate I had was $400, which isn't a bargain, but I was traveling on business. The room was everything I could have wanted. It had three enormous windows with great views, modern decor (hardwood floors and minimalist design), a nice small table on which I could work, and a great bathroom. The bathroom had a very deep tub and a separate shower stall with a rain shower. It also had two big windows, which is a sort of different touch from most hotel room bathrooms. The service was polite and efficient. I have stayed in a number of NY hotels for work and pleasure, and I would definitely rate this among the very best I've stayed at. The hotel doesn't have a business center, if that matters to you -- but there is a Kinkos right nearby. The hotel charges for wireless internet access, which I dislike. The hotel restaurant Koi was a decent (if overly trendy and dark) sushi restaurant. The location isn't the greatest -- sort of a boring midtown area, but if you get a deal on this hotel, you should snap it up! ',GOOD,
'A Great Stay Just had a one night stay the The Bryant Park; it was the second visit to this hotel for my wife and myself. We have been going to NYC to get away for a few days for 20 years now. We loved the Paramount years ago when it was new and ffresh, and have tried all of the Ian Schrager hotels. We have found a new favorite in The Bryant Park. We were upgraded on arrival to a junior suite (we had booked a standard rom through the Tablet website) and it was a corner room on the 19th floor overlooking the park. Spacious, sufficently luxurious, and, best of all, with an ipod speaker system! About time that a hotel figured out that people bring their ipods, and that having a $100 system in the room that accepts ipods would be a good amenity to have.Excellent front desk people, excellent linens, a noise machine provided, the room had been de-feathered (wife allergic to down) as requested, and a great shower.Some minor negatives - the scones were sub-par, the toilet ran unless you jiggled the handle, there was only one bar of soap, and the battery in the tv remote (a large plasma screen, btw) needed replacing. ',GOOD,
'Perfect stay I did a ton of research before making my decision on where to stay. I think I read every NYC trip review on this site. My husband and I spent the weekend in a Junior Suite. We reserved a deluxe queen, but they upgraded us without our even asking. We stayed in room 1606, which is a smoking room. I would advise anyone who really doesn't like the smell of smoke to not chance a smoking room because the smell was quite strong. However, my husband smokes, so it was nice for him to be able to do so in the room, unlike in many other NYC hotels which have gone smoke free.Valet and check in was smooth. The doorman even suggested that we try to park on the street to save money, which I thought was a kind gesture, but we opted for Valet anyway. The Lobby: Very small, not grandiose, but sleek, and to the point. Front desk staff was kind and helpful (not to mention quite attractive!). We were checked in and to the room in five minutes. The room: Gorgeous! Beautiful hardwood floors, king bed, revolving LCD screen could be seen from the bed, the chaise, and the bathtub, which I loved. The lighting in the room was nice and low. They left a full box of chocolates and a personalized welcome note from the manager at bedside. The room had four huge windows overlooking Bryant Park and the library. It looked exactly like the junior suite picture on the website. The only complaint I have is that there were no international channels. My husband speaks Spanish, and there wasn't even Univision or Telemundo. I found that kind of odd in NYC hotel, but maybe that's standard. We ended up ordering Spanish speaking movies through the On Demand system and were fine, but it would have been nice to have a Spanish channel or two. Minor quip, I know. The bathroom - loved it! It was huge! Separate shower and soaking tub. Large, thick towels and bathrobes, and as I mentioned above, I loved that you could sit in the tub and watch a movie at the same time.I ordered room service for breakfast each morning, and was surprised at how expansive the continental breakfast was. For $20 (plus tax, delivery, tip, etc) you are given three gigantic pastries, a small carafe of coffee, fresh squeezed juice of your choice, and a large plate of fresh fruit (raspberries, blackberries, oranges, strawberries, pineapple, melon, kiwi, green grapes!). It was the best continental breakfast I've ever had in a hotel and easily enough for two people. The croissants were amazing, and the fruit was fresh and sweet. The location is great. You are close enough to Times Square to walk there in five minutes, but you don't have to deal with the constant stream of people like you would at a hotel in the middle of it. It's a short walk to the Empire State Building, and to the shops on 5th Avenue.We loved the hotel and would definitely recommend it to others. For comparison, we paid $339 a night. It would have been the same at the Westin or the Hilton, if not more, and I am sure we would have enjoyed our stay much less. ',GOOD,
'very comfortable stay My boyfriend  I stayed 3 nights in a Deluxe Queen room on 12th floor. Unfortunately although we paid for a higher type room, we got a view from the back and into other office buildings, so didn't get a great view.The bedroom was a good size and cleanliness. Comfortable bed with the plasma screen TV, Bose iPod docking station and Bose radio. The bathroom was a good size too with the added Molton Brown toiletries. The decor was modern, light and airy. We ate at Koi and had a fabulous meal on the Saturday evening; they were kind enough to accommodate us as we understand that the restaurant gets booked out at the weekend especially. We also tried The Cellar bar as they had 2 complimentary cocktails thrown in from the hotel. All of the staff we encountered were polite and extremely helpful. We arrived on the Thursday before the blizzard snow fall on Friday! So the hotel is in a great location to go sight seeing. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a modern, stylish but comfortable base in Midtown Manhattan. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic room! We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. We had booked a junior suite but received a complimentary up-grade to a Bryant Park suite on the 18th floor at check-in. I don't know what the difference is, but we were delighted with the suite. The lounge area was huge and included a dining table and plasma screen TV, as well as 2 sofas and 2 chairs. It was a corner suite with fantastic views overlooking Bryant Park and the Library.The bedroom was a good size, and featured a large king-size bed, plasma screen TV, Bose iPod docking station and Bose radio. The bathroom was the largest I have ever seen in a hotel and I loved the Molton Brown toiletries.The decor was modern, light and airy. If you like this kind of decor at home, you will love it!The only quibble I have about the suite is that the wardrobe was in the lounge area, not in the bedroom.We didn't eat or drink in the hotel. The Cellar bar looked a bit too pretentious for our tastes to be honest.All of the staff we encountered were polite and extremely helpful. The doormen were especially helpful in securing taxis for us in the snow!Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a modern, stylish but comfortable base in Midtown Manhattan.

'The best boutique hotel in New York The coolest hotel I've stayed in, bar none - perfect for couples, clubbers and young urbanites. A beautiful Manhattan skyscraper dating from the 1920s with a plaque listing why it's of architectural and historial interest. The lobby: all red leather and black glass, very sexy. The lifts: dim, red light, house music playing softly. The room: modern, sexy, minimal: 'Journeys by DJ' CDs, a Bose CD player, an iPod dock, huge flatscreen, comfy queen-size bed, corner sofa, a beautiful marble bathroom. The extras: Molton Brown toiletries, a fabulously-stocked minibar, even sex toys! What's more, a specially-devised 'late night munchies' menu for those times when it's 4am, you've just got in, and you absolutely must have something to nibble on. The 'entertainment planning desk' couldn't have been more helpful, planning two nights out for us (and our requests were pretty specific, down to the type of crowd and sub-genre of house music we wanted). The cellar bar is so cool it even had New Yorkers queuing round the block on the Saturday night were were there - in the pouring rain (and New Yorkers NEVER wait in line). The service could not have been better and the only downside - if you could call it a downside - was that most of the shops, bars and clubs we wanted to go to were downtown, so we took a lot of cabs - but with someone to hail them for you, it was hardly much of a hardship. We'll definitely be going back - in fact, I can hardly wait. ',GOOD,
'Beautiful View at Bryant Park Hotel We stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel one night in March and paid an online rate of $289 ($334, including taxes). Our deluxe queen with a park view reservation was complimentarily upgraded to a suite with a park view on the 10th floor. The view was great -- all of Bryant Park and the NYC Public Library on one side, highrises on the other. The doormen, bellstaff, and front desk were all friendly, professional, and very courteous. The clientele all appeared to be stylish -- we noticed people of varying ages, including mother/daughter tourists and businessmen who seemed to be in creative sectors. There was a large club crowd the Saturday night we stayed (for their basement bar The Cellar)-- and the noise level, with some wee hour honking, was noticeable, even on a high floor. This hotel is not recommended for someone sensitive to street noise. The room was lovely. We had difficulty finding a hotel without the ornate, baroque, overdecorated, Gilded Age that seems to be the signature style for most luxury New York City hotels. We also didn't want the Middle American bland, standardized Hyatt/Marriott/Hilton style. Some of the downtown hip hotels seemed to try too hard to be stylish and that can be taxing. Bryant Park Hotel has a very relaxed, clean, contemporary style -- with hardwood floors, beautiful lighting, very comfortable beds, travertine marble bath, with a deep soaking tub and separate shower. Some of the hardwood flooring was warped in places, but it was not that noticeable. They had a selection of relaxing music, an honor bar refrigerator stocked with drinks and snacks. Not inexpensive but not outrageously priced either. Great for the convenience. 24-hour room service that we didn't try because we wanted to dine out, but the menu was nice and reasonably priced. Highly recommend this hotel for its target market share -- people who love clean, simple, contemporary styling in a midtown setting. We enjoyed every minute there, even the slightly noisy night as we like urban soundscapes. ',GOOD,
'Good Value, Great Location My wife and I stayed at the Bryant Park hotel for only one Saturday night, but we were very satisfied with the experience. We booked through [----] as a package deal that included theater tickets. We booked the standard room, but were upgraded to the next size room for free at check-in. The lobby staff was very nice and not pretentious at all. The room was on the 12th floor, and very clean, with a nice large bath that included a separate tub and shower. Two very comfortable terry cloth robs are located in each bath. The room decor is very modern, with a flat screen TV with high def channels, a Bose Wave radio, and even a seperate speaker system that you can connect you iPod or other MP3 player to. Other interesting room items were found in the wet bar area of the closet. Not only can you purchase the usual drinks and snacks, but they also sell a Pleasure Kit for amorous couples. I'll leave the kit contents to your imagination. We had no problems with street noise in our room, but if you are a light sleeper, they even include two sets of ear plugs in the bath.You can tell the building is an older building, with the narrow halls, and small elevators, but this is typical of older NYC hotels that have been renovated. The indoor renovations at the Bryant Park are nicely done, and the outside is also very unique, with gold trim around the edges and roof lines. There is a nightclub in the basement that apparently is very popular, as there was a line waiting to get in when we returned from the theater.Besides the nice rooms and friendly staff, the other part we really liked about the hotel is the location. It is right across the street from Bryant Park, a very nice little city park with tall trees, sitting benches, a small carousel for kids, and even free WiFi internet access. On one side of the park is the back of the New York Public library and what looks like a nice cafe. The hotel is centrally located in the fashion district, with plenty of clothing stores in the surrounding blocks. You are also only one block from Park Avenue and all the shopping that area provides, and about 5 blocks from Times Square and the theater district. There are plenty of good restaurants withing walking distance of the hotel, including the Pax cafe, on the corner just down from the hotel entrance. We had a good, reasonably priced breakfast there on Sunday morning.Overall, our nicest NYC hotel experience to date, and we would definitely stay there again. ',GOOD,
'great place to stay! I visit NY twice a year for business meetings - and have stayed at a number of different NYC hotels - bryant park has been the best by far!When I checked in - and handed over my confirmation slip; I found to my dismay that my office had booked me in for november 20th instead of october 20th ( the date i checked in!!) . After a 18 hr flight from asia - i just wanted to cry! The front desk staff were EXTREMELY polite and helpful - and since no rooms were avlbl at that time called around to several hotels, got me a room for the night at the park hotel; and then got me into a cab and promised to have a room ready for me the next day.The next day when i turned up - I had credit card issues - and again the front desk staff came to my rescue - agreed to book the room for me for the required 5 days by blocking my credit card one day at a time.The front desk staff and bellman were extremely friendly and remembered me by name throuGhout the length of my stay.My room on the 4th floor was great - and since I dont like extreme quiet - I was quite happy with the street noises. Bed was brilliant - large and had the nicest feather pillows. Bathroom was the biggest Ive ever seen in NY. ',GOOD,
'Great location, avoid 4th floor We stayed here for 5 nights from the 19th February 07. We had specifically asked not to be on the 4th floor due to other reviews but, when we arrived, that was the only room availalbe. We were tired so decided to go with it - big mistake. The NY fashion show in the square was being demolished during the night and the noise unbearable - we had to put the fake bird noise machine on to attempt to drown out the outside racket. We moved to a room on the 8th floor the next night which, although was much smaller for the same price, was lovely and relatively quiet! Although the room service was expensive the food was excellent, the service was hit and miss though. They lost one breakfast order totally.Overall, I would say that the location is excellent, the staff were all extremely helpful, the bar good fun and the koi restaurant superb, pricy food so great for a treat. I would stay again but insist on a room on the 8th floor or above. ',GOOD,
'Nice but not a fantastic hotel (def not luxury) Stayed at the BPH for 5 days.I had book a qeluxe queen with view and got upgraded for free to a junior suite. I m glad i was upgraded because the size of their jr suite is average, so i wonder how small was the room i booked.service is fine. room service is incredbly expensive. mini bar as well (9$ for a beer)the wooden floor was cracked and some pieces of wood where moving out so you could hurt yourself very bad if walking barefoot.the bathroom is really great. Big, Bright. Clean.The bath is huge and the walk'in shower in huge and great too !the molton brown amenities are nice but not that incredible.location is great. 2 steps from Times Square yet sufficenlty away toto avoid the crowd.there was some work ongoing at the park in front (they were surely fixing everything after the fashion week) so it was noisy at night (I was at the 15th floor).the sound machine is irritating. each time the maid cleans she turns on the little birds noise which is terribe.there is absolutely no space to meet or to hang out at the hotel.the bar is cool yet the crowd is very young( 15-22 yo).overall, nice experince, but I won't go back. NY has much more to offer, especially in this price range ',GOOD,
'wonderful, location is good, and the service and room are marvellous My husband and I going to New York twice o three times per year to New York. After to have tried several hotels we found Bryant Park perfect, for location, confortable rooms and kind service. I love the modern hotel, with wood floors, I think they are cleaner. If you can get a room with a balcony is perfect, because you can see the Bryant Park view, and you can enjoy the sigth of the city. You have too a japanais restaurant and celllar bar where you can fun ................It's perfect ',GOOD,
'Avoid fourth floor rooms I booked a suprior king room with a view - and was given a room on the fourth floor overlooking the park. Indeed, these rooms are very noisy (and draughty) given the windows are very old with lots of gaps. Like the previous reviewer who stayed on this floor - the noise from the street is unacceptable.My only issue was I had to ask six times to be changed to another room. The receptionist claimed that it was not possible since there were no rooms of a similar standard available - more curiously - they were unable to give me a superior room without a view as it was considered to be a down grade and they were unsure how to process such a change. Eventually, they worked out how to move me and I was given a superior room at the back of the hotel.My new room was great - the bathrooms are really luxurious with the largest bath I've had in a new york hotel.The staff are friendly and the location is great. A minor downside is that there is no where to chill out - apart from your bedroom. The bar is really noisy and the restaurant is fairly hectic (food was pretty good). ',GOOD,
'free upgrade! booked a one night stay btwn xmas and nye w/ my girlfriend in a queen view room and upon checking in, was upgraded to the penthouse for free. very friendly staff, room decor was so-so, annoying external lights right outside of several windows (although this didn't detract from the view of the empire state building), amenities A+, although charging $8 for a shaving kit is ridiculous, very pricy but hey, it's new york. will definitely return.

'Just Okay... Date: December 21, 2006Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, NebraskaWe reserved a Superior room at The Bryant Park Hotel to get a room with a view. The room had a nice view of Bryant Park, with the ice skating rink and small shops. However, our room was located on the fourth floor and appears to be the only floor without newer windows. I am a sound sleeper, but the noise level was unacceptable. We could hear normal conversations from street level. Floor four is the first floor of rooms available. I highly recommend avoiding this floor.The beds were comfortable and the room furniture was very nice. We really liked the wood floors. Also, the bathroom was quite roomy. However, the rainhead shower had very little pressure and the shower wand barely trickled water out the spout. The flat-screen TV had a great picture but it was fixed on the wall perpendicular to the bed. You couldn't use the remote from the bed and the view from bed was a true neck-bender! We moved the bed so we could change channels to watch TV. Fortunately little time was spent in the room.We never got the opportunity to see the bar. It was closed on Sunday evening, and had a private function on Monday evening. The staff was quite nice. Checkin and checkout went without a hitch. I did share my opinions with the front staff and the gal commented all the rooms are as noisy as the rooms on the fourth floor. Other reviews don't seem to share this sentiment.In summary, this is a nice, clean hotel with a great location in NYC. Bryant Park is a real gem. However, our room did not meet four-star criteria. ',POOR,
'Hotel Hell!! BEWARE of this hotel if you want genuine friendly service. Great location, but don't expect anything but an absolutely terrible experience if you are in need of assistance. They refused to give me my coat back because of a lost coat check ticket and the security stepped in when I put up a fuss about it. It was the middle of winter. Instead of being helpful they were painfully uncaring and brutal. My expereince here was an absolute NIGHTMARE!! ',POOR,

'Great Location The Bryant Park is in a really nice area near Times Square and 5th Avenue. The lobby is small but stylish - pretty basic tho. Rooms are nicely designed (modern and airy) but comfortable and good size for price. The bathrooms are very nice - showers amazing. Overall recommended. ',GOOD,
'everything we expected ..... booked principally on the basis of previous reviewers comments for a 4 night birthday treat stay and we were not disappointed in the least!.room was spacious enough for New York and the large flat screen TV meant little need for other more normal hotel picture decorations on the walls!. bathroom was HUGE and shower was great the room was up on the 11th floor and whilst not directly facing the park this was probably a good thing given the skating/xmas stall event going on whilst we were there!staff were fantastic - nothing too much for them only slight criticisms were : room internet not working (not the hotels direct fault) and the ridiculous price of the room mini bar!! (definitely a hotel fault).yes there is nowhere to really meet people but then plenty of bars within short distanceyes the doorman was not always present but there more often than not and always pleasant and willing to do anything for you.best bit though - the fantastic location - without the noise or disruption of Times Square.worst bit - realising the downstairs bar closed on a Sunday when that was your last day to use complimentary cocktails vouchers!.great deli a few doors down (made up for the mini bar pricing) and a more than reasonable up market grill room in the Park across the road.overall very happy with choice of hotel - way better than the Royalton or the Shoreham that we have stayed at previously - in short perfect break - even the weather was great! - already recommending to others looking for a good value, well located little bit different type of NY hotel. ',GOOD,
'What a great spot! We spent a great long weekend in NYC staying at the Bryant Park. It has a great location, easy to get both up town and down town either via the numerous cabs or the subway. The park across the street had free ice skating and a Christmas fair the weekend we were there.The rooms were very chic, minimal and comforatble. The bathroom was a great size for NY city rooms - great shower too. The staff were always helpful and responsiveOnly small complaint was that the bar didn't open until 8pm on Saturday, too late for pre-dinner drinks, and didn't open at all on Sunday evening. Not a big problem thought as there were plenty of other paces to go. We'll definitely go back again. ',GOOD,
'Cool hotel, great location Just got back from a week's stay at the Bryant Park Hotel with my fiancee. It is a really cool hotel, very trendy. We went for a superior room (I think- it was the next one up from a basic). The room was large and minimalistic, but with a large, comfy bed, plasma TV and huge bathroom, with Molton Brown accessories. My only gripe about the room was that there was no view- we faced the back of another building. It was also only on the 5th floor. I felt for the money spent we could have at least had something to look at! Immediately outside of the hotel is Bryant Park, a really peaceful little area. On the day we arrived, an ice skating rink opened for the Christmas period, which was amazing, the atmosphere was very chilled and jovial.The location of the hotel is just off 5th Avenue and Broadway, and Times Square is only a couple of minutes walk away. In fact, it was so well positioned that we never got a train anywhere and tried to walk.The restaurant, Koi, is a sushi restaurant in the evenings and very pretentious. We had our least enjoyable night there, yet our most expensive.The Cellar Bar is the bar at the bottom of the hotel, and again was really trendy. We had a great (heavy!) night there. Bit disappointed when we were told to not sit on the sofas after 11.00 unless we bought a bottle of vodka! I think this is typical in the USA though, so no hard feelings.All in all it was an amazing stay- the staff were always helpful and polite, and got to recognise us after a few days which made it even nicer. I would stay again, as long as I get a room with a view! ',GOOD,
'Cool Hotel! I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Bryant Park Hotel.This is a very trendy place to stay and the size of the rooms were certainly well above average for New York. The bathrooms were HUGE and the bath was like a swimming pool!The bedrooms were very well equiped with plasma TV and Bose stereo system.Our room overlooked Bryant Park and was a little noisy on the Saturday evening (why do the cab drivers have to beep their horns all the time?)!! Our friends rooms were on the back of the Hotel and were much quieter, however earplugs were available in each room.Disappointed that there were no recreational areas in the lobby for us to meet up with our friends, in fact the lobby is rather small.We chose not to eat in the Koi Restaurant as there is such a selection of eateries within easy walking distance.We did have a round of drinks in the Cellar Bar but they were extremely expensive so did not pay it a visit again!All in all our stay at the Bryant was most enjoyable and it's location is superb whehter you want to visit New York to shop or to sightsee.

'Absolutely Perfect! Recomendable 100% We spent 5 nights in this great hotel. We booked in advanced and we got a Junior Suite with Terrace. I strongly recommend this hotel, it is not cheap but it is very balanced quality-price.We loved it. The service very good and also it was a very private stay.Great area and quiet at night.I would go again for sure. ',GOOD,
'Super modern, great staff This is the most modern-style hotel I've ever seen. The staff was great, even let us check in early, but the hotel itself just wasn't really our style. Very art deco and cold, but clean. When I needed an ironing board, it took the staff about 2 minutes to bring me one, which was great. The bar downstairs was beautiful, but seemed to have that young club-hopping crowd. Great view of the park across the street, and super close to all the great sites in mid-town. It wasn't especially romantic and I did not see one guest over the age of 45 there. But its great, if that's what you like. ',GOOD,
'absolutely faultless We stayed at the bryant park for four nights in sept and absolutely loved it. The location is absolutely perfect, just a few blocks from times square yet set around a tranquil park, a really peaceful haven in the hustle and bustle of this city. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was a lovely bonus and the staff couldnt do more to help us. We ate in the restaurant where the food was great and the service good and we drank and danced in the cellar bar which was great although the cocktails were very pricey.Adrienne, the concierge sorted a few nights out for us and got us on the gust list to some of the hottest night clubs which was a great service in a city you dont know.Overall, I cant reccommend this hotel enough, we certainly werent disappointed.

'Could not have been happier! Stayed three nights in a large suite with a lovely terrace. I love the Bryant Park area and the view of the park from our terrace was spectacular. Also hosted a small gathering of friends in the room. The catering staff was superb, from set-up to clean-up. They provided a delicious assortment of hors d'ouevres, beautifully presented. Yes, it was expensive, but worth it. I found the staff friendly and helpful at every turn. I loved the minimalist, modern decor, although I realize that is not for everyone. Shower was heavenly!

'Enjoyable and convenient I stayed 3 nights with my fiance over labor day weekend. We had a junior suite, room 1406, for $339 per night. That seems to be a pretty good rate for this hotel and has maybe colored my impressions of value (which is very favorable)Overall, I really enjoyed my stay.Most of the reviews I've seen capture the essence of the place, so I'll focus on things I haven't seen mentioned.The room was larger than expected with huge windows that actually opened to a limited extent - the lower pane slid up about 5 inches (presumably limited so children can't squeeze through). You don't often see this feature on the 14th floor, and it's nice to let the air in sometimes.The floor in our room was wood (actually pergo) which was a really nice change from hotel carpeting and I think added a lot to the airy, comfortable feel of the room.This was the week before fashion week, so they were building the tents across the street in Bryant Park. Even though they worked through the night, the noise was tolerable and no worse than many midtown hotels. I can imagine this might be a really quiet hotel for a street-facing room in midtown if you don't come immediately before or during fashion week.This was a smoking room. When we arrived, it was a little smoky so I called the desk. Housekeeping arrived within 3 minutes with some air freshener and told us they would put an ionic cleaner in the room while we went to lunch - when we returned it was very fresh smelling without a trace of cigarette smoke. The hotel has a very strict policy about smoking in non-smoking rooms with a $500 penalty for doing so, which I was told about on check in (although it didn't apply to this smoking room). I chose the smoking room because we had arrived early (at noon) and it was all that was available unless we wanted to wait until regular check in time. It was also on a high floor - the clerk told me that floors 6 - 12 are non-smoking and 14-16 are smoking.Didn't try the restaurant as we had other plans each night. Location is fantastic.Best surprises: the really friendly, laid back staff; the size and airiness of the junior suite room (at least large and airy by Manhattan standards)Most disappointing: the mystery of the sometime there, sometimes not doorman; the small size and lack of public space in the lobby. ',GOOD,
'We loved Bryant Park We stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel for 4 nights for our honeymoon, and we had a great time. We stayed in a Junior suite on the 20th floor that had a huge balcony overlooking the park; the room was nicely decorated (minimalist but appealing), the bath was huge and the chocolate covered fortune cookies were a nice treat after hours on the plane. I can't remember the room number (2004?), but if you can make sure you get a room with a front-facing view of the park, rather than a corner suite that only has a small balcony space. The staff were courteous and helpful. The Cellar bar was good; the drinks were expensive, but complimentary cocktail vouchers made my Cosmopolitan very appealing. We didn't order room service, because the prices were outrageous, so every morning we went across to the park and bought coffee (and soup) from the food kiosks. We spent hours and hours choosing a hotel and hoping that we had chosen well, and we weren't disappointed. All in all staying at the Bryant only enhanced the memorable time we had in New York. ',GOOD,
'Very fine I just spent a weekend at the Bryant Park with my girlfriend and I thought it was quite good.First, we booked one of the package rooms that included American breakfast, a slightly larger room with a view and a late check-out. I would say that the room was not particularly large, but did have three large windows at the corner of the building and two more in a very spacious and well appointed bathroom. It was every bit as a large as many a Manhattan studio apartment. This package rate was $340 + tax. For the $450 room someone below had, I would expect they would be in a suite. And the standard room was around $250.Second, I found the decor to be nice, standard American modern. Hardly chilly, but then not BB comfy. Some of the furnishings were Ikea-esque, though not substandard. And as the previous poster said, yes there was no art on the walls, but we had huge windows overlooking Midtown Manhattan on two walls and a large plasma TV on another. That seems a strange complaint.The plusses: the location was ideal, the staff was helpful and professional, the bathroom was incomparable, the lobby and building architecture were great.The minuses: the only eating option in the hotel in the morning was breakfast in the room. If you didn't want to pay that expense, you were sort of out of luck in the hotel itself, though Midtown Manhattan isn't exactly without the food options of, say, smalltown Arizona. That being said, the room service b'fast was timely and quite large. The aforementioned $80 breakfast was priced at $26, though probably gets to $80 with tip and tax for two, which included two eggs, bread in any form you like, tasty potato croquettes, juice, coffee, a mimosa and water. Hardly being ripped off for $26. This is room service in New York -- I've paid that much for a cinnamon roll and coffee elsewhere.Being local, we did not use their concierge services for anything so I cannot comment on it. I think the hotel has a cool feel and like it might be trying a bit too hard. As a consequence, I think it's being judged a little too harshly. If it were understated and cute, I think the same result would be given a bit more lenience by reviewers. ',GOOD,

'Not for the hungry... We recently stayed at the Park Bryant Hotel, NYC. While the staff was beyond courteous, the decor and ambiance left a lot to be desired. For two weary shoppers, a day in NYC battling the street crowds and emptying our wallets - we thought the $450.00 a night rate would pamper our senses and revive our souls. Au contrar...The entrance and lobby was done in red naugahide and black. Cold lines and uninviting boldness sequed into another odd choice of decorating...a red light was all that guided us through the elevator to our room whereinit consisted of platform beds and stark walls - no art. The bed was adorned with naughahide bolster pillows in purple.The accents brown. While I am not a huge fan of modern, This decor could of easily been purchased from Target. It reminded me of a dorm room before students moved in. The bathroom touted state of the art spa amenities - if you wanted to purchase them. A sewing kit and tampons(2) could be purchased for $6 each. Amazing after a room charge so high, everything was ala carte. We were pleasantly surprised with a faux chinese box of chocolate covered fortune cookies...nice touch.The room service was staffed excellently, but again the food stunk. I would never again pay $80.00 for eggs, toast and a lump of potato, served with freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee. My companion ordered a waffle (soggy) adorned with fresh berries. Yes, folks, all this for $80.00 ! and then a midnight snack awarded us with a pitiful pizza - I would not recommend that.The adjoining japanese restaurant Kio is excellent, as is the Cellar bar where we had a delicious The Long Goodnight Kiss drink - I do say try it, you will be pleased.  All in all, the hotel did not live up to its price.. even though it's NYC and in a great location, it fails miserably at it's attempt at being hip. ',POOR,
'Is it a Hotel? Is it a Nightclub? Bryant Park is a fabulously located niche hotel a stones throw from the Empire State Building and Times Square. Without doubt NY is a cool city, and this hotel makes a 110% effort to be ice cold. We read all of the reviews on Tripadvisor before booking here, and the question of just what this establishment wants to be is a constantly recurring theme. Thing is, we wanted to stay somewhere with a bit of life and probably booked not only on the strength of the hotel, but also the fact that the Cellar Bar is supposed to be one of New York's finest.The reality is that if anything we felt slightly let down by the whole experience.We paid extra for one of the Bryant Park Suites which allegedly have views across Bryant Park. Room 1804 does, but only from the side and if you crane your neck, so we felt a touch swizzed with the very average New York view (side of another building and Bank of America construction site) from the start. The suites are allegedly 650 sq ft (which I would question) and are very neutrally and minimalistic in their decor. They are pleasant, but we have stayed in some of the world's best boutique hotels and this just felt a bit IKEA-ey and could have done with a lick of paint. Facilities in the room were adequate, but for $500 a night we would have expected two sinks and not to have to pay extra from the mini bar for sewing kits, shaving kits etc.The restaurant Koi is superb. We had dinner there on the Saturday night and found the food amazing and the service attentive.We then proceeded to spend the rest of the evening in the Cellar Bar. We arrived around 1030 and sat ourselves down at an unreserved table. After half an hour we were told that the table was now reserved and that we would have to move! The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask us to move themselves - they sent the girl who was supposed to have the table over instead! We sought out the manager who informed us that our stay in the hotel meant nothing, and that after 11pm it becomes a nightclub and that's the way it is. When we spend over $2000 to stay in a hotel we do not expect to be told we are second class citizens.Generally we found the staff to helpful if a little preoccupied/distracted. For example, two days into a five day stay our room inexplicably locked us out - the receptionist insisted on picture ID before unlocking it for us, and was at first not going to accept that our passports were locked - errrrr - in our room! This being despite the fact that she personally had checked us in not 48 hours earlier!So to all those entering the nightclub.v.hotel debate I would argue strongly that the Bryant Park is a nightclub with rooms bolted on. It is cool, the building is fabulous, the location is execellent and the idea is right. A-list it is not, and there are far better places to stay in New York which do not have delusions of grandeur. ',POOR,
'Fantastic location Having stayed at this hotel last year and much enjoyed it I was keen to use it again on a revisit to the area. The location is really great, easy walking distance to most areas, nice safe place didn't seem to be any problems. The hotel itself is pretty swish with red lacquered walls in the reception area and soft lighting everywhere. It looks more like a nightclub than a hotel really. Which in effect seems to be what it is changing into - where last year there was a great bar to the front open all day this is now a restaurant (Koi - very nice but more for a business lunch than something casual) with no bar AT ALL in the hotel even for guests before 5pm. The Cellar Bar remains but likewise does not open before 5pm. Seems to be more inviting to outside visitors really than actual hotel guests. Still...the rooms are not a bad size, always very well cleaned with a selection of Molton Brown goodies and a great big tub to chill out in. Also a flat screen TV, DVD etc. Overall would recommend just hope the staff remember it is a hotel and that the guests should come first. ',POOR,

'I'll stay here again the Bryant Park Hotel is a real gem in NYC. The black and red lobby outfitted withhip staff dressed entirely in black is nothing, if not trendy (almost too trendy). However, once past the dark red-lit elevators, you'll find beautiful, light and airy rooms. The rooms are large, have hard wood floors and are of clean modern design. the lighting is superb, the windows large and the linen very high quality. the bathrooms are very large with nice two-person tubs and separate showers with two showerheads (arain and a hand held). Each room has a flatscreen TV, Bose wave radio, and a sound machine that can lull you to sleep. The only thing less than satisfactory were the doormen. Upon arrival at 8:30 pm on Saturday eening, there was not a door man in sight. The doorman were a mystery. sometimes there. Sometimes not. More often, not. That was a slight blemish on the rest of a nic stay. ',GOOD,
'Great Time at Bryant Park Hotel Just got back from a weekend in NY at the Bryant Park, and I have to say I was very pleased. The room was much larger than I thought, modern looking and stylish. The bathroom was huge for NY standards. I am very much into the nightlife scene in NY, and chose this hotel because it had a few things I wanted - a cool bar (Cellar) and restaurant (Koi), and I thought both were great. The hotel in general is very stylish, yet very laid back....exactly what we were looking for - not touristy, somewhat trendy and cool, yet not too sceney or attitudey. Never had a problem with the front desk, as some others have shared. Found them to be very helpful, as well as the door staff and concierge, (booked reservtions, etc for us ) It's across from Bryant Park, which is a great place to just sit and relax in the middle of town. ',GOOD,
'My fourth stay, and still my favourite hotel... I鈥檝e just enjoyed my fourth stay at The Bryant Park. After five nights at the New York Palace on business (an excellent hotel by any standards but where after a week the gold, marble, over-sized floral arrangements and extremely attentive staff all begin to feel a bit much) it was, as always, a pleasure to check in to the BP - my favourite hotel in the city.Why the Bryant Park? Rooms are a good size and well furnished (in an understated way); it has the most comfortable beds, the best bed linen and the bathrooms are gorgeous. The location is superb for Fifth Ave shopping, the Museums or easy access to Soho, East/West Village etc, and I've always found the service be excellent and attentive without being cloying. But what really sells it for me are the views from rooms at the front of the building 鈥?especially above the tenth floor 鈥?which are breath-taking. By NY standards, it鈥檚 excellent value too.I鈥檝e stayed in a junior suite here, which was wonderful, but most recently my 鈥楺ueen size room with view麓 (corner room) was my haven of tranquillity for the weekend. Above the tree canopy of the park, surrounded by the ever-changing skyline of this extraordinary city, I was reminded of why I love NY and the Bryant Park so much - and why I鈥檒l be staying there again. ',GOOD,
'Cool hotel but friendly staff. Loved it! After having stayed at many boutique hotels in NYC (e.g. The Alex and The Library etc), the Bryant Park hotel has to be one of the best we have stayed in so far. After reading some negative reviews, we were a bit hesitant at first, but our experience proved otherwise. The staff were always nice and friendly towards us, we enquired about eating at the popular hotel restaurant Koi at the last minute and the concierge managed to get a nice table for us even though the restaurant was completely full. Our room and bathroom were huge by NY standard (or any standard) and we also had a nice view of the park. The Molten brown bath products were an additional bonus. The cellar bar/ club looked cool but the music was so so on a Friday night. However, we were told by the staff that Sat night is supposed to be the best night to go. There are some minor problems with the hotel, e.g. the lobby is quite small and the constant techno music playing inside the lift/ elevator can be quite annoying at times. Besides that, we would highly recommend this hotel and we will be definitely coming back again very soon. ',GOOD,
'Terrible experiance with front desk staff We stayed at this Hotel in November and I must advise future guests that in all my years of travel,having stayed in some of the very best hotels around the world.I have never experienced such terrible service by the front desk staff and management.i would not stay at this hotel again ever,totaly disinterested in dealing with any problems.What terrible attitude and lack of customer service .Quite nice rooms. ',POOR,
'actually a good value we recently rented out the penthouse suite for an event. I want to mention that the staff went above and beyond in an effort to insure our success, and it did. The penthouse is really a great value (for a splurge)...a sleek rather West Elm style suite with fantastic views north/west/south. A terrace, tiny but nice. Fantastic baths, 2 of them and a great bedroom. The suite also has.2 large plasma tvs, stereos, ipod hook-ups, printers and etc... With the dining table and good catering I would reccomend the hotel for anything special...and the cost of the penthouse is great when compared to the same at other ny hotels and it really feels like a penthouse!THANKS ',GOOD,
'Loved it - will never stay anywhere else I just returned from a long weekend in NYC, I do this trip often and this was my first time staying at The Bryant Park hotel ... I will never stay anywhere else again!!! I have stayed in a lot of hotels in NYC and I have never even bothered to write a review because they were just blah ... nothing really bad to say, nothing good to say. However, The Bryant Park Hotel, I can't stop talking about it. I work in a travel agency and I am literally calling clients who go to NYC often to tell them that they have to stay there. Our room was huge by NYC standards, the bathroom was huge. The bedding was to die for, bright bright room. Right across the street from Bryant Park which just makes you feel like your not in a noisy city even though you are. The Hotel is on 40th between 5th  6th ... close to everything but has the feel of being far away when you are there. The Cellar Bar was beautiful and a very hip spot. I have read previous reviews and the ones that say it was like a night club NOT TRUE AT ALL but It's New York City if you don't like all the energy you won't like anywhere you stay in NYC. Once you get into that elevator (which by the way there is never a wait to get into them) you are away from all the noise and energy. Sit in the park during the day you somehow don't notice the noise its just so beautiful. When we were in our room we did not hear anything from the halls or surrounding rooms and the Hotel was booked solid. A very good looking staff ... if you have our luck, ladies be prepared to be checked in by very handsome men. We so enjoyed our stay very very much I have never stayed in a hotel in NYC and spent so much time in and around our room/hotel. I will never stay anywhere else Bryant Park will be my new home away from home. ',GOOD,
'Loved the details I stayed here for 2 nights in Feb 13. I am usually hard to please, but the details impressed me. I booked a deluxe room 1604, one step up from their standard room. I was a little small, but perfect for myself here on business. It may not be worth it to pay the money for the upgrade. I found a good deal on ---- and got the deluxe for cheaper than the standard rate. I'll tell you about the things I loved first:-the bathroom was beautiful! a wonderfully powerful rainfall showerhead with independent handheld showerhead. long bath tub and beautiful sink. and the bathroom was about the same size as the bedroom area minus the closet and entry. robes, slippers, and superlong bath towels were a plus. i'm picky about details, so I was pleased to find that the next day the bathroom was completely spotless and there weren't even water marks on the faucet knobs or spouts.-The room decor was modern and simple. the pillows are the best! better than at the venetian - and that's pretty good. flatscreen tv was nice. You'll want to use the sound machine in the room since sometimes the honking becomes a bit much. -if you get room service at midnight, the turkey club is one of the best i've had ( and i'm not saying that because it's the only thing substantial to eat on the 6-item-menu at midnight) -Trendy magazines in your room for your leisure: gotham, vantity fair, vogue. sweet! even some office supplies on the desk: highlighter, binder clips.i was pretty pleased with the whole experience, but somethings they could improve were:-the sound from the hallway was louder than I and hoped, although it didn't seem like I could hear my neighbors through the wall.-the elevators are small and can barely accomodate 3 ppl + luggage-the noise from the street is kinda unavoidable.-they charged me for a $6 bottle of sparkling water that I didn't order. (but i didn't notice until i was on the plane home)overall, i was pretty impressed and would stay again if the price was decent. ',GOOD,
'Great stay at the Bryant park Hotel We stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel and loved it. The front desk was so helpful and the room was large, clean with a wonderful large bathroom and shower. We had a balcony with spectacular views. Location, location..... the hotel was a quick walk to Times Sq./ Grand Central and MOMA. We would definately stay again. ',GOOD,
'Great experience We really loved our experience here!1) We took a red-eye flight and arrived into NY around 5:30am, the hotel allowed us to check-in (eventhough their official check-in time is 3:00pm).2) The room was fairly large for NY, large soaking tub, cashmere blanket, plasma tv, cd's w/ bose stereo, closet, nice modern design...clean and comfortable.3) The front desk staff was ALWAYS helpful and never snooty, even at 6:00am.4) Koi Restaurant (in the hotel) - very trendy, very delicious 5) Great location, walking distance to the Broadway Theatre, where we saw The Color PurpleBottom line, great modern hotel, great service, hip crowd, no attitude. Probably wouldn't pick this hotel if I had three kids or grandma was with us... ',GOOD,
'Chic but friendly Our stay for a weekend getaway was great. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite facing Bryant Park. The room was absolutely huge by NYC standards. Decor was modern and minimalist but that's what I expected. Amenities were top notch. Contrary to some postings here, I found the staff to be very friendly and accomodating and neither of us are models :). The location is great...close to Times Square but without the masses, plus a 5 minute walk to Grand Central. We will stay here again. ',GOOD,
'And the beat goes on! This hotel tries too hard to be chic. If it just relaxed a little, some of its natural beauty would show through. For example, in the hotel brochure it talks about the importance of getting a reservation at the restaurant since it tends to book up early with the A list crowd. Now give me a break. If you have to talk about it, then it probably isn't A list to begin with.The architecture is neat, including the lobby and the cellar bar. The room we had, 804 was very small. The bathroom was the same size as the bedroom. The bed was a double, not a Queen as we requested and it was a bit tight for two people ( booked as a standard room through Expedia). The bathroom was very nice and the amenities were top flight. The choice of CDs for the Bose system was OK, but all of them had the same disco, runway beat that plays everywhere in the hotel, including the elevators, healthclub and Cellar bar. It would be a bit more relaxing to get away from the beat now and then.The hotel does not have a lobby in which you could meet friends and the bar had continuous throbbing music, so it wasn't a good place to talk. If you want to have a quiet conversation in public ( as opposed to in your room), then this is not the hotel for you. Overall, I would stay here again, but at the rate we paid, it wasn't a bargain or a must revisit. ',POOR,
'Not impressed The hotel is very chic and trendy and the cellar bar hosts the beautiful people nightly, a plus if that's your thing. I was not impressed by the lack of service and facilities in the hotel, there is no hotel lobby or bar to sit and meet people or relax during the day, the staff are a little aloof and if you do not fit into the surroundings they would seem to prefer you not be there. When you return back to the hotel on an evening you will be met by cue's of people waiting to get into the cellar bar, this give you the feeling of staying at a night club. On the plus side the rooms are very spacious and well apointed. ',POOR,
'Well, Here is the way it is. We were at the Bryant Park for a full week in the Raymond Hood Suite - so here is the real truth.1. The room was NYC big. A nice layout with two balconies and two - yes two flat panel televisions. Our room had a Bose player for my I-Pod and every type of stereo I could ask for.2. The Bathroom was excellent - but needs a little more storage. Ours had a steam shower which was a suprise since I never saw it mentioned anywhere. I wish it had a seat but it was very relaxing.3. The view of the Empire State Building was awsome - fills the bedroom window. Ask for the side that face the ESB. 4. The hard wood floors are well worn and make the rooms seem a bit older than I think they really are. The same as the throw rugs and the lack of art. The room decor is fashinable but it needs a bit more life.5. The bed was soft and the sheets very correct. I slept well every night.6. Room service was inflexible - they could not make even the slightest changes and you can't get food from the very good returant Koi - except what they allow. 7. The location is perfect - you can walk to it all - the subway is right there.8. Free wireless in Bryant Park - I walked down every day to get my mail. 9. The Staff was very helpful - but you do need to ask for the help. Be specific and they respond with specifics but they are young and have a young persons focus.10. The building is nice and the feel is hip but the touch of it all lacks the flair and sophistication of a Ritz or a Four Seasons - but then again for the same price as a base room in the Ritz I got all of the above.In the end it is a good hotel - not great - but solid. I recommend the Bryant Park - but with one last BIG problem. We could hear everything that the people in the next room were saying - lucky us it was empty for 6 of our 7 days - if it had not been, no matter how much I liked it I would have probably moved. ',GOOD,
'Fun, Comfortable, and Accomodating We stayed at the BP for 7 nights. Business for my husband, pleasure for myself.This hotel is perfect for 20-40 somethings looking for a fashionable, upbeat, hip experience with the price tag to match. Rooms vary widely, you may want to ask to see a couple and choose. Cellar Bar is fun people watching and good music. It is packed on the weekends, with a line outside. If you are coming back to the hotel during the chaos, the Hotel Doormen move people aside to get you in if you are staying at the hotel. Makes you feel taken care of. Koi has delicious food and friendly staff (although don't go too late or they seem to forget about you). If you need to go somewhere on Thurs-Sat, may want to have them arrange a car, cabs are HARD to come by, even though the Doormen are great about trying.Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly staff and prompt service (even though we came in late). We were in the superior category (their base model). Our room was on the 15th floor (1501). It was a corner room with large (for NYC) open floor space, modern decor, comfy bed, cool furnishings, tasty treats in the mini, and huge windows. Only problem, we requested a non-smoking room, and smoke was coming in from all directions. Yuck.After a move to a smaller, noisy room for one night(still in the same category, we complained and they said it was all they had for that night) they moved us to 1801, same larger room as 1501 without the smoke. Better view as well. Concierge is not always available and did not always return phone calls. BUT when we worked with Adrienne and she did a FABULOUS job of arranging anything we needed as well as making excellent dining recs. The staff in total was helpful and friendly.Get your hair done at Pipino by Hector, get a workout in the clean user friendly gym, relax and enjoy the city. And quit your complaining. ',GOOD,
'Don't even bother, they don't! I have never encountered a more incompetent staff and management than I have at this hotel. I am a hotel manager myself and because of this, I am very forgiving as I understand that mistakes can happen. However, they went too far on this one. The hotel property itself is interesting, if you like your hotel to feel like a night club. This did not bother me as I was looking for something with unique character. The rooms are very modern, but bland. Housekeeping is fine, but not great. But the thing that makes a difference in a property is service. And the service is aweful!!This stay was to be charged to a third person credit card as we were in NY on business and pleasure and we were charging this back to a business account. All of the paperwork was taken care of prior to our arrival and this was confirmed when we checked in. We were entertaining clients on the first evening, so we purchased 2 junior suites. There was to be a king bed in one and two queens in another. We arrived and they had us in two rooms with double beds. They showed us another option for the king, which we took, but it was much smaller and I don't believe it was in fact a junior suite.That first night, we ordered champagne with the clients (about $2K). The room service attendant was very nice. When I got up the next morning, I had scheduled 2 massages in my guest room for myself and my girlfriend. The massage therapists were 20 minutes late and then the concierge called to inform me that the hotel does not permit charges of massages to a guest account--HE TOLD ME THIS WHEN THE THERAPISTS WERE KNOCKING ON MY DOOR!!We had the treatment and then I offered the therapists my credit card; they said they could not take the credit card, but they always were able to charge it to the room. So this is what I did and called down stairs to inform them of this. I was called 5 minutes later by the concierge who told me I must get up (after a relaxing massage) and go 2 blocks to the ATM as I had to give the therapists cash-- I did not have $400 in cash on me. I did this and then apologized to the therapists who were kept waiting. I told them that I had not been informed of the hotel policy and was frankly rather surprised. The concierge WINKED at me and made a dismissive gesture. I told him I would bring this up with his manager which he invited me to do. Then I found out why.I got up to my room and there was a message from the front office manager who told me that I must bring a credit card to the front desk as they were not able to do third party billing. One might ask-- why do you have a credit card authorization form if you do not accept third party billing. And why would you confirm that everything was in good order upon check in. To this, I got many responses. 1. Credit Card was declined (I verified that this was not the case)2. Third party billing is never allowed (contrary to what we were told when booking)3. Third party billing was only permitted for $100.I brought down my own card and this is what we used to settle the charges. I asked for the Front Office Manager's card as I was not ever able to connect with her when I was at the property. I told her of my experience via email and she did not reply. It was not until after I emailed the director of sales that I heard back from the manager I tried to contact. She made no effort of an apology and removed $200 from the final bill. I told her that frankly, this was a disaster and that I wanted a damn good explination for why it happened. Again, my emails were not returned, and the answer to the question about third party billing is still a mystery-- Particularly in light of the fact that an additional $200 showed up on the third party billing card after they told me this was not possible. They say this was minibar, but as we took no more than $50 from the minibar, I am sure they were just making up for the previous adjustment.With so many better places to stay, please do not even consider this one. New York has too much to offer. ',POOR,
'Best hotel in New York yet My husband and I stayed on the 22nd floor in a junior suite of this fabulous hotel. We have been to New York on two other occasions and both the hotels were dingy and dirty (and one of those was The Plaza). However, the Bryant Park Hotel was fantastically clean, it was bright, comforatable and ultra modern. It was also very spacious which is a real luxury in NY. We loved the deep bath, the huge shower and the bath products were a luxurious treat. The location was fantastic. A five minute walk to Fifth Avenue and a ten minute walk to Times Square. The hotel staff were always polite and courteous and very efficient. This is a hotel that we will definitely be visiting again and again. ',GOOD,
'Great 4 star hotel! I highly recommend the Bryant Park Hotel -- our deluxe queen/park view room was modern, super-clean and large (for NYC), with lots of windows and light. The hardwood floors in the room, and the big marble bathrooms with separate tub and shower were great. Comfortable bed, nice linens. We definitely would stay there again. ',GOOD,
'Cool, Hip, Trendy And with Good Service Spent one night, 7/23/05, in a Queen Deluxe View room (#404) and have nothing but rave reviews to give. Highlights:1) Customer Service--top notch, from an easy, 1 minute check in right at check in time to checking out and having the bellhop walk down 40th St to hail me a cab. Every employee we saw was helpful and polite with no attitude.2) Rooms--simply put, they're cool. Minimal decor, but what furniture they do have is comfortable, clean, and modern. Nice hardwood floors with plush throw rugs. Awesome flat panel TV hooked on wall. Bed was great as well. Hugh bathrooms, walk-in shower, separate tub.3) Location--hard to beat, only a block or two from theatre district. Hotel is on a less-traveled street it seems, and Bryant Park is across the street. Didn't go to the Cellar or Koi, which are the popluar bar and restaurant at the property.If staying on a weekend, highly recommend requesting a high floor. I was on 4th floor right above the main entrance and heard the bar/restaurant crowd until 4 am. Minor point, at least for me, and didn't detract from my stay. ',GOOD,
'The place to stay when visiting the city!!! For our first trip to New York, I looked at every hotel the city offered and decided upon the Bryant Park. It was everything and more than I wanted in a hotel. It provides the perfect mix of trendy  luxury. The staff was wonderful and very helpful.It is my understanding that some rooms are small, so I would recommend the suites. I booked a Junior suite and requested a room on a high floor with a view of the park. When we walked into our room, we were amazed! The room was extremely spacious and the bathroom was amazing with a separate tub and shower. Then we walked out a tall glass door and were met with a private rooftop balcony overlooking Bryant Park. Very few rooms have balconies, so I would recommend specifically asking for one. Room 2003 is perfect!We spent a late night at Cellar Bar - that although not very busy, it had a good scene. Another night we had a drink in Koi - we did not eat, but the food looked amazing.Every evening upon our return to the hotel, we were met with velvet ropes at the front door and asked to show our key. It was nice to have the extra security.The Bryant Park far exceeded my expectations. While you felt as though there was definitely a scene at the hotel, it was extremely private. Within walking distance to all attractions, but a few blocks outside of the craziness of Times Square. The park itself was wonderful and it provided a great place to sit and rest at the end of a long day.I can't wait to return! ',GOOD,
'A real find in the middle of manhattain We stayed at the Bryant Park in the week leading up to our wedding at the Empire State Building - so we were expecting a lot!We didn't want to stay in one of the traditional 'New York Plaza' type hotels and opted instead for the Bryant Park which is centrally located but with a fabulous view of Bryant Park and the New York Public Library beneath. It's location means that you are right in the middle of everything without all the noise and touristy bits of a Times Square Hotel. The fact that you can walk out of the hotel in the morning and go and sit in a park is also a huge selling feature - you really get the best of both worlds.The hotel itself is very popular with fahionistas (which we are not!). We travelled as a couple with our 15 month son, and the 2 mother-in-law's to be - so potentially we could have been very out of place!!! On arrival you are wowed by the big red leather reception desk fronted by some very attractive men (and women according to my now husband!). The staff could not have been more helpful, they will organise anything for you - even if you fancy chocolate dipped cherried with champagne at 3am (don't ask!). They were even fantastic with our son and would happily do baby listening for us if we wanted to have a drink in the bar.The rooms were very spacious by New York standards with fabulously clean cut decor, the bathrooms were divine.The restaurant in the hotel was also well worth a visit (bit on the pricey side though). The Cellar Bar is crazy, full of New Yorks finest, you really get to see a different side of things! The key in this hotel is to ask for a Razmopolitan as soon as you arrive, like the entrance, they're red and once you've tried one you'll definately go back - to the bar and this hotel! ',GOOD,
'Modern Elegance meets NYC Flare TOPLINE: Ultra modern, trendy boutique with large, comfortable rooms. This hotel is ideal for the young and the young at heart looking to experience the flare of NYC. Located on 40th between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the Bryant Park features modern decor, and is set in the heart of midtown Manhattan. Venture down the hotel steps to be greeted by a wonderful urban park inviting you to mingle with urbanites. Venture further from the hotel and you stumble upon Fifth Avenue shopping, the Manhattan Mall (Seventh and 32nd) as well as the Empire State Builing, Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Broadway. If you're headed downtown, simply jump on the Red line located on 42nd. This is the hotel to splurge on - enjoy the location and modern feel.The rooms are well sized, and include a CD player, large tub for two, separate shower and soaps and lotions that my wife loved. While we did not have the opportunity to visit the sushi restuarant or the Bar, it did appear that the Bryant Park was the place to be. Having stayed on the 11th floor, I did not encounter any of the street noise that some reviewers note. The gym on the fifth floor is more than suitable for travelers. If you're interested in catching a broadway show you can purchase discounted tickets (35%-50% off) the day of the show at TKTS. The location in Times Square is the most popular and features lines in excess of 2 hours. The trick is to jump on the Red line and head down to the Southside Seaport. Get off the subway at Fulton and go to the TKTS located on John and Front. Head over there after 2:00pm when tickets are released and wait a mere 5 minutes. ',GOOD,
'Good points and bad The good: The rooms were lovely - spacious bedroom and bathroom, with great freebie soaps and stuff. Nice to have a CD player in the room. Service was fine, nothing bad to report.The bad: The Bryant Park is a hotel that thinks it's a nightclub. It's quite noisy if you're trying to sleep and you're facing the park itself, and the breakfasts in the room were really not that great considering what I've heard about NY brekkies. ',GOOD,
'Good deal in NYC       view of terrace and living area of junior suite ',GOOD,
'Pleasant surprise I read reviews about The Bryant Park before booking a special rate on Expedia, and was a little worried that our stay may not have been worth the price we were paying for a junior suite. Luckily, I turned out to be wrong...I called the hotel the day before to let them know that I may arrive early and asked, if possible, for an early check-in. When I arrived the next morning, the front desk greeted me warmly, granted me access to my room, and I was even further pleased to discover that my special request had been granted (for a separate tub (large one as well!) and shower stall, plus a view of the park). Overall, our room was simple yet tastefully decorated and I loved the large windows which allowed plenty of natural light (not to worry for those who don't - screens and drapes are on all windows to block out the light). The location of the hotel was perfect. It's within walking distance to both Grand Central (10 mins) and Penn Station (15 - 20 mins), 2 blocks from the heart of Times Square, and major stores (Macy's, Victoria's Secret, Gap etc) and shopping avenues (Madison, 5th). I also fell in love with Bryant Park - the perfect place to take your breakfast, lunch, etc. or to relax on a beautiful day. I certainly recommend Pax, the cafe/deli on the corner by the hotel, for good food at a reasonable price. Also, if you are a sushi lover, book reservations at Koi, the restaurant in the hotel...a little pricey but well worth it.All in all, my stay was a memorable one. I will be returning to The Bryant Park... ',GOOD,
'awesome my boyfriend recently took me there 2weeks ago for the first - i loved it -so close to 5th ave and the staff was great , we also went to the bar inside which was alot of fun! i loved it!! ',GOOD,
'best linen ever I have to say my highlight staying here was the bed linen It was sensational - enough so i really wanted to buy some!We had a great overnight stay - lay in the park, service was fine although we didnt eat at the restuaraunt. its a great location with tonnes of stuff to do around there, would suggest you stay here a few nights  then go downtown so you get a slice of both worlds. ',GOOD,
'Better than expected I like NY and part of the thrill for me is staying at different hotels.I paid $224 per night for a deluxe room with bath (vey deep and long) and a separate glassed off wet room/shower with a view of Bryant Park.The room was stunning, better than the Soho Grand, 60 Thompson, Paramount etc.The doormen and reservationists were friendly and efficient. Macey's and Times Square just a short stroll away.I arrived at 11pm on a Thursday night and was not confronted with a nightclub scene! ',GOOD,
'Not a Hotel, but a social club Terrible, terrible hotel. Service unbelievably bad. Check-in was chaotic. Everything you ask the staff to do is too much trouble, they seem to think that they are far to cool to be dealing with anything. On the third night of our stay we returned to the room to a very rude message saying that if we hadn't checked out of the room by 12 we would be charged for an extra night. When I pointed out to the staff we were staying a further two nights they said we know you are, as if this was perfectly normal. I would have let this go, it they hadn't done exactly the same thing the next day!! Worse still they then charged my credit card for the late checkouts on the two nights, even though I was already paying to stay there!! This took over four months to sort out - and at no point did I ever get an apology. The bar is great here - but if you are looking for a hotel please, please think again.I won't ever be returning. ',POOR,
'Good location Contemporary hotel in an ideal location for sightseeing and shopping. Right next to a subway station and an easy walk to Times square make this an ideal choice for those on a long weekend visit. We had a room at the front of the hotel on one of the lower levels which gave a great view of the park but it could be noisy outside at night with work being undertaken in the park opposite, however this was the usual level of urban noise that you frequently get in in city centre hotels. Although the bar is pricey this reflects the general area the hotel is located in and there are plenty of alternative venues close to hand. Area felt safe at night (with usual sensible precautions) to walk in. Numerous places to eat in the local vicinity if you move off the main roads. Staff were pleasant and housekeeping excellent. I would recommend primarily on the back of its location and cleanliness. ',GOOD,
'Water woes Stayed at the Bryant Park for two nights in August. Got a fantastic rate on a deluxe room through a third party website, but when we checked in we were initially charged a higher rate. Fortunately, I had a printed confirmation with me and the confirmed rate was honored. Furnishings were fabulous to look at but not the most comfortable. The shocker was actually the shower- the water started out warm and as the shower progressed the water became freezing cold. We contacted the front desk and a maintenance person arrived almost immediately. He noted that since the occupancy was a little low it would take time for the hot water to circulate. After letting the water run for a full 5-6 minutes we finally had hot water. Unfortunately, the mixer on the shower must not have been working well because we could not adjust the temperature to a comfortable level. The same thing happened the following day. I also noticed a huge tear in one of the bathrobes provided with the room. We were given drink coupons for the Cellar Bar, but when we popped down there during bar hours it was deserted and the bartender was no where to be seen. For approximately the same room rate, I recommend the Benjamin. ',POOR,
'You're on your own.... We stayed at this hotel the day after getting engaged, to prolong and enjoy our engagement weekend. We totally agree with the reviews about poor service and not being able to decide whether they are a night club. When we checked in, told them that we had just gotten engaged and could they give us a romantic room/make our stay special... They told us they were giving us a room overlooking the park (also what we reserved). Our room actually overlooked a rooftop with the park allllll the way to the right. Nothing special was done for us. When we asked for help with dinner reservations, they were completely clueless (the front desk receptionist didn't ever hear the term Tapas Bar) - and for some reason there was no concierge on duty at 8pm on a saturday evening. We had to find our own restaurant, and when we did, we were finally helped in making a reservation. The rooms were clean and pretty chic in their decor. The lobby was pretty funky but very loud when you first walked in and definitely felt like you were walking into a dance club. The door man didn't open the door for us once. If you don't want anyone to bother you or help you, this is the place to stay! ',POOR,
'Great Location for seeing the city The Bryant Park is ideally situated in midtown NY. It has a subway station right next door and Times Square is 2mins away. The room was great, especially the bathroom. Large TV, CD, robes, excellent beds....all as you'd expect from a quality hotel. When you enter it does feel more like a nightclub than hotel, its all black and red decor with the staff in all black outfits and dance music piped throughout. As a base to see the city its ideal and if you like nightlife and a 'cool' scene its definately the place to be. However if you want traditional grandeur in your hotel choice you may want to try somewhere else. ',GOOD,
'Bryant Park needs to work on the service The Bryant Park Hotel is a nice hotel with a great location. However the service was not the best. My husband and I were working in New York when my grandfather passed away in VA. There was a snow storm that had just come thru and a lot of flights were canceled. We needed to stay an extra night b/c of the weather and there was only 1 flight to Virginia where the funeral was being held. They gave me attitude and said, Well we're sold out tonight, but I can put you on a list.. Perhaps they didn't realize that no one would be able to fly in to the city and wouldn't be checking in or maybe they are just really rude and insensitive. I've stayed at numerous hotels in New York and have never seen such poor customer service.That incident aside the hotel staff seemed to lack the initiative to make guests feel welcome. And I totally agree with the review that stated that they need to decide if they are a hotel or a night club. The night club crowd is not what you want to see when you've spent all day working in the city. The lobby music is horrible (and I'm in my twenties)! On a positive note I will say that the restuarant ILO is pretty good (again the AM service was not so great). It's not the worst hotel...it's also not the best. ',POOR,
'Great place, nice location This is a nice place to stay at while visiting NY. The rooms are very trendy and the hotel bar is very cool as well as the restaurant. The hotel is right across the street from Bryant Park and if you get a nice day the park is beautiful and romantic to stroll through. They even thought of little details like an umbrella in the room which we used at midnight to take a midnight stroll thru times square two blocks away.This is a nice place and if you are looking for a nice place in Midtown this could be a winner! ',GOOD,
'Freezing cold in New York My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights from 31/03/04 to 05/04/04 to celebrate our first wedding annevisary.The hotel at first glance is quite an attractive property and is well located for most points of interest in the city.The issue with the hotel is lack of service!!Our room was very cold and we were unable to increase the temperture of the room via the inroom control panel.We contacted the front desk only to be told that the hotels heating system was off but they would have a person come to the room to check the controls.Having looked at the system the repair man said there was afault with the system and it was blasting out cold air.He agreed to come back the next morning to fix it.He did not return.We complained again.Again a repair man came and agreed the room was very cold.He was unable to fix the problem by which time we were leaving.Despite having the issue brought to the attention of the hotel manager,no attempt was made to contact us or even apologise.My advice next time you visit New York is to pay the extra and stay in a proper,established property and not one that seems to be unable to decide if it is a hotel or a night club. ',POOR,
'Awesome!!!!!!!!!! What can I say anything thing other than AWESOME! We were treated spectacularly from start to finish! The Concierge Michael got us awesome Broadway show tickets, the staff was on top of all our needs and we paid for one package but upgraded automatically to a beautiful 7th floor, grand deluxe overlooking the park. We stayed at The Iroquois last trip and while it was a beautiful hotel, The Bryant Park surpassess the Iroquois on all levels! This is going to be Our Hotel for all our trips into Manhattan. I will say that the staff stated that Fashion weeks are not the optimal time stay there unless you are part of Fashion week, they are crazy busy and rooms are limited! This is our new NYC Home!

'Terrible location it was supposed to be the best hotel in Barcelona, but...It is just too far away from the city itself. No way to walk around the area. It is either renting a car or a taxi. It does have some amazing views, but definitely too far away. ',POOR,
'Very nice hotel, but...       Room ',GOOD,
'Location, location, location As other reviewers note, this hotel has fabulous views over Barcelona. In all other respects it is not what it claims to be, e.g. the best address in Catalunya or, for that matter, a world leading hotel. A great deal of effort and no doubt money has gone into the design aspect, yet the result is peculiarly lacking in personality and the finish is poor close-up. The giant water features are somehow reminiscent of a shopping mall. My junior suite was more simply bare than, say, deliberately minimalist, and the wooden floors were severely gouged by furniture being dragged about. The restaurant produces complicated food in tiny portions with amazingly little flavour for the amount of work that went into it, and at high prices. Service is charming but youthfully inefficient and though the service my room card hung on the door of my suite all day - on a busy landing, not hidden away in a corridor - the room was only actually serviced at 7 p.m.So, provided you can get a good rate, go for the views - but in that case, why not just go for lunch? The place is too far from town to be a convenient base for visiting Barcelona. ',POOR,
'What a view! The hotel Gran la Florida truly exceeded our expectations. Our room was very luxurious with two balconies and fabulous views over to the mountains and to the city. We were here on our honeymoon and we didn't want to leave the hotel although it was our first time in Barcelona.The Spa's pool area was spectacular and the whirlpool had very warm water.The hotel is a bit far from the city, but it offers complimentary shuttle service. Breakfast was ok, but not as luxurious as you would wait from a five star hotel. The staff was great: very helpful and always with a smile. Gran la Florida offered really good value for the money and we will definitely come back here. ',GOOD,
'over price we have just been to la gran florida fo two days , we had a deluxe room with view on the parking , view to attraction parcit shouldn't be a deluxe room.the room was noisy and awful view,,,,service is ok but it should be better for a leading hotel , they forgot few things during the breakfastwe had two lunch at the snack , the food is not bad but its not good either it just ok , its quite exepnsive fo Barcelona. we order some tapas and hamburger , all food was just ok , nothing really good...I don t mind to pay at all but Iam expecting a better service and qualite..the hotel is locating close attraction parc so yo could heard people sceraming and laughing from your room ..i think it s very nice design hotel but the service and the qualite has to be improved.I complain to t0eh reception about my deluxe room , they offered 102 euros discount,.,i will not come back to the hotel .as a member of leading hotel the qualiet and service should be higher.

'Sunday Cava brunch! We love this place - even though we only live 40 km away in Sitges, we go there for the all you can drink cava brunch on a Sunday - a fabulous buffet, all you can drink cava, and stunning views over the whole of Barcelona. Only this time instead of falling into a taxi to take us home, my partner booked a room for us to stay in. The room was beautifully furnished, although it was beginining to look like it needed a few little touch ups. The view was stunning over the Med and the National Park. The staff were gracious and pleasant, which beleive me, in Catalonia is definitely not the norm. Next day a hearty breakfast and a dip in the beauutiful metalic infinity pool, followed by a lunchtime Mojito. I love it! ',GOOD,

'Nice room and spa, some service problems Nicely renovated hotel, blending modern style with Art Nouveau. Lovely large room with seating area, great view of Barcelona and a gorgeous bathroom (huge separate shower). Very high standards of housekeeping.The spa is superb, with an indoor/outdoor steel pool, saunas and a good fitness room.The service had some of the greatest contrasts I have ever seen: world class at the front door and the reception, terrible (very young and inexperienced) in the restaurants, the bar and the spa. The food ranged from average to bad, including the breakfast buffet (mini jars of Hero jam!).The location is great if you want to get away from the city for a few days, but it is not good for visiting Barcelona. The shuttle only accomodates six and has an awkward schedule. Public transportation to the centre is complicated. ',POOR,
'Heaven in the hills It was my 60th birthday and my dear wife wanted to treat me to a romantic long weekend to Barcelona. We chose La Gran Florida as our base and from the moment we arrived we knew we had made a great choice. Our welcome at the hotel was absolutely superb, check in efficient and friendly and service impeccable. Our room was stunning with views stretching miles. I could go on and on but both my wife and I agreed that this was the best hotel we had ever stayed at. In fact we loved it so much we didn't venture into Barcelona at all preferring to enjoy the hotel instead. The stainless steel pool, the secluded sun decks and the position high on a hill overlooking the whole of Barcelona are good enough reasons alone worth checking in. However, the food is as spectacular as the setting. Most important of all every member of staff from the manager to the bell hop made us feel really special. I have seen reviews refering to the hotel as expensive but I would prefer to describe it as exceptional value for money when you receive this level of service and quality. We have vowed to return at the earliest opportunity. After many years in the travel industry I strongly urge you to experience this wonderful hotel. ',GOOD,
'Disappointement!!! -It is FAR FROM BARCELONA!!!not what they say on their website-at least 20-25 min-The Shuttle is not Flexible-Taxi Cabs (most) will not give you a rid up to Hotel-It is Noisy -There is a Park Next to it-The Rooms are Retro Fit-The Food/Beverage so Expensive!!! a Burger is around 35 Dollars! and one Tea (Room service) is around 15 Dollars!-They Charged Extra on My Credit Card without my approval!!! when my trip was prepaid, I had to deal with them for one month. No Apology, No Email ReturnThe good points:-The Bathroom and Pool ',POOR,
'Shoddy Service, Not Worth the price I was expecting a great hotel, and really got spotty service for the rates of 500+ euros we paid. My wife and I stayed over 10 days in La Florida, and yes the location is beautiful and the rooms are OK, but service was bad to terrible specially in the restaurant and in the room. We had a huge leak in our junior suite (room 502), we reported this two days in a row, and nothing happenend. We did not even get an apology. Turn down service was on and off, sometimes they closed the drapes and left water, and sometimes they forgot. our complementary arrival 'gift' if you can call it, was a bottle of water and the card didn't even have my name.Finally, the restaurant service was poor and quite slow. The second morning, after paying 56 euros for a continental breakfast, we ordered some poached eggs. After 45 minutes we asked our waiter for the eggs again, and she literally said its not my problem, its the kitchen. My wife that worked at the Four Seasons for 5 years tells me that this would have been a suspension or firing of the waitperson. We did get our eggs after 1 hour. Finally, their shuttle service only fits 6 people, they have 70 rooms, so you will really not get to downtown barcelona, so its 15 euros each way, to get to downtown. You can't walk it. So add this to your costs. Its not the cost, but just the nuisance to call a cab every day, and wait another 15 minutes. So, you are better off staying at Hotel Arts, or the Majestic these are truly great and professional hotels.The only highlight was a Brazilean lady in the concierge/reception staff, she did a great job for us in some difficult restaurant reservations. Don't pay 500麓Euros if you want only the view, you can go to the La Florida bar in the afternoon, have a great time, and pay 100 euros, and stay in a better hotel. Regards,Erik Seiersen ',POOR,
'Wonderful Experience I used Trip Advisor to learn about this hotel so I wanted to give-back to the Trip Advisor community. I booked this hotel as a special graduation gift for me and my 18-year-old niece. We were also joined by my friend. The three of us stayed in the charming roof terrace suite, featuring a private sun deck, views of the mountains and sea, and a wonderful bathroom. The rate was $966 Euros per night, per the rates quoted on the site.Things that delighted us:The room was wonderful and exactly as described on the website--large, modern, beautiful. Breathtaking views from the deck. Best ammenities ever--robes, slippers, chocolates, stereo system, L'Occitaine bath products. Free access to WIFI.We liked the semi-remote location on the hill overlooking the city. We had just spent a week in the center of Madrid and it was nice to have several days up in the hills.The staff was gracious, helpful and goodlooking. The young staff was very international with--we spoke to staffers from Spain, Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, the United States, and Portugal. Communication was very easy.The shuttle to-and-from the city from the hotel was very convenient. It gave us the freedom we wanted and security that we could get back without hassle.The buffet breakfast was terrific, with a wide variety of fruits, breads, meats, fish, and sweets. Great service in a nice sunny atmosphere.Nice spa treatments--book ahead of time by at least a day if you can so that the hotel may get the right type of spa specialist for you.The pool area bar was wonderful during the day and evening. We sunned, swam, rested, drank and ate there several hours per day. In some ways we wasted the sun-deck in our room. We liked the atmosphere of the pool bar.Things that could have been better:The hotel is very intimate, which means you are really aware of the other people around you. During our stay there were two groups of business people staying at the hotel--a young group of Brits and a group of French representatives from the Dodge motor company. Whenever these groups came to breakfast or the pool bar their phones were ringing or they were powering up computers. This was slightly annoying because they changed the entire atmosphere of the restaurant or bar--seeing them made me think of work, when I was trying to relax on my vacation and not deal with phones and computers. On the day we were leaving, the hotel announced that they were closing the the pool bar area that night for a special event for the Dodge people. I'm glad we were leaving because that would have been annoying. There is no other place to hang out if the pool area is closed. I recommend that if you are looking for a quiet time here, check first to make sure no groups are staying in the hotel that week.Overall, this was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning in the future.

'The Most Amazing Hotel We Have Ever Stayed In I booked the hotel through Lastminute for my boyfriends birthday but checked the reviews first on Tripadvisor. Lastminute have some great deals for this hotel which make this more affordable. The hotel is stunning so we felt really lucky to have got such a good deal as the prices normally are very high. Room - beautifully decorated, with the biggest bed ever and crisp, expensive bedlinen. We were also lucky to have a room with views of Barcelona.The Bar - I just had to mention this as we still talk about the Vodka Lemonades that we had there which were the nicest we had ever had and we have had a few!! The downside is that you are a cab drive into the city but I prefer that rather than having a noisy hotel in the centre.I would recommend everyone to stay at this hotel once in your lifetime. ',GOOD,
'A Beautiful Retreat My wife and I enjoyed the first night of our honeymoon at this wonderful hotel in the hills above Barcelona. Staff was wonderful. Public areas of the hotel are beautifully done and the hilltop setting offers spectacular views of the city and the med.We upgraded to a Terrace Room with hopes the terrace offered a nice place to enjoy the view. It doesnt. The terrace rooms have no view and are basically patios with fences. Very dissapointing as I think we would have had better views in a less costly room. That said, the bathroom and rainshower were great.Restauraunt was good, not great. Service was very good throughout dinner but problem with a few ants in a dessert was handled poorly by management who rather than simply apologizing and offering a drink offered an excuse. We had a great time and were not banking on a freebie, but were a bit put off by the excuse.Grounds and pool are beautiful. Church atop hill is beautiful and it is worth a climb to the top to see the views. ',GOOD,
'What a setting! The setting is dramatic and as beautiful as at any hotel i've stayed at. The hotel is also lovely, though possibly trying a bit too hard on the boutique stakes (the pool, for instance, whilst it looks amazing and has a real wow factor, it feels its more like something to look at rather than something you would want to have a cool refreshing swim in).The terrace is also amazing and generally the hotel oozes quality. Staff extremely good. Didn't have any meals other than breakfast here, but breakfast was decidedly average i thought.Would i come here again? Yes definitely, on a romantic long weekend. ',GOOD,
'The relentless pursuit of excellence - or otherwise If five stars are to mean anything, it would surely be the relentless pursuit of excellence and a passion for detail. La Florida scores highly in most areas, and performs woefully in others.Let's do the easy bits: stunning location; breathtaking views; gorgeous terrace; warm and attentive restaurant and bar staff; and a truly amazing terrace with our suite.So why fall down on basics like concierge service, room-keeping standards and security?No surprises: I do not consider myself lucky to be the first person in the concierge's five years to have had his room broken in to* and cash stolen. His indifference and the lack of any apology, any explanation or any help marked him out as unfit to do his job and the hotel as well below par.Which brings us to an immutable truth about quality service: it's a cultural thing within a hotel. Either the bosses at the very top share a passionate belief in customer care and transmit that daily to their staff through their every action, or they don't. And at La Florida, customer care is just another box to tick, not part of its philosophy. For a hotel with such potential, that is a great shame.* by the way, there was no sign of a break-in to my room and no explanation as to who else had keys. ',POOR,
'Excellent Hotel. Excellent Staff. My wife and I spent our 10 year anniversary at La Gran Florida. The staff goes above and beyond what I would ever expect here in the USA. They are so incredibly polite and upbeat and they always make sure that you have everything that you need. The view was spectacular at the top of Mt Tibabado, the hotel sits next to one of the most spectacular churches that you can see from anywhere in Barcelona. I noticed that many of the other hotels are in very busy, touristy areas, but this one is all by itself. There was an amusement park close by but it closed in the evening and never made much noise anyway. The Gran Florida was extremely clean well taken care of. The second to last night we were there, I lost my wallet. In a mad frenzie to cancel all of my credit cards, the hotel staff helped me contact everyone in the states and even prepared a bubble bath with candles in our room to help relax us!!! I'm not one for bubble baths, but my wife considered it so thoughtful that a hotel staff would do such a thing. Our best experience was the staff, they really care that the customer is completely satisfied. We would definitely return, no question. ',GOOD,
'Most Luxurious Hotel in Barcelona What a phenomenal hotel! The staff and rooms are beyond anything I've encountered in the US. The hotel sits atop Mt. Tibidabo, a short cab ride from the main attractions of Barcelona but the view is to die for. It's distance from the city gives it a very ultra-exclusive feel. The rooms are state of the art modern and sleek. The restaurant was fabulous. Chef Dani is a genius with food, he created a beef dish that is baked in clay. He monogramed ours with our anniversary date and it was served tableside. You get to break the clay with an antique hammer and then the entree is transferred to a giridon and plated for you. Nice touch. Each course was lovelier than the last. I went to El Bulli a few days later but think I enjoyed the meal at Hotel La Florida better. The stainless steel pool is the only one of it's kind in any hotel and makes the pool area even that much swankier. The staff to guest ratio is high and makes each guest feel as though they have their own staff and/or entourage. What's truly sad is that every hotel after this one.....pales in comparison and you long for the luxury and bankroll to stay here all the time. ',GOOD,
'Glorious Stunning Hotel Stayed in this hotel in December 2007 with my girlfriend (now fiance). I chose this hotel particulary to propose in Barcelona and ensure the weekend was done in style and we were not dissappointed! The room was immaculate, the hotel staff couldn't be more helpful. Great swimming pool as well which merges into another pool on the terrace outside. It is about 10 minutes drive in a taxi from Le Rambles in the centre of town so if you want something in the centre don't chose this hotel, saying that I would return again and stay at this outstanding hotel in Barcelona that had breath-taking views from our room. Not really a hotel to bring children (we left ours at home) but great for romantic breaks, lovers and for peace and tranquility. ',GOOD,
'Breathtaking views Breathtaking views. I have stayed in many great hotels and this is the best I've ever stayed at. The staff are fantastic, the shuttle service is regular and punctual, and the facilities are next to phenomenol!!! Restaurant expensive but worthwhile with table views of the city. Relaxing environment also. Will be returning to the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel! We stayed at the hotel in August this year for a long weekend and thought it was lovely. The rooms where gorgeous, the staff were excellent and the views were breath taking. The only downside was the cost of the mini bar and meals/beverages in the hotel. It is fine to pay extra for a nice hotel, but the mini bar etc.. was very over priced more like day light robbery, so that was slightly disapointing. The spa treatments were also very over priced. But overall for a special break away i would highly recommend it. Be aware though that the hotel is around about 拢18-拢25 taxi drive away from the centre of Barcelona each way. The hotel does have a free shuttle, but it gets full very quickly so book your place well in advance! ',GOOD,
'A true Luxury room with a view This hotel truly is stunning with amazing views of Barcelona. To have all this luxury only 15minutes from Las Ramblas and the Diagonal was sensational.The hotel I would descirbe as urban chic and the infinity outdoor pool (accessed via the indoor pool) was majestic with views over Barcelona that wil be remembered forever !We booked through Design Holidays who saved us huge amounts compared other rates we were quoted by both the hotel directly and other companies.Without question we will return .........

'Great Views, but could be better Stayed in this hotel in October 2007. Stunning views although be prepared for a 20 minute cab ride off peak to get into town. That said, the view alone is worth it!Had a few issues during our stay, the biggest one being that the room we had been given had a shower that was mouldy so that when you opened the door, the bathroom as well as the bedroom was overcome with the smell (unfortunately I am not exaggerating) rendering the shower useless. My partner designs hotels for a living but even I noticed the design floor with the shower set up - it does look good though! We did inform the staff to either fix the problem or move us whilst we were out for the evening, however when we got back, nothing had been done. We ended up moving rooms in the end, but ideally I would not want to have done this at 2am!Other issue was when I was having a massage. Normally you get assigned a special massage bed where you can put your head in a specially designed rest. Unfortunately this was not to be so whilst your having a nice relaxing massage, your head is twisted which is not the most comfortable experience for an hour.Staff were somewhat friendly although the issues with the shower did dampen things somewhat.Overall definitely worth staying due to the view, but don't expect top notch service. ',POOR,
'Too far from the centre 4 of us stayed for 2 nights in October 2007. We had a very good deal from a travel website and paid 拢Sterling 112 per night including breakfast and an upgrade to de-luxe rooms. We all thought that was about the right price and would not have been happy to have paid much more. The staff were very pleasant, the bed was superb, the views were great, breakfast was full of good choices. The downside was the location. 20/25 minutes away from Barcelona centre and a hopeless shuttle bus that ran from 10am to 6 pm and only took a small number of people. Cabs cost around 40 euros return to the centre. My advice is, if you want to see Barcelona book a city centre hotel. Also, in the summer a large theme park/fairground attraction is right next door and that could be noisy. ',GOOD,

'Hotel with a view outside the city center I stayed at Hotel La Florida for one night on September 18th, 2007. As a Leaders Club member I made my reservation through Leading Hotels, the rate for a standard room was 246,10 Euro taxes and breakfast included.There are many nice but also some negative aspects so that I rate this hotel in total with three stars (=neutral/average compared to other top class hotels).But in detail: On the good side were- a prompt doorman service, luggage transfer, personal check-in with a glass of champagne,- guidance to the room with nice introduction to the hotel facilities and history,- upgrade to room no. 501 with Barcelona view and a spacious bath with impressive shower stall, tub and separate toilet,- personal welcome card in room (in my native language), a complimentary bottle of water, fruits and a welcome gift (Zen candle stick),- very nice and clean spa with indoor-/outdoor pool,- cozy atmosphere in the whole hotel and plenty of staff,- restaurant L'Orangerie with good value for money (solid six course tasting menu for 64,20 Euro),- turn down with additional bottles of complimentary water,- free internet access and many copies of international papers in the lobby.On the other hand there were some negative aspects:- the hotel is located in the nowhere of Barcelona, a complimentary shuttle service runs a few times a day but all seats for all shuttles during my stay were already booked when I checked in (at about 3 pm - the maximum capacity are six seats per shuttle only!),- one finally has to use taxis when going to downtown Barcelona what takes first about 15 minutes until a taxi arrives and furthermore costs about 30 to 40 Euro for a return trip to the city center in total (the taxi drivers bill the arrival as well so you start with an amount of 5 to 6 Euro),- there was no clock in the room - not even in the TV or telephone display - and the staff wasn't able to organize any watch or alarm clock during my stay (I had this unusual experience one night before at Casa Fuster Hotel, they finally provided a clock but failed in other things),- there was no shoehorn or any shoe cleaning item in the room and a shoe shine wasn't done overnight (although I placed my shoes outside the door at about 11pm),- annoying minibar pricing: a Coke (0,2 l) costs 8,56 Euro (!) and you won't find any other shops or foodstores in the neighbourhood,- there was no DVD player available, not even on request,- there was plenty of young staff, very friendly but inefficient (e.g. no help with the clock, not even a response/ the headwaiter at L'Orangerie first showed a half board card which wasn't valid for me, came back with the regular card and after request with a tasting menu offer but didn't know what was included in the tasting menu/ the cutlery wasn't replaced as there were no towells replaced in the spa although there were up to four employees around...)Anyhow a nice hotel but not a leader in the hotel business. When you accept the mentioned disadvantages and be prepared staying outside of Barcelona it might be okay. ',POOR,

'Great hotel Great hotel away from city approx 15 euros in a taxi-design suites very special if a little expensive-great staff-amusing to have the small amusement park up the hill didn't detract from the settingLittle short on loungers on terrace full by 10 am -terrace menu limiting main restaurant has to be pre booked-overall throughly recommend ',GOOD,
'Superb accommodation, but overpriced This hotel has so much to offer; beautiful, large, well designed rooms, breathtaking views of Barcelona, the stunning Zen zone where you can enjoy the stainless steel pool or relax on the terrace. The staff on our trip were courteous, professional and helpful. The location of the hotel is problematic and I think they should consider doing more to help guests get in and out of the city. More flexible shuttle trips and, in particular, later shuttle trips to return guest from the city after midnigt would certainly ease the problem. Otherwise it will cost 15 - 20 euros to travel from the city centre. We also found that most of the taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was located (we may have been unlucky) and on our last evening the taxi driver, who appeared drunk, took us on some bizarre route which cost us 25 euros! We did discover that the metro line 7 can take you to Avenue Tibidabo which is at the foot of the mountain and cost us about 10 euros from there to the hotel. However the metro closes at 12pm during the week.While we were happy with the cost of the rooms, the cost of food and drink in the hotel is exhorbitant. I expected to pay a premium for 5*, but the charges are really excessive. The worst example was breakfast which we only had on one day and cost us 68 euros. for this princely sum we were supplied with a meagre selection of very poor quality pastries, some cereal and poorly prepared eggs benendict which was also cold! I don't mind paying more for 5* luxury, but I at least expect to get what I paid for.You will enjoy La Florida - we certainly did, but unless you are happy to fork out 200 euros for a meal (2 people), 56 euros for a basic breakfast (again for 2 people) eat in the city which is relatively inexpensive. Make good use of the shuttle service into the city as this can half your taxi bill and if you are not returning after midnight take the metro to Avenue Tibidabo for a less expensive taxi journey to the hotel. ',GOOD,
'Wonderful Retreat! Beautiful hotel on top of the hill, overlooking the city of Barcelona and the sea. Hotel shuttle bus to town, nice breakfast on the terrace overlooking the sea, extremely wonderful dinner place, not exactly inexpensive but sooo delicious! Great service. Nice pool area. We even walked from the hotel downtown (2 hours thru the beautiful and cool woods) every day and took the shutlle back uphill. The only thing on Saturdays: due to the Tibidabo amusement park nearby it might get a bit loud until well after midnight but who's there to go to bed early anyway! It's not so noisy during the week (only until 9pm or so which is nice). Definitely one of our favorite hotels in the world, small and something special. Make sure to get a room with sea view, it's worth the price difference! ',GOOD,
'Marvelous boutique hotel After a long and bumpy taxi ride from the airport to La Florida, steping into the hotel was like entering another world of quietness, beauty and cosy luxury. Check in takes place in a lounge like mini office with 2 desks. I was escorted to my room. As a leading hotels of the world's leaders club member i was upgraded to a corner room with city view. The whole bedroom size is fine, decorated with subtle luxury taste, high ceiling, bathroom rather big with fantastic shower and l'occitane products, flat screen framed tv. Lots of personal touch in the room like my favourite newspaper, cookies, fresh fruits, chocolate box and a gift (candle changing its colour when it's burning). Lots of bottles of water.Dinner at l'orangerie restaurant was a great taste and food experience. It's overpriced for barcelona criterias and prices but in line with gastronomic restaurant prices all over europe. Exceptionnal chilean wine, straberry and mint sorbet. The veal flet and truffles sauce on a brioche slice was devine. One tip before you have dinner there, make sure you book a table by the window and make sure you actually get it as it might not be the case (table reservation handeling is the down side of that place).Perfect slept. I had breakfast at the restaurant's terrace with a terrific view of barcelona. Well appointed buffet with hot/cold, sweet/salted options. After a lazy morning on my balcony, i had a late lunch still at the restaurant terrace. Full lunch menu at 35 euros.I only stayed there 1 night and wish i'd stayed there few more days. Though some pieces of furnitures would need a make over (especially sofas and armchair in the public area) it was like being home in a hotel. Perfect retreat out of busy barcelona where you can spend the day, the hotel provides free shuttle downtown to pla莽a catalunya (20mn drive). La Florida is on my top 3 hotels in the world. ',GOOD,
'Magnificent Urban Oasis Gran Hotel La Florida-July 3,2007Reviewer:Brooklyn NYMagnificant Urban Oasis.My wife and I just returned from 5 days and nights in Barcelona. We had planned on staying the beginning of our trip at La Florida and then stay more centrally at the Majestic in Eixample but loved La Florida so much that we cut short our stay at the Majestic and returned for our last two nights to La Florida. Service was warm, attentive and personal. Check in was a delight as we sat at a table with our front desk person who made sure we had drinks as we went over the details ,.He then brought us to our room while the bellman brought our bags- very classy. In fact service was exemplary and most attentive throughout our stay. The room at the start was huge on the second floor with floor to ceiling windows with a magnificant sweeping view of Barcelona. The bed was a super comfortable King size. The bathroom was similarly huge with double sinksand a separate bath and shower . The pool was spectacular , located both inside and outside and heated just right for a pleasant swim. There was a multi tiered seating area beneath the pool with all seats facing the panoramic view.(One word of caution-if you arrive at the pool too late most seats are already taken sort of like some of the Caribean resorts we have visited so plan ahead a bit to get a seat) Breakfast was delicious with tons of cheese, bread and meats and the setting most romantic outside overlooking Barcelona. We generealy relaxed poolside for a couple of hours before heading into Barcelona by the free Hotel shuttle. The shuttle did tend to fill up so again if you can plan , you should make a reservation in advance. We usually just took a taxi back whenever we wanted to at around 15 Euros. We decided to return for the second portion of our trip because after exploring Barcelona for most of the day into the early evening we wanted to relax at our oasis. Barcelona is a great city but it is loud and crowded and we just wanted to escape at night . If we were only staying a couple of nights perhaps it would have been better to stay in the center of town , but with a more relaxing 5 days we enjoyed our relaxation time at La Florida and still had plenty of time to visit all the sights. When we returned our second room was a little smaller with more normal sized windows but we had a balcony which more than made up for the slightly smaller room-In short La Florida was the perfect hideaway for a 5 day trip to Barcelona. It was the best of both worlds-a luxury resort hotel only about 20 minutes from all the sights. ',GOOD,
'Nicest hotel in 30 years of travel I have traveled extensively, and have stayed in many 5 star hotels. This was by far the lovliest hotel of all my trips. The view is spectacular (ask for ocean/city view), with beautiful decks and lush rooms. The room service was somewhat slow, but we didn't care. The pool here is extraordinary, the spa wonderful. An added bonus for us was a cathedral and AMUSEMENT PARK within walking distance! I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. ',GOOD,
'We loved it ! We just returned from Barcelona 5 days ago. We had 4 nights at the Gran Hotel La Florida. We absolutely loved it. We had hesitated in staying there, because it is on Mt. Tibidabo, a little away from the main parts of the city. Once we arrived, we were thrilled we had chosen this hotel. It was actually a pleasure being away from the city. Barcelona is teeming with people. La Ramblas is kind of seedy. We were disappointed in that area. Lots of guys at night were drunk or on drugs. We went once and then stayed away.Back to the hotel. They were extremely accommodating in getting us transportation anytime into Barcelona. They run a free shuttle throughout the day. We would usually take the shuttle into Barcelona, and then take a taxi home at night. It was easy to get a taxi either way, and cost about 15 Euros. The hotel is physically beautiful. I had read other reviews about the pool area, and it is magnificent. The outside pool area is terraced overlooking the city (the inside pool flows into the outside pool). Breakfast can be outside on the terrace which I highly recommend. The rooms were beautiful. The bathrooms were all beige marble, elegant and spacious. There was a separate shower and tub. The views from all the rooms are gorgeous. All rooms have flat screen TV's (not that we watched very much). The hotel is smaller and more intimate, yet large enough that we felt anonymous when we wanted to be. The staff were extremely helpful. We loved it and would stay again anytime. You would not make a mistake by staying here, even if it is a 15 - 25 min. drive into Barcelona. The drive was nothing and didn't detract in any way from our time in Barcelona. It was a plus. I only wish someone had saved me from agonizing over the decision to stay there vs. in Barcelona. We are very happy we chose this hotel! ',GOOD,
'Great service...NOTTT! 400 euros a night is fine if you get good service but from the momentwe parked our hire car at the front door and lugged our bags in, looking right, then left for reception I had a bad vibe.OK, so what there wasn't a porter to help..things would get better?At reception we had this terribly snooty type that looked down her nose and considered we may be just worthy enough to stay in her fine establishment. Not one smile...not oneRight, I pondered, let's just see what the room was like.Got there, noticed chips on the front door of the mini bar, smallish room but thought what the hell... been travelling for ages, I'm not going to move now.Then we were given the free shuttlebus times to get into Barcelona city centre and noticed that the last bus back to the hotel wasn't 2am, or even midnight but 7.45 pm! So no chance of dinner in Barcelona unless you want an expensive taxi ride back late (accordingto Time Out that would be if you were lucky enough to get a taxi). I complained and got upgraded to a super uber deluxe suite. I said to the General Manager that I just wanted to leave but she informed me we could but would be charged the full room rate, despite the hotel being half full.The hotel is looking a wee bit tired as well-managed to escape after one night and landed up in Hotel Majestic... much better thank you.

'Do not go alone . I have been there on a business trip.I will begin with the negatives.1.I was alone.2. I idid not have car.The place is fantastic, with incredible views of Barcelona, and its the place for a romantic get out.It's not the place for business.This implies that is far from down town, half an hour with car.If you have a car, its ideal. Please take into notice, that there is nothing(restaurant, mini market), lets say at least 10 km from the hotel.The food is around 70 euro per person, which is somehow expensive. Wrapping up, do not go there if you are going with friends to chill out in Barcelona.However, if you want to make your partner a perfect getaway, go.You owe it to yourself . ',GOOD,

'Beautiful location This is a beautifully desined boutique hotel on top of a hill overlooking Barcellona. The view is absolutely breathtaking. The staff at the hotel were very polite and tried to accomodate us the best they could. However, the service industry in Spain generally leaves something to be desired!The rooms were spatious and elegantly designed. The terrace with the bar and the swiming pool are magnificent. Going to Barcellona proper is a trip in itself and the shuttle service is really not frequent enough so if you want to experience Barcellona in its fullest, this hetel is probably not ideal but if your looking for a romantic stay in a secluded, elegant hotel you cant go wrong with this hotel. ',GOOD,
'Nice for the swimming pool Gran Hotel La Florida is a small nice hotel. BUT if you want to compare with other Barcelona hotels like Casa Fuster, i would say you have to make a choice between a nice hot water swimming pool and spartiate room ( Gran Hotel La Florida ) and a very nice room, very clean and well decorated, with lots of bath cream, soaps but ridiculous small pool ( Casa Fuster ).Another detail i did not like at La Florida was the Occitane bath products: in a five star hotel, you can not offer those products! Restaurant, room service was nice at La Florida. At Casa Fuster, room service was too long as they forget my first order.Next time i am in Barcelona, i will probably choose again Casa Fuster. ',GOOD,
'a great hotel with a great view A superb hotel because of its location on Tibidabo hill with a panoramic view of Barcelona, because it is quiet away from the noise of the bustling city and surrounded by green terraces, because of its genial staff, particularly the conciergesand because of its great indoor pool and spa area. L'occitane bathroom amenities are provided. Breakfast offers a rich choice of salmon, cold meets and cheese but the choice of bread and pastries is limited (for example wheat bread is not available).The hotel can be reached by public transport, from the plaza Catalunya, you take the FGC lines S1 or S2, every 10', to the Peu Funicular, then the funicular uphill and the bus del barri 111, every 30', leaving from the funicular station at quarter after and before the hour. Five minutes later, you arrive at the hotel.An alternative is the complementary hotel shuttle, about 7 times a day to the intersection of the Diagonal and the Gracia, but reservation is necessary.Finally, a taxi costs about 鈧?14.The low ranking in the popularity index seems to be biased downwards due to a negative but irrelevant comment.

'Fantasy Palace No question but this is the smartest hotel I came across in Barcelona. It is your private luxury palace and the ultimate in beauty, light, and personal service. The outrageous prices are fully acceptable for what you get. The pool/ spa is top class. The views are amazing, and from all the rooms.BUT and there is one: it is an hour's drive from the city into the mountains. Cab drivers need to be told to take the road to Tibidabo (where the funfair is) or they can spend hours driving in circles. The cabs are cheap enough and it is pleasant and cool when you get there, and such a relief to get out of the city itself. The resort is exclusive and inhabited by the seriously chic and wealthy. If you like that kind of thing or are on honeymoon... ',GOOD,
'How much for a gin and tonic?!?! This was my third trip to Barcelona, (first on my hen weekend, the second at Valentines) and I thought this hotel would be nice. My first mistake was to book a hotel so far away from the centre (silly me) and the second was to book a place so hugely over priced! I had a lovely room with a nice view of the city, a beautiful bathroom and very nice toiletries. A huge plasma TV which seemed to want to fall off the wall! The whole place was lovely, but too far away. We used the free shuttle bus to get into town, but it finished too early for it to be of use to us in the evening. All in all, we spent at least 鈧?0 per day in taxis including the free shuttle service. At the weekend, it was near impossible to get a seat at the times we wanted, and the return journeys were always full, so book ahead if you want to secure a seat.In the evening we had drinks in the bar, the service was better than I had read much to my relief BUT the prices were frightening! On the first night we ate at the restaurant, the starters were lovely, but the mains was too fussy and too many flavours 鈥?the meal costs us over 鈧?80 for 2 people, no desserts, but 2 expensive riojas (鈧?25). Needless to say, we didn鈥檛 eat there again as it was not worth the money.This hotel is suited to couples who want to get away as the whole place is stunning, with views from the pool and bar 鈥?which incidentally is closed after Sept, so we were very disappointed. The rooms are beautiful and well kitted out with very high ceilings. I loved the place, baulked at the prices and got criticised by my husband for the amount of money and distance we had to go to get decent tapas and some night life! For those that have had enough of the touristy Barcelona (does that happen?) and are not shocked at paying 鈧?5 for a gin and tonic, I think they will enjoy this place. ',GOOD,
'Great View Great Staff Great Food This hotel is in a great location. Stayed for a long weekend and never left the property. Having booked a special package i was amazed at how well it all worked. The check in was smooth and efficent, the Spa manager joined us in reception to work out when we wanted the treatments that were part of our package. We were shown to our room and the staff member made sure we were happy with the room and the facilities. We went straight down to the pool which has great views and great areas to lounge about. There were plenty of staff to bring drinks. The only delay seemed to be with food which did take a reasonably long time to arrive but was great when it did.Dinner in the resturant was excellent and not overly priced for the quality. The wine list is long and varied.One of the highlights apart from a massage from Tommy was the Sunday brunch. Huge selection and free Cava. Seemed to be plenty of locals enjoying the views and the food.Some people have commented on a lack of language skills amongst the staff. We certainly didn't find this to be the case. Would we go back. yes.expensive but worth it. ',GOOD,
'Looking for 4/5 star? Skip this hotel. Stayed recently in La Florida with my wife for a week. The hotel has an exceptional view and very nice premises including some spa utilities..but there is a problem: service is really really substandard.Only one janitor and the Italian-born lobby boy were up to their tasks and responsibilities. The rest was a disaster. The excellent food of the very pricey hotel鈥檚 restaurant, L鈥橭rangerie (quick dinner; 250 euros for 2), was totally ruined by very irritating service. Unfortunately I noticed too late that the issue of service had been posted here in previous reviews, even several times.My advice: Not worth spending the money on the view and suffering a very bad service day in day out.

'Be Careful Everything about the hotel was wonderful except the fact that I was robbed, while I took a shower, by one of the maids. The service, spa facilities, room, food and of course the view where all excellent. I had nothing but glowing things to say about the hotel until the next to last night of my stay when I hopped in the shower and closed the door to the bathroom so that the maid could enter and fold down the covers of the bed and leave chocolates and water as they do each night. My husband went down to the business center to check his email and such. I left my backpack, with the wallet inside, by the bed. I heard the maid come in, then go out after a minute or so. I thought nothing of it, but when I got out the bed wasn't done nor were the refreshments left. I thought that it was really strange, but still wasn't completly alarmed until I noticed my backpack looked misplaced and things from my wallet scattered. I opened it and to my panick all of my cash($200) was taken!!! She didn't take my credit cards though but arranged them in a stack in one of the pockets. I know that my wallet was looted during my shower because just before that, I took my debit card and lisence out to give to my husband to put in his wallet for the night out and my wallet was in it's normal state. I had no hard proof other than my honest word and of course she denied it. I had to try and forget about it, but it will have forever tarnished the memory of my trip. I was traumatized that it happened in a five star hotel while I was in my room. The manager said that the maids are used to people leaving valuable things out and never steal, well she picked something that she could get away with that he himself said the cops probably wouldn't come up there for just $200. The amount wasn't the issue it could have been $2. It's the fact that it happened as it did. It's a great hotel but be very careful!!!! ',POOR,
'An Amazing Hotel for a Honeymoon! The hotel was magical and beautiful in more ways than one could describe. The service was outstanding and the views breathtaking. We ventured to the Tibidabo Mtn for our honeymoon and didn't wish to leave because the grandeur service and comfort provided to us by the Hotel. The stainless steel indoor/outdoor infinity pool and spa was a design like no other. Every corner of the hotel was a breathtaking surprise! The hotel design was spectacular and perfectly done. Plan to stay for a minimum of 2 days to truly enjoy all the wonderful amenities. I look forward to returning soon. As a reminder to Americans, there is no need to tip at the restaurants in Spain, it is already included. Enjoy! ',GOOD,
'Awfull service This was my 6th stay at the Hotel and I can agree with other reviews that the service is getting worse and worse. First, even if it seems unbealivable, no one helped us with carrying our luggages to the room. Second, maiden came into the room while we were resting and the not disturb card was on the door. Thay awaked us from our siesta. But what was more amazing is that they phoned us one minute later to ask us when would it be possible to clean our room (they've had 4 hours to do it since we were on the pool having lunch). For lunch, it took for ever for having a club sandwich, almost an hour. And finally, on our check out, no one say a simple thanks while paying the bill, they charged us breakfeast when it was suposeley included in the reservation and we had to wait for our taxi for almost 40 minutes. It is a shame because the hotel is great, rooms are very nice and location is unique. But the service is really pathetic. ',POOR,
'Luxury  I'm frequently travelling to Barcelone and it was my 5th stay in La Florida. The rooms - independend from the cathegory you choose - are all wonderful, very tasteful decorated and mostly offering a spectacular view over the skyline of Barcelone. Fantastic bathrooms and nice amenities. BUT: the service was perfect two years ago, and actually lot of stuff has changed (including the director) and the result is a really unadecuate service for a 5-star hotel. Seems they have reduced also the number of stuff. Still no limousine service and the shuttle service consists about only one shuttle and an inaceptable time-schedule.The worst experience was the breakfast. What this hotel offers for 30,-鈧?! has definitely the level of a 1-star hostal. The restaurant is nice, but nothing special - food arrives cold on the table...My check-out was unbelievable - no concierge, no bellboy - i had to bring all my baggage by myself to my car, avoiding another 30-minutes waiting time...

'Amazing views We stayed at this hotel for one night following a few nights staying in central Barcelona. The position of the hotel is amazing. We had requested a corner room and the hotel had provided this. We had amazing views from the two huge windows and balconies and an amazing view from the huge bathroom window. The room was nice, but not outstanding. The bathroom, however was definitely 5 star.The reception service was great, but the maid service was not so good. They came in to turn down our beds whilst we were at dinner, but failed to replenish wet towels or used toiletries. We were also disturbed by them twice in the morning, depsite the fact that we were checking out.The food and wine in the restuarant was great, but the service was not amazing. I was served fois gras, but it took them another 10 minutes to bring some toast. The main course arrived very quickly after the starter and then it took an hour after finishing our main for them to offer us dessert/coffee.The pool and spa area is really lovely and it was great to swim in the warm outdoor pool looking at views of Barcelona.We thought the shuttle service was great and it was a nice touch to be given a bottle of water on the shuttle.Overall, it is a great hotel, mainly because of the location and views. I would definitely stay there again! ',GOOD,
'good 4-star experience, not quite 5-star and by far not up to "leading hotels".. The hotel is beautifully located on top of a hill that overlooks the entire city. No question - as far as the location and the place in general is concerned - it's as good as it gets.Judging from previous reviews I must conclude that they鈥檝e had a steep learning curve. The service and staff was the most outstanding about this place from the very moment we came in. Warm welcome by multilingual receptionist, short checkin time, no queue etc鈥?br/>The amenities of the hotel are reason enough to go there. Descriptions of the pool, lounge and restaurant can be found in previous reviews.During our stay we noticed several details which I as a frequent traveller appreciate very much:-when calling the reception you will always be addressed in the language used during checkin.-weather forecast and chocolate will be on your bed when coming back from dinner. You will also find a bottle of still water on you bedside table.Following items were disappointing:-the shuttle service virtually not existing鈥? There is just few departures per day. This is especially a problem because out of 6 taxi drivers none knew the hotel. We had to show them on the map, one even refused to take us. The hotel does not offer any alternatives such as a limo service. And honestly 鈥?even if they鈥檇 charge a couple of bucks for it 鈥?it鈥檚 a five star hotel and the 鈥渇ree shuttle鈥?argument doesn鈥檛 really count that much. Transportation must imperatively be provided 鈥?no matter whether for free or not.-The room furniture is beautiful but partly in bad condition. (e.g. there should not be any cables hanging down from behind a flatscreen TV)-Internet reservation did not work (well it worked, but they didn鈥檛 get it鈥?-Entertainment system did not work as it should-The food is ok but by far not what I am used to from hotels of an equivalent category-Air conditioning didn鈥檛 cool below 23.8 degrees CBut after all this is a very good hotel. Obviously you may have high expectations at a place ranked as a 5-star leading small hotel of the world. It would be a top 4-star place but as a 5-star hotel 鈥?which it is 鈥?I am not quite satisfied.And the restaurant 鈥?still being ok 鈥?does not have a Gault Millau rating, comments on the web are anything between bad and good. I my view it鈥檚 nothing special, but the location makes up a lot. I my consideration this hotel is top ten of Barcelona. ',POOR,
'Majestic Facility, Miserable Service My wife and I stayed for three nights at the Gran Hotel La Florida while on our honeymoon this past June. The hotel itself is stunning - gorgeous, very well furnished, and perfectly positioned on Mt. Tibidabo; views of the countryside from one window, views of the downtown Barcelona from another. Excellent pool and poolside facilities, well appointed restaurant. Stunning views (I know I said it before, but it bears repeating).BUT - it is as if the hotel owners refurbished the place to the highest standard, and then simply walked out the door and handed the keys over to their children. The dining room was complete chaos from a staffing perspective. This is particularly disappointing because the kitchen turns out some impressive dishes. We were made to wait nearly two hours for the table we reserved (as guests of the hotel) and, when we finally complained (which is the last thing anyone wants to do when celebrating) the manager offered no apologies, only cava - which, while good, took 20 minutes for him to fetch. Lunch service was similarly unimpressive - nearly two hours (yes, two) for a club sandwich; served with a heaping side of no acknowledgment, no apology, no excuse. One notable exception in the confusion cafe the only one, in fact) was the sommelier - the man knows his wines, is in command of the bottles and glasses, and incredibly personable (his name may be David, but I cannot recall with certainty).The ride down (or up) the mountain is another adventure - cabs wince at the notion of going up the mountain (many will order you out of their car, drive off before you get in or, failing that, wince, complain, and attempt to impose a surcharge for the trouble - do not pay it.) The hotel's shuttle runs on a mid-day only schedule that is obviously more for the benefit of the reservation book at the hotel's restaurant than the guests who stay there (as noted, the restaurant has its own set of problems).Yes, the views are impressive (truly) but be warned - you may tire of them while waiting for your table, cocktail, or lunch!

'A Breathtaking Experiance The hotel perched a 15min drive from the outer skirts of Barcelona (20mins from Airport)on top of the Bilabado Mountain, next to the, so beautiful Catherdral ~ lit up spectaculary at night and so spiritual, over looking the whole city ~ The panaramic views from our 3rd floor duluxe double room were outstanding, inc a terrace (which during the warmer months would of been wonderful! A bit breezy and cold in the new year hols!)The personel are very pleasant especiallly the bar/resturant staff and concierge. Relaxed atmosphere with the most romantic and relaxing Spa. The pool starts inside and ends out side overlooking the city.The drive up and down by taxi into La Ramblas costs around 20euros, however there is a free hopper from the hotel at certain times. Very helpful! The best restuarants we ate in were in Gotic ( Agut ) and The 'Rec' area Little Italy and surrounding cocktail bars and resturants. The highest rated hotel in the centre Jazz hotel also looked nice. Overall our friend proposed to his girlfriend on the balcony of the catherdral and she accepted making this break one of the most relaxing and special weekends away ever! Truly a romantic hotel and location for relaxing or enjoying Barcelona. ',GOOD,
'Top Hotel This is one of the best hotels in the world. The rooms are modern / luxurious with magnificient bathrooms and good space. The terraces have spectacular views of the city. The nearby church and funfare are picturesque. The staff are helpful and discreet. Seasonal reductions make it very affordable too for a 5 star hotel. It's only a shame the room service menus are not more locally-inspired rather than international. However if you want Miami-style Latin luxury in Europe this is the place. Highly recommended. ',GOOD,
'So romantic I booked a late romantic surprise deal and it could not have been better. Great location, superb staff, excellent food and well worth paying a little extra for something and somewhere so special. Its on our must return list so thank you to all those that recommended this hotel. ',GOOD,
'A Truly Spectacular Hotel! I was initially hesitant to book Gran Hotel Florida because it's so far away from the city. It is admittedly not the best place to stay if you want to spend every day in the city, but is well worth a day or two taken out of a hectic tourist itinerary for a bit of relaxation.The rooms are spectacular! I cannot think of one thing I would change. Our room had high ceilings and enormous floor-to-ceiling windows, and although it was one of the least expensive rooms, it was on a corner and had a panoramic view of the city. Overly generous in terms of space, the room included a good sized hallway and two separate his and hers closets. The decor was tasteful and elegant... creams and neutral tones without being the least bit generic (and I am on the picky side about that sort of thing). The floors were hardwood. The bed was comfy. What's more, the room seemed as though it had just been given a fresh coat of paint and a thorough cleaning. It was impeccable!My favorite aspect was the bathroom. To begin with, it was spotless. It was a huge, luxurious space that I actually felt comfortable in. Most hotel bathrooms, even pretty nice ones, can make you feel kind of icky. The bathroom, completely done in travertine, offered a separate tub and shower, two sinks, tons of open shelving, a makeup mirror, towel warmer, bathrobes, plenty of plush towels, and an enclosed toilet area. The shower was phenomenal. It was so big you could have fit 5 people in there. The dual showerhead and high water pressure were heaven. And there was no drain to clog and leave you standing in a pool of water, because the shower uses a system that allows the water to run off the outside edges of the shower to a hidden drain below the floor.Check-in/checkout was an intimate, personal experience. The concierge was able to efficiently help us secure tickets to a show at the last-minute.The only disappointment was the spa. The treatment room for the massage had a clinical feel to it and the masseuse was sub-par. Perhaps I'm used to American spas, which focus mostly on pampering guests.Highly recommend this hotel! ',GOOD,
'A haven on the hill My husband and I spent our honeymoon here and it was wonderful. Beautifully located on Mt Tibidabo with great views of Barcelona. The team were great. I'd describe the service as discreet but warm and friendly. Loved the spa and the restaurant served glorious food. Not cheap though so take plenty of cash. Will definitley return. ',GOOD,
'Amazing service! Amazing hotel! My husband and I just got back and we must say that we could not have been more pleased with the hotel and its service. Unfortunately, the airline lost all of our luggage but the hotel staff bent over backwards to make our time in Barcelona easy and utterly enjoyable nonetheless. In fact, our best meal in Barcelona was at the hotel's restaurant L'Orangerie. If you like small rooms and busy streets, stay in town. If you are looking for romance and world-class relaxation, stay at Gran Hotel La Florida. ',GOOD,
'Spectacular hotel, disappointing service My husband and I booked this hotel as the start of our honeymoon. After getting quite lost trying to find the route to the hotel, we finally arrived at the hotel whose architecture and design are nothing short of breathtaking.The lobby was inviting, decorated with comfortable sofas and bright flowers. The gentleman who checked us in walked us around the hotel, showing us the restaurant, pool, and the sculpture pieces, it was nice to have an inviting welcome. Our room was amazing - corner view of the mountains and the eastern side of the city with huge, two-story windows that went nearly from floor to ceiling - while lying in bed we could see the lights of the city twinkling at night. I also would love to steal this hotel's decor for my own home - beautiful stone sinks and steam shower, beautiful bed linens, huge plasma tv....The pool was great - very chic, and most definitely not a place for kids. The panorama set before you is breathtaking and a great way to spend a relaxing afternoon. I ordered drinks which were fairly reasonably priced (for a 5* hotel). Other reviews complained of noise from the hotel's surroundings - the amusement park was closed the week of our visit, so I can't say how loud that was, but I never noticed any noise from traffic coming up the mountain.Our complaints came from the service. I tried to get recommendations for restaurants IN Barcelona for my birthday dinner - we didn't want to eat at the overpriced hotel restaurant plus we wanted to see the city - but the concierge sent us to this awful tourist-overrun place called Shoko - don't go there. After an awful dinner, we returned to the hotel and when I questioned the desk manager about checking out the next day, he told us we were booked for another night! I told him there must be a misunderstanding, I had told the clerk upon arrival we were staying 2 nights instead of 3, but the desk person was adamant and told us we would be charged for another night if we decided to leave. I was so infuriated!!! Even if it were a misunderstanding, he should have given me the benefit of the doubt! Apparently customer service is a new concept here. I left the lobby in tears, my birthday completely ruined, and went back to our room. The desk manager came to our door 10 minutes later with a curt apology, he had found the notice of our earlier departure in another file. I'm sorry, but that just didn't do it for me. If he wouldn't have found that paper, we would have had to foot the bill for another 300 euros!!!!We'd love to come back, but the staff needs some serious help. ',GOOD,
'Literally on top of the Hill!       The cots and teddy-bears were popular ',GOOD,
'Awful Servie Really nice setting...but the service is so awful that its impossible to enjoy your stay. Service in the restaurant and pool bar is awful. The service in the spa is non-existent...and the overall reaction from management when we complained about the problems was complacent.I emailed the owners of the hotel (The Stein Group) upon my return and got no response... ',POOR,
'Hotel is Stunning But What Service? The hotel is a stunning property. The rooms are expansive and comfortable. The shower was absolutely amazing. The views are spectacular and this is a good hotel if you are looking for some quiet.The service, on the other hand, is non-existent. Some of the staff try very hard while others totally ignore you. We were not allowed to order a salad from the pool menu at the main restaurant, even though they had no salads on their menu and it was 90 degrees. The table next to us at the restaurant was allowed to order from the pool menu. It was very confusing. Getting a simple sandwich at the pool had 1-2 hour wait. We could not get a table at the restauarant for two on Sat. night and were told we can sit and order from the pool menu (which is next to the restauarant). So we opted for room service, which was not any better. While we waited for over an hour for our food, they called us after 30-minutes if they can get the table? Anyhow, I have lots more stories like this. The hotel is gorgeous but it needs to have someone in charge who knows how to run a hotel. ',GOOD,
'Overrated, Overpriced For a hotel rated as 5* gran lux, I was expecting something truly outstanding from this hotel. Sadly, It let us down in a number of areas:* The beautful pool area is situated next to a road and not far from an amusement park, so your relaxation is constantly interrupted by traffic noise and distant screaming.* For a five star hotel, I noticed an astonishing number of maintenance oversights: cracked (and frankly dangerous) floor tiles, scratches and dirty marks on the walls of my room and various other problems.* The hotel is in the middle of nowhere - there's nothing around except the amusement park. Don't be fooled by the minibus service - it runs only 4 times a day and not at all in the evening. So you'll be stuck using the outrageously expensive bar and restaurant. 7 Euros for a glass of draft beer. 15 for a perfectly ordinary club sandwich. The restaurant charges michelin star prices without quality to match. Call me cynical, but I suspect the minibus not running in the evening is a ploy to keep you captive to their overpriced facilities.The view is awesome, but you'd be better off just taking the funicular railway up and taking a walk round than staying up here. Stick to the town instead - there's plenty of better hotels and you get to choose whatever bars and restaurants you want. ',POOR,
'WOW!! What a hotel!! What a gorgeous hotel! It's very close to the amusement park at Mount Tibadabo - don't let that fool you though - this is not a hotel for kids. Luxury doesn't describe it! Very sleek and modern. We spent an entire day relaxing by the stainless steel swimming pool. The pool area is terraced so it's fairly private and affords an unbelievable view of the city all the way to the coast. Despite the haze - we could see the cruise ships in port.We didn't eat at the restaurant but the pool menu was great - we had some American sandwhiches on day 12 of a 14 trip. It was marvelous!! The staff was very nice - there was one gentleman at the concierge who seemed a bit haughty. We were headed to Montserrat and he was really pushing the tour - which didn't meet our timing requirements. We ended up doing the train on our own and are so glad we did. It was marvelous! The hotel is a dream and a perfect, relaxing way to end a hectic vacation! Enjoy!! ',GOOD,
'Amazing views of Barcelona I stayed all-to-briefly at La Florida for business in June 2005. The views of Barcelona are spectacular. The hotel staff is extremely attentive, and the hotel itself is elegant.The lobby is set with red candles and trendly smooth jazz. During check-in, one is greeted with a welcome drink and a comfortable chair to sit. My colleague and I had requested deluxe rooms, and we were pleased to be upgraded to Jr. suites upon checkin! My room had a wrap-around balcony and a wonderful view of the city. I wish I had time to enjoy the spa. It looked very nice.Breakfast buffet was tasty, offering a nice variety of foods. Eggs, sausage, fruit, yoghurt, cereals, meats, cheese, and more. ',GOOD,
'Heaven in the Hills After missing a train from Madrid and driving the five hours to Barcelona with a child, we were beat. We also got terribly lost looking for the hotel, as it sits atop a mountain, and the hour was getting late. Which makes finding this hotel all the better. What a treat. We got to our room, and breathed a collective sigh . The bathroom was beautiful and the shower could've fit 6. We were scheduled for three days and ended up canceling our other reservation and extended our stay for 7 nights. If you want to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle this hotel isn't for you. If you like the idea of a wonderful respite and choosing when you want to go into the city this is for you.The staff is 5 stars, from housekeeping to the bar to pool service to the front house. We had a room with a large deck area, totally private which was wonderful. We could order in and take it outside and have a lovely dinner alfresco in our fluffy robes. The pool is amazing, our son was in heaven with the outside/inside pool option. There was only one other family there, but it wasn't like the kids were doing cannon balls. They were all very behaved. I loved the tierred deck , the view, the spa facilities ( sauna etc..was wonderful after all the travel) . It's a mellow and relaxed vibe, and we felt totally refreshed and ready for our next leg of travel. Our last stay was the the Montage in Laguana Beach and the Ritz Carlton in Dana Point and this was better. Highly recommend, hope to be back soon! ',GOOD,
'Great place ... It would be unfair not to give this hotel an excellent rating due to the history and beauty of the place. It is stunning with amazing views over Barcelona etc. The hotel is only about 4km from the city centre and it will cost you around 15-20 Euros by Taxi each way (this varies a bit depending on the taxi driving and whether he decides to take for a roundtrip!) - although there is a free shuttle service at 12 noon  5pm each day (there may be one later also? ). The rooms and facilities are excellent and the stainless steel pool is the highlight. Staff were friendly and helpful. The thing to watch for is the food - we were disappointed by it - especially the soup of the day. I could have made a better soup with my eyes shut. I think they had boiled the kettle and put an OXO cube in and that was it. ;-) Prices are quite high also. For 2 people, expect to pay 50 Euros at breakfast and around 150 to 250 Euros for an evening meal (although the sky is the limit if you want the best wines/champagne). If you don't want to pay these prices, then your only a short way from the city where you can find just about everything. Overall, you can't fault the hotel, as it really is stunning. Well worth a visit. ',GOOD,
'great place to relax We have just returned from a mid week break. We had a deluxe room with sea-view. The view is absolutely stunning if you get a corner room with 180 degrees of the cityscape. These views facing east get the morning sun. If you like sitting in the evening sun on your balcony then opt for the cheaper mountain view rooms. This is particularly pertinent as there didn't appear to be any public veranda getting the evening sun. the staff were extremely helpful and not at all snooty even though this is a top of the range hotel. the best thing has got to be the stainless steel pool with water outside maintained at 35 degrees. The only downside was that the cold water in the bathroom taps was never cold. Is this to get you to drink the overpriced water in the mini-bar? I would definitely return. ',GOOD,
'Almost, but not quite 5 stars! This review would have started with 5 stars had it not been for the restaurant. We were looking for luxury and pampering after two days of hustle  bustle in the centre of the city.We found it 鈥?the Gran Hotel La Florida, it is fantastic, situated way above the city at the top of Mount Tibidabo. The hotel has the most wonderful views of the city and the surrounding mountains. We had one of the best deluxe rooms in the hotel 311 鈥?two balconies both with amazing views. The room had the biggest bed, Plasma screen and every conceivable luxury you can imagine.The service was excellent throughout the hotel, cava and chocolate dipped strawberries delivered to the room, a bottle of water by each side of the bed every night, all this PLUS the weather report for the following day! The pool area was like a Hollywood nightclub complete with projected TV art, although the service at the pool bar was a little inconsistent. This hotel really is the best we stayed at 鈥?the only let down was the restaurant, the food did not live up to the descriptions on the menu 鈥?David Stein says that his group of hotels have 鈥渕eals that are exquisite, but not pretentious鈥?鈥?the food at L鈥橭rangerie restaurant in the hotel was extremely pretentious. However the lobby and room service food are excellent although the Patatas Bravas portions could have been a little more generous!Overall this hotel is amazing; the views make it extra special. ',GOOD,
'Fantastic Hotel It was our first visit to this hotel. It was fantastic - upon arrival, a member of staff showed us around the hotel and the spa facilities. By the time we finished our tour, our bags were already in our room - the lady proceeded to show us our room and wow! it was a breath taking view. As it was a valentines week-end there were many deals you could go for, however we opted for a deluxe room with a city view and it was worth it. The spa area was brilliant, the pool was great - the staff were great. Clean and to a very good standard. The food was out of this world. For a week-end to pamper yourself great... it is a bit further out of the city, but a taxi ride which took no more then 10 mins into the heart of the city. My advise - if you are going to visit the attractions, hop onto a tour bus, as they stop at the best places and you get discounts into the various attactions. All in all a fab Hotel! ',GOOD,
'Great Hotel, but a few drawbacks I booked this hotel through last minute.com (after consulting this site) and got a great price for Valentine's weekend. Upon our arrival we were informed that we'd been upgraded to the Japanese Suite, 1 of 8 designer suites with private facilities.The room and garden were truly amazing and made for a fantastic weekend. Sadly due to the location in the hotel of the room it didn't actually provide a view, except of the inside of the pool area and the carpark out front. But hey we wanted to visit the city and the view from the terrace made up for it. The price of drinks however was another matter, 13 Euros for 2 glasses of orange juice on our arrival put us off using the bar or the restaurant.Sadly the shuttle bus was out of service for the entire weekend, odd that it was back in service first thing Monday morning, and so every foray down the mountain had to be made by taxi. We went to the same destination 3 times by 3 different routes and 3 different charges. 1 guy even had the front to try to old double back routine on us taking us about a kilometre out of our way to try to bump the fare. I let him know he'd been rumbled as most taxi drivers speak English even if they don't let on. On average expect to pay between 15 - 18 Euros from/to Placa Catalyuna.As stated we avoided the bar etc due to the high prices and took our own drink into the room. We would have appreciated tea  coffee making facilites especially in the mornings, thank God for Starbucks. You would think that in a suite that has a listed rate of 1500 Euros per night you'd at least get a kettle.The pool area was great, it's made of stainless steel and has no deep end. The view from the pool over the city is amazing, especially as you dont have to get out of the water to see it. The pool door was closed but we, as others, ducked under to get outside.The staff I encountered were all very courteous, even the guy who came to check our mini bar at 22:35! and I can recommend this hotel. However I do suggest that bookings are made though a third party as the savings can be vast.I can say that I would stay here again. ',GOOD,
